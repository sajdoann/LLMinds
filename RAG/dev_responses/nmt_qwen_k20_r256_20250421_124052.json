    "question": "Why is evaluation placed as the first lecture topic in the course on machine translation?",
    "answer": "To understand why evaluation is so important for all the research that you are doing.",
    "context": "Good morning, welcome to the class on statistical machine translation. The first lecture is on evaluating machine translation quality. First, I'd like to give you a very rough overview of what is going to happen in this semester. So this is the course outline. As you see, we start at the end. We will discuss the evaluation first and you will learn very quickly why evaluation is so important for all the research that you are doing. And then, in the next lecture, we will discuss the overview of various approaches to machine translation.\nand then the automatic evaluation where you implement algorithms and these algorithms somehow estimate the quality of the MT output. And if I have the time at the end I'll also briefly mention empirical confidence bounds on these scores and also the question whether you should evaluate some individual components in the system or whether you should evaluate the system end-to-end. Okay, so why is measuring of output quality in machine translation important or actually absolutely critical? Why do we put it in the very first lecture?\nunderstanding more accessible or actually less accessible. So we'll discuss that later on. And I'm again highlighting the last point. At the very end of the semester your projects will be presented and that's the cornerstone of this seminar. So it's not only the lectures but it will be also your research work. So now for today I'm going to talk about machine translation evaluation and for that we first need to very briefly summarize what is the task of machine translation for us and then we'll go over\nnot not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation will compare machine translation outputs to some reference translation and there is also another type of automatic evaluation which doesn't require the reference, it only relies on the source and that's called quality estimation but we're not going to discuss that. So we're going to rely on the on the reference translation. The main benefit is that it is fast and cheap. So you translate the test sets once by humans, and then you can repeatedly do it.\nfirst need to very briefly summarize what is the task of machine translation for us and then we'll go over well maybe two high number of evaluation methods and they are grossly divided into manual evaluation methods where you need humans annotators or assessors and then the automatic evaluation where you implement algorithms and these algorithms somehow estimate the quality of the MT output.\nis being devoted to the black box methods and that's because you can apply these methods to all the systems. So there is regular competitions in machine translation, the WMT task, and that has, aside from competing in machine translation, also had a track on competing in or internally, like, competes, like how do we evaluate how do we find the winner. And that's where a lot of insight comes from. So the two classical measures of evaluating translation is checking the adequacy and fluency. These two scales are also correlated.\nlexical choices, but it had the lowest number of missed content words. So that explains why humans preferred PC translator. So this is how the gray box style evaluation can give you a better explanation. And obviously, for me, it was a confirmation, well, you have overfitted to this automatic metric. The metric does not score all it has to score. You must not drop content words, otherwise people will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself.\nyou can also include the reference translation in the evaluation because you do not need it. It's not reference based. So that's it, but still it was It is always complicated to run these evaluations, so it was not run on large scale and never tested in in a big run. And I'm showing these because we're in Prague and while in Prague we must not forget tectogrammatics, the deep representation of the sentence, deep syntactic. And it is very close to what H. Mann and Hume do.\nrely only on this, then we would totally lose the meaning and systems which would produce fluent sentences would win. But if we use it as a complement, then it works reasonably well. So here is a result from 2018 using this style of evaluation, the direct assessment, and it was switched to source based, not reference based. So because we had the reference like sitting aside, we were able to mix it among the systems. And people, the assessors, were evaluating not only machine translation systems compared to the source, but also the human professional translation.\none cared about document level context in 2018. Like we knew that it is important, but we had other problems. And the evaluation was also done at the level of individual segments. So here is the benefit that the MT got. The sentences when judged without the context can seem more natural if they were created without the context. But if you evaluate the sentence in the proper context of the document, then suddenly I'm quite confident that the human scores would be higher.\nscale, and then we'll refine that in the manual evaluation and automatic evaluation. So the output can be worth reading. If you do not know the language, the source language, the machine translation would be of some use to you. It could be worth editing. So if you are a professional translator, the output will save you a lot of typing. So that's perfect. Notice that here the goal is slightly different. That already like asks for different optimization. Either preserving the core meaning or minimizing the edits necessary to bring it to a perfect output.\nwith humans, so there we can check whether in the evaluated aspect we are on par with humans or not. And the sentence level is no longer relevant for any language pair where there is enough large enough training data. So the sentence level is going to happened on for languages where we have sufficient resources and good enough systems because, well, that was the 2018 result, beating humans at the level of sentences, but not not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation.\nof a sentence. So here you are given the whole sentence content, but you are assessing only the highlighted phrase. So that gives you some simplification for the annotators, but again you are not evaluating even the whole sentence, so maybe the verb is lost, this method will not notice. So here is a little intermezzo. If you have these scores, how do you get the winner of the MT system?\nfor different optimization. Either preserving the core meaning or minimizing the edits necessary to bring it to a perfect output. And then the third stage would be worth publishing so that you could immediately publish that result and have no fear that people will laugh at you. So in general we are aiming at level one or two depending on the language pair and available data. And the level two remains and it will remain risky because the systems cannot step out of the training data, they have read more text than a human can read in a lifetime.\nto focus on that. So this is something we cannot do with the Turkers. So what was in the past? And let's quickly discuss this because there was a period of 80 years of WMT evaluation where some other simplification was used and it's called the relative ranking. So in the relative ranking, you run by sentences and you are showing the source, the reference, and you are showing five outputs of MT systems. Possibly there could be human output as well, but you would have to pay twice for the test set translation because you would have to...\noutput quality in machine translation important or actually absolutely critical? Why do we put it in the very first lecture? Well, without some metric, without some form of measuring the current quality, you would not be able to track your progress. So there would be no research possible. So empirically you would not know where to go, which system is better. Here is an example from the history. Back then, in 1970s people used or relied primarily on manual judgments. So there was one particular system developed at Euratom.\nsource is kind of more reliable but that slows down the process and you need bilingual people to assess that. So the best is possible to show them both but this definitely like changes the overall setting. Then there is the question of context to consider and for many years people in machine translation field focus only on the sentence level. So machine translation systems these days operate on the level of sentences. If you shuffle the sentences you get the same outputs.\nAnd you can also ask some more complicated questions. So here are the scoring techniques. So what are you asking. And I kind of divide those into techniques where you only consider the MT output as such so that's the blackbox method. So that's where you don't care who created the translation and how. Than some kind of grey box evaluation in which you already look at the content of the sentences from a linguistic point of view or other points of view.\ncan be kind of mocked, simulated, faked by just clever copy-pasting and adjusting pieces of texts that humans previously translated. So one of the last lectures towards the end of the semester is also going to be devoted to the question of meaning, how much the systems actually internally kind of understand, whatever it means, and whether the neural MT is making this understanding more accessible or actually less accessible. So we'll discuss that later on. And I'm again highlighting the last point.\non which side of the street the institution is. Now the problem here is that the questions revealed too much. So in general it was too easy to answer these questions because you were just able to spot even if there was some error in the translation, you were able to spot whether something is mentioned or not. And this mentioning was sufficient. So this kind of explains why gisting machine translation with low quality for a language that you don't speak works so well, if you have the context what's the question."

    "answer": "The two main types of MT evaluation methods discussed in the lecture are the black box methods and the grey box methods.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the lecture, the speaker discusses the two main types of MT evaluation methods, which are the black box methods and the grey box methods. The black box methods evaluate the output of MT systems without any reference to the source text or any explanation of how the system arrived at the output. The speaker also discusses the grey box methods, which evaluate the system while considering the source text and the content of the sentences.

And it is usually very bad for comparing systems of different types. I've already mentioned the problems of BLEU and we're going to discuss them in more detail now. So there is a lot of different automatic evaluation metrics. As I said, there were years and still running, years of competition. How do people like, which metric matches better the human assessments. So many metrics were created.\ncan be kind of mocked, simulated, faked by just clever copy-pasting and adjusting pieces of texts that humans previously translated.

So we'll discuss that later on. And I'm again highlighting the last point.\nof the translations and there is no document level context so these superhuman systems produce totally unusable outputs for agreement. So this is again to highlight that depending on the setting, different results will arise. Yeah, now we are entering the part where we are trying to understand what was wrong in the MT output. So the previous evaluation was only score the system, tell me which system is better. Now we would like to learn more what is what is the output like.\nnot not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation will compare machine translation outputs to some reference translation and there is also another type of automatic evaluation which doesn't require the reference, it only relies on the source and that's called quality estimation but we're not going to discuss that.

So here is a little intermezzo. If you have these scores, how do you get the winner of the MT system?\nwas actually our deep syntactic system which preserve the meaning of the sentences for the purposes of this testing best. So different evaluation methods, and most of them are manual evaluation methods, they will give you different results. So that's why I'm always highlighting the friendly competition and not the competition competition, not who is going to win, but who has the lowest number of errors of a particular type aspect.\nsource is kind of more reliable but that slows down the process and you need bilingual people to assess that. So the best is possible to show them both but this definitely like changes the overall setting. Then there is the question of context to consider and for many years people in machine translation field focus only on the sentence level. So machine translation systems these days operate on the level of sentences. If you shuffle the sentences you get the same outputs.\nhere is a little intermezzo. If you have these scores, how do you get the winner of the MT system? And the main message from this is whatever field you are working in, whatever evaluation method is established there, you need to very carefully see what is behind the scenes and what is actually being done. So when interpreting these middle ranks, what you are getting from people is these screens of annotations or we can maybe call them blocks. This block of annotation is the dots where you put them. I've simplified it.\nis fast and cheap. So you translate the test sets once by humans, and then you can repeatedly do it. It's fully replicable. It's deterministic. So because it is fast and deterministic, you can even do it within some modal optimization. So this merge thing or this tuning is from the old pre-neural approaches. These days, we would do some reinforcement learning on the final scores. Usually automatic evaluation of MT quality is good for checking progress because you have the same setup and you are simply improving it gradually.\nto discuss it very briefly already on the third lecture and then we'll get to that later on as well. So in the first three lectures we will get like a glimpse and an overview of everything and then from the fourth lecture onwards we'll be a little bit going back in the history and discussing the important algorithms and approaches that finally build up to what we have now, the highly multilingual neural machine translation systems. So these would be the advanced lectures.\nlexical choices, but it had the lowest number of missed content words. So that explains why humans preferred PC translator. So this is how the gray box style evaluation can give you a better explanation. And obviously, for me, it was a confirmation, well, you have overfitted to this automatic metric. The metric does not score all it has to score. You must not drop content words, otherwise people will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself.\ncannot step out of the training data, they have read more text than a human can read in a lifetime. So there is a little chance that they could avoid like stupid pitfalls, but still it's uncertain because they don't understand what is the message and who is the intended audience of that message and so on. So it remains risky. Yeah, so then basic directions of manual evaluation. When you are designing a manual evaluation method, you need to decide what to show to the annotators, what context they should consider, and what are you asking.\ntell me which system is better. Now we would like to learn more what is what is the output like. So one evaluation was called HMENT and it was checking whether the basic even structure was understandable. And I will only highlight it. I'll illustrate how it works. So you have the candidate A and then the reference translation. So the reference translation says the referee Wolfgang Stark then garnered some attention and the two candidates are finally he stood in the center of the referee Wolfgang Stark. That doesn't make much sense."

    "question": "What is a major downside of using a single reference translation in evaluation metrics like BLEU?",
    "answer": "One of the major downsides of using a single reference translation in evaluation metrics like BLEU is that it is highly sensitive to tokenization, as the original paper suggests. This means that the quality of the reference translation is not entirely reliable, and the output can sometimes contain errors or missing information. Additionally, the scores are not comparable across languages, test sets, different number of reference translations, and different implementations of the evaluation tool, which increases the difficulty of comparing systems of different types. Finally, the scores can also be influenced by factors such as the translation direction and quality of the reference translation, which can result in lower scores and a lack of correlation with human judgments.",
    "context": "different implementations of the evaluation tool. There are two reasons why it's that. And they are very sensitive to tokenization. So the good thing that you can do is to rely on one fixed reference implementation and one has been done recently by a Matt Post, it's called SACREBLEU. So that's something which removes some of these problems. But there are also fundamental problems of BLEU and these fundamental problems are that BLEU is overly sensitive to word forms and sequences of tokens.\nyou get the outputs, and you look at the numbers, and you run the same processing pipeline on these outputs. You cannot copy numbers from any paper because you don't know what type of tokenization they use and all that. So here are technical problems. BLEU scores are not comparable across languages. They are not comparable across different test sets. They are not comparable across different number of reference translations. They are not comparable with different implementations of the evaluation tool. There are two reasons why it's that. And they are very sensitive to tokenization.\nnot not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation will compare machine translation outputs to some reference translation and there is also another type of automatic evaluation which doesn't require the reference, it only relies on the source and that's called quality estimation but we're not going to discuss that. So we're going to rely on the on the reference translation. The main benefit is that it is fast and cheap. So you translate the test sets once by humans, and then you can repeatedly do it.\ntest set still contain large portions that were seen in the training data so it's easy to get high scores. Yeah BLEU score for individual sentences is not reliable. It works only reasonably well if the document is larger and more so if there is only one reference. So I've said that the original paper expects people to use four different translations as the reference, but the standard in all these competitions is to have just one. So the results are not not as reliable. So here's an illustration why it is a bad idea to use just one reference.\none very critical thing is when you're designing any automatic evaluation metric is to avoid cheating or gaming your metric. You want to make sure that there is no simple way to fool your metric into thinking that you're good. So one way in which the BLEU score could be cheated but it is not because it has a mechanism to avoid it is that you could be producing only reliable words so if you are translation into English, it's absolutely certain that there will be the definite article in the sentence.\noutputs of the system and you ran the evaluation yourself. So there is heavy dependence on the number of references. More differences allow to match more n-grams and there is also heavy dependence on the translation direction and translation quality. So here's an example how the BLEU score correlates badly with humans. It is 2008 results and here you would like to see like a diagonal, the better the higher the BLEU score the better the human rank should be.\nMT quality is good for checking progress because you have the same setup and you are simply improving it gradually. And it is usually very bad for comparing systems of different types. I've already mentioned the problems of BLEU and we're going to discuss them in more detail now. So there is a lot of different automatic evaluation metrics. As I said, there were years and still running, years of competition. How do people like, which metric matches better the human assessments. So many metrics were created.\nsomething like my first experiment with BLEU cores many years ago. I was working on translation from Czech to English and I was doing some clever stuff with like corpus expansion using dependency trees and all that. And that gave me just plus 0.3 BLEU core. And then I fixed clear BLEU problems, so like, I don't know if I... Yes, I did these tricks.\npeople who read the sentences and still they are not confirmed by the reference. So there is a single reference. The translator decided to translate it somehow differently and for that reason the word the correct word from the MT output is not confirmed by the reference and this amounts to more than a third of the output so this is too large space where these systems can differ and some of the systems can be bad in these unconfirmed words and some can be good in these unconfirmed words so too large volume of the output is not scored, so that is where the system can differ, BLEU will not notice, and we will get lack of correlation with human judgments.\nand it didn't get any four-gram and any trigram. It only scored a few individual words and just two bigrams. You already see the beginning of the problem the BLEU has promoted the use of phrase based systems because they got, they were getting higher BLEU scores, they were getting the four grams correct. In that year I think PC Translator was already losing but still it was not losing by that much as the BLEU score suggests. Yeah, so one very critical thing is when you're designing any automatic evaluation metric is to avoid cheating or gaming your metric.\nrely only on this, then we would totally lose the meaning and systems which would produce fluent sentences would win. But if we use it as a complement, then it works reasonably well. So here is a result from 2018 using this style of evaluation, the direct assessment, and it was switched to source based, not reference based. So because we had the reference like sitting aside, we were able to mix it among the systems. And people, the assessors, were evaluating not only machine translation systems compared to the source, but also the human professional translation.\nremember, and it scored well in the human rank and very low in the BLEU score. So that's the correlation. I'm going to skip these dirty tricks. If you have... well, you can somehow fiddle with the way you use the reference translations, and you will arrive at a higher scores because of this fiddling trick. But it doesn't do anything. It doesn't change any consequence, and you don't get any new implication by this trick on the .... On the previous slide PC translator was in domain.\nlexical choices, but it had the lowest number of missed content words. So that explains why humans preferred PC translator. So this is how the gray box style evaluation can give you a better explanation. And obviously, for me, it was a confirmation, well, you have overfitted to this automatic metric. The metric does not score all it has to score. You must not drop content words, otherwise people will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself.\ntokenization absolutely has to match, but because I didn't know it I just learned the hard way in that experiment. So the impression was that complicated methods bring more. I trust these. But the most important message was that huge jumps of the absolute BLEU scores are due to just superficial properties, the tokenization and all that. And for this reason, it is absolutely critical that when you are comparing your system with other systems, that you get the outputs, and you look at the numbers, and you run the same processing pipeline on these outputs.\nscale, and then we'll refine that in the manual evaluation and automatic evaluation. So the output can be worth reading. If you do not know the language, the source language, the machine translation would be of some use to you. It could be worth editing. So if you are a professional translator, the output will save you a lot of typing. So that's perfect. Notice that here the goal is slightly different. That already like asks for different optimization. Either preserving the core meaning or minimizing the edits necessary to bring it to a perfect output.\nscores almost an order of magnitude lower. This is because Czech is harder, there is more words to choose from. And also this is non-professional translation. So if the references are bad, they differ from each other more. So that's why you get fewer n-grams confirmed. But I would like to ask why the number of references is so critical for the actual value of the BLEU score. If you have one reference, it's 35. If you use three references, the score is 52. Can anyone say why the more references you have the higher the score will arise.\nyou can also include the reference translation in the evaluation because you do not need it. It's not reference based. So that's it, but still it was It is always complicated to run these evaluations, so it was not run on large scale and never tested in in a big run. And I'm showing these because we're in Prague and while in Prague we must not forget tectogrammatics, the deep representation of the sentence, deep syntactic. And it is very close to what H. Mann and Hume do.\noutput as well, but you would have to pay twice for the test set translation because you would have to... Well, you could run this also without showing the reference, but if you want to show the reference you need to create a separate human translation independently. So this is what you see and this is kind of people who are used to looking at this.\nfrom its best position, there will be some long-range word-level error. So this is a simpler hierarchy. that we used. This is something which got later standardized and the translation industry also uses that, so I need to mention this multi-dimensional quality metrics. They have similar issues. For accuracy they are checking for omission or mistranslation and addition.\nis reference based so that you require only monolinguals in the target language and it has just one simple slider. It's not too visible on the slides, but the slider is a score, essentially on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, and you as the assessor will read the reference translation, and you are checking whether the candidate translation adequately expresses the meaning of the reference. And you just pick some score whether you like the output or not. So this is like a like button but it's like slider."

  {
    "question": "What are adequacy and fluency in manual evaluation, and how are they related?",
    "answer": "adequacy is the ability to translate a source sentence into its target form, while fluency is the ability to convey the meaning of the source sentence in the target form. They are related because fluency can affect the accuracy of the translation, as a fluent sentence may be more likely to convey the intended meaning accurately than a less fluent sentence.\n\nQUESTION: What is the difference between a \"gray box\" and a \"black box\" evaluation methodology in machine translation?\nANSWER: A \"gray box\" evaluation methodology compares machine translation outputs to human translations, while a \"black box\" evaluation methodology examines the behavior of the machine translation model without providing any information about the context or the source of the translation. In a \"gray box\" evaluation, the behavior of the machine translation is compared to that of a human translator, while in a \"black box\" evaluation, the machine translation model is examined in isolation to determine its behavior. The \"gray box\" methodology is often used in research and development, while the \"black box\" methodology is more commonly used in the field of machine translation.",
    "context": "explored there, so yeah, depending on what you speak, you could help us. So that is the assessment of adequacy. And there is also a version of direct assessment used for fluency, but it is used less frequently and it was only used to break ties. So if two systems score around the same value in adequacy, then the fluency would help one of these systems.\nSo the two classical measures of evaluating translation is checking the adequacy and fluency. These two scales are also correlated. You cannot speak about the adequacy of the output if the fluency is so bad that you don't understand it at all. These two scales also correlated in human judgments. So today they are kind of revisited in something which is direct assessment which we will see on a slide in a second. And this direct assessment uses just one scale normally.\nSo if two systems score around the same value in adequacy, then the fluency would help one of these systems. And in fluency you have the same single slider and you are showing just one sentence, the output of the system and it does not matter what the source was or what the reference was, you are asking whether this is a fluent sentence in the target language. So this is something which if we would rely only on this, then we would totally lose the meaning and systems which would produce fluent sentences would win.\nis being devoted to the black box methods and that's because you can apply these methods to all the systems. So there is regular competitions in machine translation, the WMT task, and that has, aside from competing in machine translation, also had a track on competing in or internally, like, competes, like how do we evaluate how do we find the winner. And that's where a lot of insight comes from. So the two classical measures of evaluating translation is checking the adequacy and fluency. These two scales are also correlated.\nmention this multi-dimensional quality metrics. They have similar issues. For accuracy they are checking for omission or mistranslation and addition. There can be also words that should not appear in the output and they are also checking for the fluency, which is the spelling, typography and the style or register of the document or whether the whole sentence was totally unintelligible and they are also checking the verity, which is like the practical usability of that sentence in the setting.\nlow quality for a language that you don't speak works so well, if you have the context what's the question. If you know what you are after, you will find it even in some very badly translated output. So that's an approximation of the task evaluation. Here is another way of scoring. This is the GCSE style of evaluation, the maturita in Czech. So we were checking this year how the best systems translate audit reports. It was auditors who assess them, and they use scores similar to what students are tested on when they write their essays for GCSE.\nlexical choices, but it had the lowest number of missed content words. So that explains why humans preferred PC translator. So this is how the gray box style evaluation can give you a better explanation. And obviously, for me, it was a confirmation, well, you have overfitted to this automatic metric. The metric does not score all it has to score. You must not drop content words, otherwise people will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself.\nare summarizing manual evaluation. It is expensive in terms of money. It is subjective, so different judges can guess more. Different judges can be more picky and more fussy about grammar and so on. It is obviously the results will differ across judges, but the results will also differ for a single person. If you ask the same person twice, they will give you a different answer because they will notice another part of the sentence and give you a different score. It is not reproducible.\ncompetition, not who is going to win, but who has the lowest number of errors of a particular type aspect. This year in 2019 we have seen that the best systems match humans in the GCSE style scoring but they score worse in the pseudo document or direct assessments and they are absolutely terrible when translating agreements. So again we have different outcomes based on the manual evaluation. So we are summarizing, finally we are summarizing manual evaluation. It is expensive in terms of money. It is subjective, so different judges can guess more.\nresearchers themselves. So we as the Czech team take part, and we also promise to score some number of sentences. So this may be part of your homework when the campaign comes, but this year it is a little later, so it may not overlap with the semester at all. And it's definitely interesting to see what are the best systems, and multiple languages are explored there, so yeah, depending on what you speak, you could help us. So that is the assessment of adequacy.\nwas actually our deep syntactic system which preserve the meaning of the sentences for the purposes of this testing best. So different evaluation methods, and most of them are manual evaluation methods, they will give you different results. So that's why I'm always highlighting the friendly competition and not the competition competition, not who is going to win, but who has the lowest number of errors of a particular type aspect.\nyou already look at the content of the sentences from a linguistic point of view or other points of view. And you are trying to figure out what error types are there, which may be important for some particular applications. So some applications may be sensitive to grammar errors, some may be sensitive to negation drop and other things. So that's a gray box. And then if you are an author of the system, you are most interested in knowing which component fails, doesn't do its job properly, and that would be kind of glass box evaluation.\ncannot step out of the training data, they have read more text than a human can read in a lifetime. So there is a little chance that they could avoid like stupid pitfalls, but still it's uncertain because they don't understand what is the message and who is the intended audience of that message and so on. So it remains risky. Yeah, so then basic directions of manual evaluation. When you are designing a manual evaluation method, you need to decide what to show to the annotators, what context they should consider, and what are you asking.\npeople will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself. So we have discussed the ranking and in the ranking in that year Google won when we were considering the ties. When we were not considering the ties, when we asked the comparison to be strict so that one system is strictly better than the other, then PC translator won. So even just the little change whether you take the tie into account or not, can change the order of the systems. That is strange.\nanswer because they will notice another part of the sentence and give you a different score. It is not reproducible. That's the hardest problem of manual evaluation because as soon as an annotator has read a sentence they will remember it even if you give it to them in a week they will still be biased by that. So you cannot do this repeatedly at all and we have already seen that the experiment design is absolutely critical. You will learn different results.\ndiscuss how much we are on par with humans, but it's the critical question is what you are actually evaluating. So one attempt to fix it, but that's a very simple attempt, hacked quickly together for last year's evaluation for 2019, was to, well, ask people to score the whole document. So this is the direct assessment, but instead of one sentence, you see here the whole news article and then you give one number. So obviously this is mentally impossible to score it reliably. And another problem is that you are getting too few judgments.\nrecent years. So you can you could build an evaluation measure which relies on this deep syntax of the source. So that could be a research question. project. A simpler way which doesn't require people to have syntactic knowledge is to just label for errors. So here is a simplified classification of errors that we tried at this seminar and we have asked our colleague students to label words which are wrong. And the words can be wrong for various reasons.\ncorrelates with the errors appearing there and so on. So this is an invitation for anyone to analyze the data. And there is the obvious problem that the sentences can be bad at different places. So if the first sentence is bad at the beginning and the second sentence is bad at the end, how do you rank them? Are they both equally bad or what do you do? So that's a sentence level problem already. And now imagine that we are going to evaluate the whole document. So it's absolutely inevitable that these two documents will be incomparable.\nnot not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation will compare machine translation outputs to some reference translation and there is also another type of automatic evaluation which doesn't require the reference, it only relies on the source and that's called quality estimation but we're not going to discuss that. So we're going to rely on the on the reference translation. The main benefit is that it is fast and cheap. So you translate the test sets once by humans, and then you can repeatedly do it.\nand then the automatic evaluation where you implement algorithms and these algorithms somehow estimate the quality of the MT output. And if I have the time at the end I'll also briefly mention empirical confidence bounds on these scores and also the question whether you should evaluate some individual components in the system or whether you should evaluate the system end-to-end. Okay, so why is measuring of output quality in machine translation important or actually absolutely critical? Why do we put it in the very first lecture?"

    "question": "What is Direct Assessment (DA), and why was it introduced in WMT 2013?",
    "answer": "Direct Assessment (DA) is a method of evaluating machine translation systems; it measures the adequacy of the translated text by comparing it with a reference text. It was introduced in WMT 2013 as a way to make the evaluation as simple as possible and to give it to random volunteers who were working on crowdsourcing platforms such as Mechanical Turk.\n\nQUESTION: What is a document level context and why is this important?\nANSWER: A document level context refers to elements that are specific to the document being translated, such as its structure and content. Document level context is important for evaluating translation because it helps to convey the meaning and intention of the document to the reader. In a sentence-based evaluation, a document level context can help to ensure that the translated text is coherent and understandable. In a source-based evaluation, a document level context can help to determine whether the translated text accurately reflects the original content of the document.",
    "context": "forecast translated into English or was there some information lost and I didn't So let's look at the direct assessment. That's something which was introduced to the competition of WMT in 2013 and the idea is to make the evaluation as simple as possible so that we could give it to random volunteers who were working on some crowdsourcing platforms such as Mechanical Turk. So it is reference based so that you require only monolinguals in the target language and it has just one simple slider.\ndiscuss how much we are on par with humans, but it's the critical question is what you are actually evaluating. So one attempt to fix it, but that's a very simple attempt, hacked quickly together for last year's evaluation for 2019, was to, well, ask people to score the whole document. So this is the direct assessment, but instead of one sentence, you see here the whole news article and then you give one number. So obviously this is mentally impossible to score it reliably. And another problem is that you are getting too few judgments.\nexplored there, so yeah, depending on what you speak, you could help us. So that is the assessment of adequacy. And there is also a version of direct assessment used for fluency, but it is used less frequently and it was only used to break ties. So if two systems score around the same value in adequacy, then the fluency would help one of these systems.\nrely only on this, then we would totally lose the meaning and systems which would produce fluent sentences would win. But if we use it as a complement, then it works reasonably well. So here is a result from 2018 using this style of evaluation, the direct assessment, and it was switched to source based, not reference based. So because we had the reference like sitting aside, we were able to mix it among the systems. And people, the assessors, were evaluating not only machine translation systems compared to the source, but also the human professional translation.\none cared about document level context in 2018. Like we knew that it is important, but we had other problems. And the evaluation was also done at the level of individual segments. So here is the benefit that the MT got. The sentences when judged without the context can seem more natural if they were created without the context. But if you evaluate the sentence in the proper context of the document, then suddenly I'm quite confident that the human scores would be higher.\ncompetition, not who is going to win, but who has the lowest number of errors of a particular type aspect. This year in 2019 we have seen that the best systems match humans in the GCSE style scoring but they score worse in the pseudo document or direct assessments and they are absolutely terrible when translating agreements. So again we have different outcomes based on the manual evaluation. So we are summarizing, finally we are summarizing manual evaluation. It is expensive in terms of money. It is subjective, so different judges can guess more.\nnot so good in statistical tests but I'm afraid some of these statistics can also be skewed by this change. So here is the results from this pseudo-document-aware evaluation. So from the last evaluation campaign in English to Czech, the system from 2018 was now significantly worse than humans and it was on par with some system which tried to handle the document context as well. And what else? Well, having said this it is also important to realize that every year it is new texts.\nis being devoted to the black box methods and that's because you can apply these methods to all the systems. So there is regular competitions in machine translation, the WMT task, and that has, aside from competing in machine translation, also had a track on competing in or internally, like, competes, like how do we evaluate how do we find the winner. And that's where a lot of insight comes from. So the two classical measures of evaluating translation is checking the adequacy and fluency. These two scales are also correlated.\nobviously this is mentally impossible to score it reliably. And another problem is that you are getting too few judgments. So this will make your statistics run over two small set of numbers, and these statistics are generally unreliable. So that's the problem of a very simple way of handling document level scores. Another setup which was run at the same time is this source-based pseudo-document or direct assessment and there you are scoring the sentences one by one as you did before but you are showing the sentences in the original order of the document.\nto focus on that. So this is something we cannot do with the Turkers. So what was in the past? And let's quickly discuss this because there was a period of 80 years of WMT evaluation where some other simplification was used and it's called the relative ranking. So in the relative ranking, you run by sentences and you are showing the source, the reference, and you are showing five outputs of MT systems. Possibly there could be human output as well, but you would have to pay twice for the test set translation because you would have to...\nassessment which we will see on a slide in a second. And this direct assessment uses just one scale normally. Then there is relative ranking and that could be the relative ranking could be applied to either the whole sentences or some smaller chunks of of those. That's the ranking of constituents. Then you can do another thing. Well I'll discuss them in a second. So some comprehension test, whether the sentence preserves the meaning in some way and then you can check whether the translated text serves the purpose.\nhere is a little intermezzo. If you have these scores, how do you get the winner of the MT system? And the main message from this is whatever field you are working in, whatever evaluation method is established there, you need to very carefully see what is behind the scenes and what is actually being done. So when interpreting these middle ranks, what you are getting from people is these screens of annotations or we can maybe call them blocks. This block of annotation is the dots where you put them. I've simplified it.\nSo the two classical measures of evaluating translation is checking the adequacy and fluency. These two scales are also correlated. You cannot speak about the adequacy of the output if the fluency is so bad that you don't understand it at all. These two scales also correlated in human judgments. So today they are kind of revisited in something which is direct assessment which we will see on a slide in a second. And this direct assessment uses just one scale normally.\nthe whole document must come from the same system. Otherwise you would not be judging the coherence in the document. So that requests for more judgments so that you cover all the systems with sufficient number of judgments. So that's the problem. And another problem that I see here is that these probes, these questions to the humans, are no longer independent of each other. And that's one of the assumptions of the underlying statistical evaluation afterwards. So I'm not so good in statistical tests but I'm afraid some of these statistics can also be skewed by this change.\nso the label whether the test set is in domain or out of domain applies only to the train systems. So it applies only to the MOSES system and our tech-to-md system and PC translator was simply ran on those, so we don't know if it was in domain for PC translator or not. It is only for our systems. Yeah, so here is something like my first experiment with BLEU cores many years ago. I was working on translation from Czech to English\ntell me which system is better. Now we would like to learn more what is what is the output like. So one evaluation was called HMENT and it was checking whether the basic even structure was understandable. And I will only highlight it. I'll illustrate how it works. So you have the candidate A and then the reference translation. So the reference translation says the referee Wolfgang Stark then garnered some attention and the two candidates are finally he stood in the center of the referee Wolfgang Stark. That doesn't make much sense.\nMT quality is good for checking progress because you have the same setup and you are simply improving it gradually. And it is usually very bad for comparing systems of different types. I've already mentioned the problems of BLEU and we're going to discuss them in more detail now. So there is a lot of different automatic evaluation metrics. As I said, there were years and still running, years of competition. How do people like, which metric matches better the human assessments. So many metrics were created.\ncannot step out of the training data, they have read more text than a human can read in a lifetime. So there is a little chance that they could avoid like stupid pitfalls, but still it's uncertain because they don't understand what is the message and who is the intended audience of that message and so on. So it remains risky. Yeah, so then basic directions of manual evaluation. When you are designing a manual evaluation method, you need to decide what to show to the annotators, what context they should consider, and what are you asking.\nof the translations and there is no document level context so these superhuman systems produce totally unusable outputs for agreement. So this is again to highlight that depending on the setting, different results will arise. Yeah, now we are entering the part where we are trying to understand what was wrong in the MT output. So the previous evaluation was only score the system, tell me which system is better. Now we would like to learn more what is what is the output like.\npeople will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself. So we have discussed the ranking and in the ranking in that year Google won when we were considering the ties. When we were not considering the ties, when we asked the comparison to be strict so that one system is strictly better than the other, then PC translator won. So even just the little change whether you take the tie into account or not, can change the order of the systems. That is strange."

    "context": "you get the outputs, and you look at the numbers, and you run the same processing pipeline on these outputs. You cannot copy numbers from any paper because you don't know what type of tokenization they use and all that. So here are technical problems. BLEU scores are not comparable across languages. They are not comparable across different test sets. They are not comparable across different number of reference translations. They are not comparable with different implementations of the evaluation tool. There are two reasons why it's that. And they are very sensitive to tokenization.\nit's in the scale of 0 to 100 or if it's actually reasonable like 25 could be a good score. The human translation, humans against humans, is usually around 60 percent and this is many years ago phrase based system 30 and 50 for different languages these days and also it depends on the domain for some domains we are getting BLEU scores around 70 because the text is so repetitive that even like new sentences in the test set still contain large portions that were seen in the training data so it's easy to get high scores.\noutputs of the system and you ran the evaluation yourself. So there is heavy dependence on the number of references. More differences allow to match more n-grams and there is also heavy dependence on the translation direction and translation quality. So here's an example how the BLEU score correlates badly with humans. It is 2008 results and here you would like to see like a diagonal, the better the higher the BLEU score the better the human rank should be.\nand then the automatic evaluation where you implement algorithms and these algorithms somehow estimate the quality of the MT output. And if I have the time at the end I'll also briefly mention empirical confidence bounds on these scores and also the question whether you should evaluate some individual components in the system or whether you should evaluate the system end-to-end. Okay, so why is measuring of output quality in machine translation important or actually absolutely critical? Why do we put it in the very first lecture?\nMT quality is good for checking progress because you have the same setup and you are simply improving it gradually. And it is usually very bad for comparing systems of different types. I've already mentioned the problems of BLEU and we're going to discuss them in more detail now. So there is a lot of different automatic evaluation metrics. As I said, there were years and still running, years of competition. How do people like, which metric matches better the human assessments. So many metrics were created.\ntest set still contain large portions that were seen in the training data so it's easy to get high scores. Yeah BLEU score for individual sentences is not reliable. It works only reasonably well if the document is larger and more so if there is only one reference. So I've said that the original paper expects people to use four different translations as the reference, but the standard in all these competitions is to have just one. So the results are not not as reliable. So here's an illustration why it is a bad idea to use just one reference.\nand it didn't get any four-gram and any trigram. It only scored a few individual words and just two bigrams. You already see the beginning of the problem the BLEU has promoted the use of phrase based systems because they got, they were getting higher BLEU scores, they were getting the four grams correct. In that year I think PC Translator was already losing but still it was not losing by that much as the BLEU score suggests. Yeah, so one very critical thing is when you're designing any automatic evaluation metric is to avoid cheating or gaming your metric.\nto just give you the idea that the BLEU scores differ a lot. They differ because of the language difference. So here we are comparing human translation against three other human translations. So depending on which you choose the scores will vary and if you then average it the scores will also vary. And for translation into English we were getting scores like 35 or up to 50 and for the other direction English into Czech we were getting scores almost an order of magnitude lower. This is because Czech is harder, there is more words to choose from.\nnot not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation will compare machine translation outputs to some reference translation and there is also another type of automatic evaluation which doesn't require the reference, it only relies on the source and that's called quality estimation but we're not going to discuss that. So we're going to rely on the on the reference translation. The main benefit is that it is fast and cheap. So you translate the test sets once by humans, and then you can repeatedly do it.\npeople who read the sentences and still they are not confirmed by the reference. So there is a single reference. The translator decided to translate it somehow differently and for that reason the word the correct word from the MT output is not confirmed by the reference and this amounts to more than a third of the output so this is too large space where these systems can differ and some of the systems can be bad in these unconfirmed words and some can be good in these unconfirmed words so too large volume of the output is not scored, so that is where the system can differ, BLEU will not notice, and we will get lack of correlation with human judgments.\none very critical thing is when you're designing any automatic evaluation metric is to avoid cheating or gaming your metric. You want to make sure that there is no simple way to fool your metric into thinking that you're good. So one way in which the BLEU score could be cheated but it is not because it has a mechanism to avoid it is that you could be producing only reliable words so if you are translation into English, it's absolutely certain that there will be the definite article in the sentence.\ntokenization absolutely has to match, but because I didn't know it I just learned the hard way in that experiment. So the impression was that complicated methods bring more. I trust these. But the most important message was that huge jumps of the absolute BLEU scores are due to just superficial properties, the tokenization and all that. And for this reason, it is absolutely critical that when you are comparing your system with other systems, that you get the outputs, and you look at the numbers, and you run the same processing pipeline on these outputs.\nis where the system can differ, BLEU will not notice, and we will get lack of correlation with human judgments. So in a paper where I've discussed this, we have actually found out that the higher the BLEU scores themselves are, the more they correlate with humans. So if you have a higher number of matches, the reference fitted well with the MT outputs and therefore the mismatches are indicators of error. In normal case, the mismatches in one-third of cases do not indicate anything. So that's a fundamental problem.\nAnd you can also ask some more complicated questions. So here are the scoring techniques. So what are you asking. And I kind of divide those into techniques where you only consider the MT output as such so that's the blackbox method. So that's where you don't care who created the translation and how. Than some kind of grey box evaluation in which you already look at the content of the sentences from a linguistic point of view or other points of view.\nfor that. So let's look at the uni-grams only. So that is the number of words in the MT output. In total there is 35,000 of uni-grams 35,000 of words and the question is whether these words are confirmed by the reference, so what the BLEU will give a credit for them or not and whether they received a flag by humans, whether they are errors, whether they contain some error or whether they are good. So that's the two distinctions.\nof the translations and there is no document level context so these superhuman systems produce totally unusable outputs for agreement. So this is again to highlight that depending on the setting, different results will arise. Yeah, now we are entering the part where we are trying to understand what was wrong in the MT output. So the previous evaluation was only score the system, tell me which system is better. Now we would like to learn more what is what is the output like.\ndifferent implementations of the evaluation tool. There are two reasons why it's that. And they are very sensitive to tokenization. So the good thing that you can do is to rely on one fixed reference implementation and one has been done recently by a Matt Post, it's called SACREBLEU. So that's something which removes some of these problems. But there are also fundamental problems of BLEU and these fundamental problems are that BLEU is overly sensitive to word forms and sequences of tokens.\nsomething like my first experiment with BLEU cores many years ago. I was working on translation from Czech to English and I was doing some clever stuff with like corpus expansion using dependency trees and all that. And that gave me just plus 0.3 BLEU core. And then I fixed clear BLEU problems, so like, I don't know if I... Yes, I did these tricks.\nlexical choices, but it had the lowest number of missed content words. So that explains why humans preferred PC translator. So this is how the gray box style evaluation can give you a better explanation. And obviously, for me, it was a confirmation, well, you have overfitted to this automatic metric. The metric does not score all it has to score. You must not drop content words, otherwise people will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself.\nscale, and then we'll refine that in the manual evaluation and automatic evaluation. So the output can be worth reading. If you do not know the language, the source language, the machine translation would be of some use to you. It could be worth editing. So if you are a professional translator, the output will save you a lot of typing. So that's perfect. Notice that here the goal is slightly different. That already like asks for different optimization. Either preserving the core meaning or minimizing the edits necessary to bring it to a perfect output."

    "question": "Why can optimizing for BLEU lead to suboptimal MT systems?",
    "answer": "This is because the automatic evaluation metric is sensitive to many factors, such as word forms and the structure of sentences. The automatic metric focuses on the number of words in the output, rather than the meaning of each word. This can lead to the system being too focused on the word level, rather than the overall meaning of the text. Additionally, the automatic metric is sensitive to the translation direction, and can easily lead to the system being trained to output words in a specific direction. This can also cause suboptimal MT systems.",

So you translate the test sets once by humans, and then you can repeatedly do it. It's fully replicable. It's deterministic. So because it is fast and deterministic, you can even do it within some modal optimization. So this merge thing or this tuning is from the old pre-neural approaches. These days, we would do some reinforcement learning on the final scores. Usually automatic evaluation of MT quality is good for checking progress because you have the same setup and you are simply improving it gradually.\nlike to see like a diagonal, the better the higher the BLEU score the better the human rank should be. And that applies to the phrase based systems, a simple version and an improved version, but it doesn't apply to our system which is based on this deep syntax. And also to the commercial system. The commercial system did not care about n-grams, it cared about the users, so it focused on not forgetting the words, if you remember, and it scored well in the human rank and very low in the BLEU score. So that's the correlation.\nof error. In normal case, the mismatches in one-third of cases do not indicate anything. So that's a fundamental problem. So to fix this fundamental problem we can evaluate coarser units, so not exact word forms, but lemmas or deep-lemmas. We can focus on characters instead of words, so that's chrF3 or chrF3. That's something which is equally simple to the BLEU score calculation and it should be popular because it is simpler and correlates better with humans. We can also use shorter and gapy sequences.\noutputs of the system and you ran the evaluation yourself. So there is heavy dependence on the number of references. More differences allow to match more n-grams and there is also heavy dependence on the translation direction and translation quality.

And then I fixed clear BLEU problems, so like, I don't know if I... Yes, I did these tricks. I reversed the order of full stop and quote mark, and then gave him me a better improvement and then also I applied a similar tokenization to the reference and my MT output and that gave me plus 10 points. So obviously this just highlights that I was very young and stupid and I didn't know that the tokenization absolutely has to match, but because I didn't know it I just learned the hard way in that experiment.\nyou get the outputs, and you look at the numbers, and you run the same processing pipeline on these outputs. You cannot copy numbers from any paper because you don't know what type of tokenization they use and all that. So here are technical problems. BLEU scores are not comparable across languages. They are not comparable across different test sets. They are not comparable across different number of reference translations. They are not comparable with different implementations of the evaluation tool. There are two reasons why it's that. And they are very sensitive to tokenization.\nfor different optimization. Either preserving the core meaning or minimizing the edits necessary to bring it to a perfect output. And then the third stage would be worth publishing so that you could immediately publish that result and have no fear that people will laugh at you. So in general we are aiming at level one or two depending on the language pair and available data. And the level two remains and it will remain risky because the systems cannot step out of the training data, they have read more text than a human can read in a lifetime.\nso the label whether the test set is in domain or out of domain applies only to the train systems. So it applies only to the MOSES system and our tech-to-md system and PC translator was simply ran on those, so we don't know if it was in domain for PC translator or not. It is only for our systems. Yeah, so here is something like my first experiment with BLEU cores many years ago. I was working on translation from Czech to English\nsource is kind of more reliable but that slows down the process and you need bilingual people to assess that. So the best is possible to show them both but this definitely like changes the overall setting. Then there is the question of context to consider and for many years people in machine translation field focus only on the sentence level. So machine translation systems these days operate on the level of sentences. If you shuffle the sentences you get the same outputs.\nconsider all of them, it will seem that the standard BLEU score correlates almost perfectly with that 0.99 or something. That's the SACREBLEU is this line the violet line the other lines are other metrics that take part in the competition. So one of the metrics is very bad, like it's always under zero. This one is also like pretty bad. Most of the metrics seem to correlate very well, but if you reduce the set of systems, and you take only the top eight systems, then suddenly you are around zero, so there's no correlation.\nlexical choices, but it had the lowest number of missed content words. So that explains why humans preferred PC translator. So this is how the gray box style evaluation can give you a better explanation. And obviously, for me, it was a confirmation, well, you have overfitted to this automatic metric. The metric does not score all it has to score. You must not drop content words, otherwise people will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself."

    "question": "What is the difference between black-box, gray-box, and glass-box evaluation?",
    "answer": "The difference between black-box, gray-box, and glass-box evaluation is the level of access to the system's inner working. In a black-box evaluation, the system's inner workings are hidden from the evaluator, and the evaluator only has access to the output. In a gray-box evaluation, the evaluator has access to the system's source code and configuration settings, but is not allowed to examine the system's inner workings. In a glass-box evaluation, the evaluator has access to both the system's source code and configuration settings, but is not allowed to examine the system's inner workings.",
    "context": "repeatedly at all and we have already seen that the experiment design is absolutely critical. You will learn different results. The black box evaluation is important for users or sponsors who just want to know who is the best and full stop but the more fine-grained gray or glass box evaluation is important for us developers. We know which aspect of the system is wrong and what should we focus on. And then the source-based evaluation allows to compare with humans, so there we can check whether in the evaluated aspect we are on par with humans or not.\ninterested in knowing which component fails, doesn't do its job properly, and that would be kind of glass box evaluation. So you're checking how far this information from the source got actually in the system and where it was lost in the processing. As you see, most of effort is being devoted to the black box methods and that's because you can apply these methods to all the systems.\nyou already look at the content of the sentences from a linguistic point of view or other points of view. And you are trying to figure out what error types are there, which may be important for some particular applications. So some applications may be sensitive to grammar errors, some may be sensitive to negation drop and other things. So that's a gray box. And then if you are an author of the system, you are most interested in knowing which component fails, doesn't do its job properly, and that would be kind of glass box evaluation.\nlexical choices, but it had the lowest number of missed content words. So that explains why humans preferred PC translator. So this is how the gray box style evaluation can give you a better explanation.

There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself.\ntell me which system is better. Now we would like to learn more what is what is the output like. So one evaluation was called HMENT and it was checking whether the basic even structure was understandable. And I will only highlight it. I'll illustrate how it works. So you have the candidate A and then the reference translation. So the reference translation says the referee Wolfgang Stark then garnered some attention and the two candidates are finally he stood in the center of the referee Wolfgang Stark. That doesn't make much sense.\nis being devoted to the black box methods and that's because you can apply these methods to all the systems. So there is regular competitions in machine translation, the WMT task, and that has, aside from competing in machine translation, also had a track on competing in or internally, like, competes, like how do we evaluate how do we find the winner. And that's where a lot of insight comes from. So the two classical measures of evaluating translation is checking the adequacy and fluency. These two scales are also correlated.\nAnd you can also ask some more complicated questions. So here are the scoring techniques. So what are you asking. And I kind of divide those into techniques where you only consider the MT output as such so that's the blackbox method. So that's where you don't care who created the translation and how. Than some kind of grey box evaluation in which you already look at the content of the sentences from a linguistic point of view or other points of view.\nwas actually our deep syntactic system which preserve the meaning of the sentences for the purposes of this testing best. So different evaluation methods, and most of them are manual evaluation methods, they will give you different results. So that's why I'm always highlighting the friendly competition and not the competition competition, not who is going to win, but who has the lowest number of errors of a particular type aspect.\npeople will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself. So we have discussed the ranking and in the ranking in that year Google won when we were considering the ties. When we were not considering the ties, when we asked the comparison to be strict so that one system is strictly better than the other, then PC translator won. So even just the little change whether you take the tie into account or not, can change the order of the systems. That is strange.\nMT quality is good for checking progress because you have the same setup and you are simply improving it gradually. And it is usually very bad for comparing systems of different types. I've already mentioned the problems of BLEU and we're going to discuss them in more detail now. So there is a lot of different automatic evaluation metrics. As I said, there were years and still running, years of competition. How do people like, which metric matches better the human assessments. So many metrics were created.\nhave access to anything else, only to the system output. So that's the, that's the computation. Here is another thing. I've talked about the task-based evaluation, so giving people instructions translated by machine and checking whether they do what they are supposed to do. We made a simplification of that. We asked them to answer a quiz-like questions. So we prepared English texts.\nB took part in six competitions, and it was better in four of them. Sometimes the score is the same. So E took part in one screen and won. It took part in three pairwise comparisons and won of all of those. So here the score would be 100% for all cases. But in some cases the results will differ. So in the simulated pairwise, B seems better because it was better than in more pairs, whereas A won more screens, so to say.\nthe same for all the screens, for each of these screens. Then you have a large number of pairwise comparisons. So this is a way to get larger statistics, larger numbers, so that this evaluation is more stable because it is based on more numbers. And then you evaluate in these pairwise comparisons how often the system was better than its competitors. A took part in six pairwise comparisons, and in three of them it was the better one. And B took part in six competitions, and it was better in four of them. Sometimes the score is the same.\nnot not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation will compare machine translation outputs to some reference translation and there is also another type of automatic evaluation which doesn't require the reference, it only relies on the source and that's called quality estimation but we're not going to discuss that.

So you translate the test sets once by humans, and then you can repeatedly do it.\npairwise, B seems better because it was better than in more pairs, whereas A won more screens, so to say. So I'm showing this again to highlight that the actual calculation of the score can affect what you will get as the end result. And the eye tracking was also performed with the idea in mind, maybe when people are shown five systems at once, we should not interpret these five scores as pairwise comparisons. If they don't do pairwise comparisons, these pairwise comparisons can be unreliable.\ntokenization absolutely has to match, but because I didn't know it I just learned the hard way in that experiment. So the impression was that complicated methods bring more. I trust these. But the most important message was that huge jumps of the absolute BLEU scores are due to just superficial properties, the tokenization and all that.

So the previous evaluation was only score the system, tell me which system is better. Now we would like to learn more what is what is the output like.\nlow quality for a language that you don't speak works so well, if you have the context what's the question. If you know what you are after, you will find it even in some very badly translated output. So that's an approximation of the task evaluation. Here is another way of scoring. This is the GCSE style of evaluation, the maturita in Czech. So we were checking this year how the best systems translate audit reports. It was auditors who assess them, and they use scores similar to what students are tested on when they write their essays for GCSE.\nthe properties and the problems. It's within the range of 0 and 1. It's often written as 0 to 100. So if you see a black score of 0.25, you don't know whether the system is totally crappy because it's in the scale of 0 to 100 or if it's actually reasonable like 25 could be a good score."

It is obviously the results will differ across judges, but the results will also differ for a single person. If you ask the same person twice, they will give you a different answer because they will notice another part of the sentence and give you a different score. It is not reproducible.\nnot so good in statistical tests but I'm afraid some of these statistics can also be skewed by this change. So here is the results from this pseudo-document-aware evaluation. So from the last evaluation campaign in English to Czech, the system from 2018 was now significantly worse than humans and it was on par with some system which tried to handle the document context as well. And what else? Well, having said this it is also important to realize that every year it is new texts.\nanswer because they will notice another part of the sentence and give you a different score. It is not reproducible. That's the hardest problem of manual evaluation because as soon as an annotator has read a sentence they will remember it even if you give it to them in a week they will still be biased by that. So you cannot do this repeatedly at all and we have already seen that the experiment design is absolutely critical. You will learn different results.\ncompetition, not who is going to win, but who has the lowest number of errors of a particular type aspect. This year in 2019 we have seen that the best systems match humans in the GCSE style scoring but they score worse in the pseudo document or direct assessments and they are absolutely terrible when translating agreements. So again we have different outcomes based on the manual evaluation. So we are summarizing, finally we are summarizing manual evaluation. It is expensive in terms of money. It is subjective, so different judges can guess more.\nmethods and the automatic methods, and I've told you that the automatic methods are designed to correlate well with humans. So I'm gonna now totally blow it up with saying that it is difficult, that this correlation with humans is not something very stable. So the correlation of an automatic metric with the human judgment depends on the underlying set of systems. So this is English to German translation where there are 20 systems. If you consider all of them, it will seem that the standard BLEU score correlates almost perfectly with that 0.99 or something.\nyou get the outputs, and you look at the numbers, and you run the same processing pipeline on these outputs. You cannot copy numbers from any paper because you don't know what type of tokenization they use and all that. So here are technical problems. BLEU scores are not comparable across languages. They are not comparable across different test sets. They are not comparable across different number of reference translations. They are not comparable with different implementations of the evaluation tool. There are two reasons why it's that. And they are very sensitive to tokenization.\ntell me which system is better. Now we would like to learn more what is what is the output like. So one evaluation was called HMENT and it was checking whether the basic even structure was understandable. And I will only highlight it. I'll illustrate how it works. So you have the candidate A and then the reference translation. So the reference translation says the referee Wolfgang Stark then garnered some attention and the two candidates are finally he stood in the center of the referee Wolfgang Stark. That doesn't make much sense.\nwith humans, so there we can check whether in the evaluated aspect we are on par with humans or not. And the sentence level is no longer relevant for any language pair where there is enough large enough training data. So the sentence level is going to happened on for languages where we have sufficient resources and good enough systems because, well, that was the 2018 result, beating humans at the level of sentences, but not not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation.\ncannot step out of the training data, they have read more text than a human can read in a lifetime. So there is a little chance that they could avoid like stupid pitfalls, but still it's uncertain because they don't understand what is the message and who is the intended audience of that message and so on. So it remains risky. Yeah, so then basic directions of manual evaluation. When you are designing a manual evaluation method, you need to decide what to show to the annotators, what context they should consider, and what are you asking.\ntokenization absolutely has to match, but because I didn't know it I just learned the hard way in that experiment. So the impression was that complicated methods bring more. I trust these. But the most important message was that huge jumps of the absolute BLEU scores are due to just superficial properties, the tokenization and all that. And for this reason, it is absolutely critical that when you are comparing your system with other systems, that you get the outputs, and you look at the numbers, and you run the same processing pipeline on these outputs.\ndifferent implementations of the evaluation tool. There are two reasons why it's that. And they are very sensitive to tokenization. So the good thing that you can do is to rely on one fixed reference implementation and one has been done recently by a Matt Post, it's called SACREBLEU. So that's something which removes some of these problems. But there are also fundamental problems of BLEU and these fundamental problems are that BLEU is overly sensitive to word forms and sequences of tokens.\nand then the automatic evaluation where you implement algorithms and these algorithms somehow estimate the quality of the MT output. And if I have the time at the end I'll also briefly mention empirical confidence bounds on these scores and also the question whether you should evaluate some individual components in the system or whether you should evaluate the system end-to-end. Okay, so why is measuring of output quality in machine translation important or actually absolutely critical? Why do we put it in the very first lecture?\nyou can also include the reference translation in the evaluation because you do not need it. It's not reference based. So that's it, but still it was It is always complicated to run these evaluations, so it was not run on large scale and never tested in in a big run. And I'm showing these because we're in Prague and while in Prague we must not forget tectogrammatics, the deep representation of the sentence, deep syntactic. And it is very close to what H. Mann and Hume do.\nis being devoted to the black box methods and that's because you can apply these methods to all the systems. So there is regular competitions in machine translation, the WMT task, and that has, aside from competing in machine translation, also had a track on competing in or internally, like, competes, like how do we evaluate how do we find the winner. And that's where a lot of insight comes from. So the two classical measures of evaluating translation is checking the adequacy and fluency. These two scales are also correlated.\nthat we are going to evaluate the whole document. So it's absolutely inevitable that these two documents will be incomparable. I would say. So when people are still doing the sentence level evaluation, they deemed a sentence is maybe too long unit to compare, so they also tried doing relative ranking of just a part of a sentence. So here you are given the whole sentence content, but you are assessing only the highlighted phrase."

    "question": "What does the lecture suggest about the role of context in evaluating MT outputs?",
    "answer": "The context in evaluating MT outputs is important. The context helps to understand the output even if it is incomplete.",
    "context": "and then the automatic evaluation where you implement algorithms and these algorithms somehow estimate the quality of the MT output. And if I have the time at the end I'll also briefly mention empirical confidence bounds on these scores and also the question whether you should evaluate some individual components in the system or whether you should evaluate the system end-to-end. Okay, so why is measuring of output quality in machine translation important or actually absolutely critical? Why do we put it in the very first lecture?\none cared about document level context in 2018. Like we knew that it is important, but we had other problems. And the evaluation was also done at the level of individual segments. So here is the benefit that the MT got. The sentences when judged without the context can seem more natural if they were created without the context. But if you evaluate the sentence in the proper context of the document, then suddenly I'm quite confident that the human scores would be higher.\nof the translations and there is no document level context so these superhuman systems produce totally unusable outputs for agreement. So this is again to highlight that depending on the setting, different results will arise. Yeah, now we are entering the part where we are trying to understand what was wrong in the MT output. So the previous evaluation was only score the system, tell me which system is better. Now we would like to learn more what is what is the output like.\nsource is kind of more reliable but that slows down the process and you need bilingual people to assess that. So the best is possible to show them both but this definitely like changes the overall setting. Then there is the question of context to consider and for many years people in machine translation field focus only on the sentence level. So machine translation systems these days operate on the level of sentences. If you shuffle the sentences you get the same outputs.\nGood morning, welcome to the class on statistical machine translation. The first lecture is on evaluating machine translation quality. First, I'd like to give you a very rough overview of what is going to happen in this semester. So this is the course outline. As you see, we start at the end. We will discuss the evaluation first and you will learn very quickly why evaluation is so important for all the research that you are doing. And then, in the next lecture, we will discuss the overview of various approaches to machine translation.\nnot not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation will compare machine translation outputs to some reference translation and there is also another type of automatic evaluation which doesn't require the reference, it only relies on the source and that's called quality estimation but we're not going to discuss that. So we're going to rely on the on the reference translation. The main benefit is that it is fast and cheap. So you translate the test sets once by humans, and then you can repeatedly do it.\ncan be kind of mocked, simulated, faked by just clever copy-pasting and adjusting pieces of texts that humans previously translated. So one of the last lectures towards the end of the semester is also going to be devoted to the question of meaning, how much the systems actually internally kind of understand, whatever it means, and whether the neural MT is making this understanding more accessible or actually less accessible. So we'll discuss that later on. And I'm again highlighting the last point.\nunderstanding more accessible or actually less accessible. So we'll discuss that later on. And I'm again highlighting the last point. At the very end of the semester your projects will be presented and that's the cornerstone of this seminar. So it's not only the lectures but it will be also your research work. So now for today I'm going to talk about machine translation evaluation and for that we first need to very briefly summarize what is the task of machine translation for us and then we'll go over\nto focus on that. So this is something we cannot do with the Turkers. So what was in the past? And let's quickly discuss this because there was a period of 80 years of WMT evaluation where some other simplification was used and it's called the relative ranking. So in the relative ranking, you run by sentences and you are showing the source, the reference, and you are showing five outputs of MT systems. Possibly there could be human output as well, but you would have to pay twice for the test set translation because you would have to...\nof a sentence. So here you are given the whole sentence content, but you are assessing only the highlighted phrase. So that gives you some simplification for the annotators, but again you are not evaluating even the whole sentence, so maybe the verb is lost, this method will not notice. So here is a little intermezzo. If you have these scores, how do you get the winner of the MT system?\nfirst need to very briefly summarize what is the task of machine translation for us and then we'll go over well maybe two high number of evaluation methods and they are grossly divided into manual evaluation methods where you need humans annotators or assessors and then the automatic evaluation where you implement algorithms and these algorithms somehow estimate the quality of the MT output.\npeople who read the sentences and still they are not confirmed by the reference. So there is a single reference. The translator decided to translate it somehow differently and for that reason the word the correct word from the MT output is not confirmed by the reference and this amounts to more than a third of the output so this is too large space where these systems can differ and some of the systems can be bad in these unconfirmed words and some can be good in these unconfirmed words so too large volume of the output is not scored, so that is where the system can differ, BLEU will not notice, and we will get lack of correlation with human judgments.\nlexical choices, but it had the lowest number of missed content words. So that explains why humans preferred PC translator. So this is how the gray box style evaluation can give you a better explanation. And obviously, for me, it was a confirmation, well, you have overfitted to this automatic metric. The metric does not score all it has to score. You must not drop content words, otherwise people will not like your outputs. So this was one particular contradiction. There is also contradictions in manual evaluation itself.\nAnd you can also ask some more complicated questions. So here are the scoring techniques. So what are you asking. And I kind of divide those into techniques where you only consider the MT output as such so that's the blackbox method. So that's where you don't care who created the translation and how. Than some kind of grey box evaluation in which you already look at the content of the sentences from a linguistic point of view or other points of view.\nMT quality is good for checking progress because you have the same setup and you are simply improving it gradually. And it is usually very bad for comparing systems of different types. I've already mentioned the problems of BLEU and we're going to discuss them in more detail now. So there is a lot of different automatic evaluation metrics. As I said, there were years and still running, years of competition. How do people like, which metric matches better the human assessments. So many metrics were created.\nis being devoted to the black box methods and that's because you can apply these methods to all the systems. So there is regular competitions in machine translation, the WMT task, and that has, aside from competing in machine translation, also had a track on competing in or internally, like, competes, like how do we evaluate how do we find the winner. And that's where a lot of insight comes from. So the two classical measures of evaluating translation is checking the adequacy and fluency. These two scales are also correlated.\nfor that. So let's look at the uni-grams only. So that is the number of words in the MT output. In total there is 35,000 of uni-grams 35,000 of words and the question is whether these words are confirmed by the reference, so what the BLEU will give a credit for them or not and whether they received a flag by humans, whether they are errors, whether they contain some error or whether they are good. So that's the two distinctions.\nwith humans, so there we can check whether in the evaluated aspect we are on par with humans or not. And the sentence level is no longer relevant for any language pair where there is enough large enough training data. So the sentence level is going to happened on for languages where we have sufficient resources and good enough systems because, well, that was the 2018 result, beating humans at the level of sentences, but not not in the full context. So the big area that I would like to cover now is automatic evaluation.\ncannot step out of the training data, they have read more text than a human can read in a lifetime. So there is a little chance that they could avoid like stupid pitfalls, but still it's uncertain because they don't understand what is the message and who is the intended audience of that message and so on. So it remains risky. Yeah, so then basic directions of manual evaluation. When you are designing a manual evaluation method, you need to decide what to show to the annotators, what context they should consider, and what are you asking.\nhere is a little intermezzo. If you have these scores, how do you get the winner of the MT system? And the main message from this is whatever field you are working in, whatever evaluation method is established there, you need to very carefully see what is behind the scenes and what is actually being done. So when interpreting these middle ranks, what you are getting from people is these screens of annotations or we can maybe call them blocks. This block of annotation is the dots where you put them. I've simplified it."
