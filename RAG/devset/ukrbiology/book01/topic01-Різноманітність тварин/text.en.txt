Topic 1
Animal diversity
In this topic, you will study the main groups of animals, defining
features of their structure and biological characteristics. You will learn how
how they adapted to exist in a certain environment, as
interact with each other and what role they play in nature.
In addition, you will understand how closely related a person's interests are
with each species of animal. Each species, each group of animals has its own
role in the life of our planet. If it seems to us that some animals
do not play any role in our lives, it only means that
We still don't know them very well.
Throughout the study of the topic, you will explore the life of the
edges of seas and oceans, soil organisms, land-air
animals and those who have chosen other creatures as their habitat.

5 Classification and significance of animals
Famous ancient Greek scientist Aristotle
in the 4th century BC divided living organisms into two large
kingdoms — Plants and Animals. And why do we even

animals? What are the benefits or harms of them? Let's try
to figure it out.
Dividing animals into groups. How was it?
People have always understood that there are many different animals. Even
In the times of primitive society they were divided into groups. Now we call them
We call this division a classification. The first classifications were very
simple: these animals can be eaten, and these cannot. So there are two groups - edible
edible and inedible animals. Or you can divide animals in a completely different way:
those that hunt humans (e.g. tigers), those on which humans
hunts itself (for example, hares), and those that do not fall into the first two
groups (for example, the cross spider).
Over time, new classifications began to appear. And with this
a problem of misunderstanding arose between scientists from different countries. As between
to agree with each other, if, for example, the word "frog" in Ukrainian
and Russian languages denote completely different animals? That is why the
efforts were made to find a common language and develop classification rules.
To avoid confusion, it was agreed to give all names in Latin.
modern classification of animals
The basis of any classification in biology is the species. A species is a group of
a group of animals that has a common origin, the same structure, and occupies
a specific habitat. Each animal belongs to a specific species.
The scientific name of a species consists of two words. The full name is written
in Latin, and for convenience in each country it is translated into the local
language (Fig. 5.1).
Species should not be confused with breed. Breeds are formed as a result of the activity
of a person who creates them for his own purposes, and are not different species. Yes, different breeds
Dogs belong to one species - the domestic dog.

Carl von Linnaeus (1707–1778) was a prominent Swedish biologist,
professor at Uppsala University. The main focus of the study is
devoted his time to the systematics of living organisms. He is the author of
modern classification of plants and animals, in which each species
corresponds to the Latin name of two words. Linnaeus described many
species of plants and animals.
In turn, classes are grouped into types. The Chord type, for example,
consists of the classes Mammals, Reptiles, Birds, etc. And to the type Member-
The classes Insecta and Crustacea belong to the class of arthropods. Finally,

How can you classify an animal into a specific group?
To do this, scientists study it in detail. They take into account the peculiarities of
those of external and internal structure, distribution area and features

Polyps and jellyfish
Intestinal worms can be divided into polyps and jellyfish. Polyps

colonies to hunt together and defend themselves from enemies.
Jellyfish lead a more mobile lifestyle. Their body is shaped like a

water from inside their "bell" and move in the opposite direction from the
direct water jet to the side.

Living environment
Insects can be found everywhere - in forests, fields, caves, soil,
rivers, lakes, etc. Some have even adapted to life in the seas,
although there are few of them. However, sea water meters can be seen
on the ocean surface very far from the shore.
Some insects have adapted to living alongside humans,
example, cockroaches and bed bugs. Moving after her,
they populated our entire planet.
What do they eat and who eats them?
Insects eat everything, and everyone eats them. It is difficult to find any more or less

Types of insect development
There are over 1 million species of insects in the world. They are divided into
are divided into two large groups according to the type of post-embryonic
development. These are insects with complete and incomplete metamorphosis.
Each of these groups has its own advantages and
disadvantages. But this did not prevent them from being quite successful in
to populate the entire planet.
Developmental features with incomplete transformation
(without metamorphosis)
The development of insects with incomplete metamorphosis begins with the
laying a fertilized egg (Fig. 11.1). For a certain time, the insect
wriggles in the egg and then emerges from it. The larva that emerged
from the egg, outwardly similar to the adult (Fig. 11.2), only has smaller
size. In addition, it has underdeveloped wings and does not function
gonads, meaning it cannot reproduce.
The larva constantly eats and gradually grows. Due to the fact that

The embryo is a stationary stage of development. Inside it, most of the tissues
and cells dissolve and serve as a source of nutrition for a few
cells that form the body of an adult insect. After the formation of the adult
body logo insect emerges from the pupa already capable of reproduction
(in the form of an adult) (Fig. 11.4).
Advantages and disadvantages of development with complete transformation
The advantage of development with complete transformation is that adults
individuals and larvae feed on different foods (Fig. 11.5). This reduces
competition between individuals of a species that can live on the same
area, and increases their number.
The disadvantage is that for the larva to turn into an adult
requires a stationary stage that may be vulnerable to predators.

to have many specific structural features that are unique to them.
Adaptations in body structure to parasitism

Eggs are exposed to adverse factors both in the host's body,
as well as in the external environment.
The life cycle of a parasite is not always complex, but it is always

Diversity of parasites
Parasites can be found in any group of living organisms.
They are found both among worms (roundworms) and among arthropods (ticks, lice),
and among vertebrates (hyxins, vampire bats) (Fig. 15.3). Even

The name reptiles comes from their way of moving.

and turtles.

Reptiles live in all environments. There are aquatic and terrestrial species.
Some of these animals live in trees (Figure 21.1). Among the extinct
Among the representatives of reptiles, there were also flying forms. Of the modern reptiles,
However, only a few can perform gliding flight (Figure 21.2).
Most reptiles live in warm countries. They are especially abundant in
tropics. Closer to the polar regions, the number of reptile species
significantly decreases.
What do they eat and who eats them?
Most reptiles are carnivores. Some lizards (e.g.,
iguanas) are omnivorous. Only exclusively or almost exclusively herbivorous are
land turtles.
Reptiles can be preyed upon by birds, mammals, and other reptiles.
Representatives of aquatic reptile species are eaten by fish, in particular sharks.

Departments and coverings of the body
The body of mammals consists of a head, a long neck, a trunk, and limbs.
(Fig. 26.5). Their limbs, unlike those of reptiles,
located under the torso, which ensures perfect and fast movements.
The skin of mammals has a complex structure. It contains nerve endings
receptors, sweat, sebaceous, and odorous glands. Derivatives of the skin
are hair, nails, claws, horns, and hooves. Hair, or wool, serves
mostly for warmth, like the down feathers of birds. Long
The hairs on the muzzle, belly, and limbs of mammals are called vibrissae,
they help to perceive space.
