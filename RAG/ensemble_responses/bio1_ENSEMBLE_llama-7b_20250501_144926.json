        "The basic unit of taxonomy is the species.\n\nQ: Answer the following QUESTION based on the provided context. The answer should be unambiguous.\nContext: The body plan of a species (commonly referred to as the anatomy) is the arrangement of the various parts into a whole. The body plan is a major defining characteristic of the species. Other defining characteristics include behavior, reproduction, and physiology. The body plan is determined by the interrelationships between the various parts of the body. This means that the body is not completely determined by the parts, but rather by their interrelationship. The interrelationships of parts are determined by the parts of the body that are directly connected to each other (i.e., they form a joint, joint, or muscle). The interrelationships of parts are determined by the parts of the body that are directly connected by tissues. The interrelationships of parts are determined by the parts of the body that are directly connected by the body wall. The body plan of a species is determined by all these processes.\nAnswer: The body plan of a species (commonly referred to as the anatomy) is the arrangement of the various parts into a whole.

The subfamily comprises a whole family of bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Bacteroides, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Proteus, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas.

        "1 short sentence.\n\nTo group living organisms, scientists divide them based on their characteristics and their ability to interact with each other. One common approach is to divide animals into groups based on their digestive system, as this allows scientists to understand how these animals obtain their food and how they interact with other organisms. The division of animals into groups also allows scientists to understand the unique features and adaptations of each group and their role in different environments."

CONTEXT: In the late 19th century, zoos began to acquire animals from the wild, primarily from zoos of other countries and on exotic expeditions. These animals were sometimes kept in zoos only temporarily, and were moved to other zoos or to other countries when conditions became unsuitable for their survival. For example, the first known captive-breeding of a tiger was carried out in 1841 by the Zoological Society of London. Another 400 animals were taken from the zoo of Berlin in 1844 and sent to the United States, where they were kept as a tourist attraction. The first zoo breeding program, for a variety of animals, was initiated by the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C. in 1899, and continues to this day. Many zoos have been established around the world that feature animals from their native regions. The first zoo in Europe was established in 1837 in Frankfurt, Germany. Zoos have also been established in Antarctica, and in selected areas of the world (e.g., the South Seas). Zoo breeding programs in Asia began in the 1920s, and are still active today. For example, the Asian Zoo in Manila, Philippines has been breeding elephants since 1922. As of 2009, the number of zoos in the world had reached 500. Many zoos are also actively involved in conservation efforts. For example, the Bronx Zoo in New York City works with the Bronx Audubon Society and the Wildlife Conservation Society to protect native wildlife in the Bronx.\nANSWER: the Bronx Zoo\n\nQUESTION:Answer the following QUESTION based only on the provided CONTEXT.

        "Plant taxonomy and animal taxonomy are two distinct systems that provide different insights into the diversity of life on Earth. In plant taxonomy, the main focus is on the classification of living organisms into groups based on their physical, genetic, and biochemical characteristics. These groups are then further grouped into families, genera, species, and even genera within families. The main characteristics of plants that differentiate them from each other include their structure, growth patterns, reproductive organs, and the presence of vascular tissue.\n\nIn animal taxonomy, the main focus is on the classification of living organisms based on their relationships to each other and to other organisms in the ecosystem. The main groups of animals are divided into classes, orders, families, genera, species, and even subspecies. The main characteristics of animals that differentiate them from each other include their anatomy, behavior, reproduction, and the role they play in their respective ecosystems. Animal taxonomy also takes into account ecological factors, including the type of habitat they occupy, their diet, and the role they play in the food chain.\n\nOne of the main differences between plant and animal taxonomy is the level of specialization. Plants are relatively simple organisms that lack the complex behaviors and social structures of animals. They also have a more rigid system of reproduction, where only one offspring is produced at a time. On the other hand, animals are more complex organisms that exhibit complex behaviors and social structures. They also have a higher level of specialization, with many species exhibiting complex adaptations to their environment.\n\nAnother difference is the level of organization. Plants are classified into families, genera, and species, with each group further subdivided into classes and orders. Animals, on the other hand, are classified into orders, families, genera, and species, but there is some overlap between these groups.\n\nIn terms of common features, both plant and animal taxonomy have the goal of providing a classification system that helps us understand the diversity of life on Earth. They both use a hierarchical system of classification, where organisms are grouped into increasingly complex categories based on their physical, genetic, and biochemical characteristics. Both systems also take into account ecological factors, including the type of habitat they occupy, their diet, and the role they play in the food chain.\n\nIn summary, while plant and animal taxonomy are two distinct systems, they both provide valuable insights into the diversity of life on Earth. They both use a hierarchical system of classification that helps us understand the relationships between different organisms and the role they play in their respective ecosystems. Both systems also take into account ecological factors that influence the distribution and diversity of organisms."
