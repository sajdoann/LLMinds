So I'm going to give you some examples of evaluation methods that are not based on the MT output. So let's review a few of them.\nI'll give you a short list of the three methods for this particular topic. The first is the automatic evaluation, which is based on the MT output. Now let's say we have the automatic evaluation, which involves the evaluation of the sentence. Now the second is the hybrid evaluation. I call it the hybrid evaluation. Here I'm going to say that the hybrid evaluation is the evaluation from the sentence-level, and the real MT output. So the hybrid evaluation, that is the evaluation from the sentence-level. And also here I'm going to say that the hybrid evaluation is the evaluation from the input-level. So I'm going to say that the hybrid evaluation is about the sentence-level, so the hybrid evaluation will be the evaluation from the input-level.\n\nANSWER: So that's the hybrid",

One of the best things about manual evaluation is that it is often the case that you are evaluating both systems. You can make a mistake and you may have to give up on things. But there are two problems that I would like to have a solution",
        "adequacy and fluency in manual evaluation are related by the fact that fluency is related to adequacy (or fluency is related to adequacy). However, fluency is not the sole criterion for evaluating the correctness of a translation, as it can be improved with a more fluent sentence. The criteria for evaluating fluency include spelling, typography, and style. The accuracy of a machine translation is measured by checking for omission or mistranslation and addition. The accuracy of a machine translation can be lowered by using automatic evaluation methods, which do not consider fluency.\n\nThe goal of machine translation is to provide a machine-generated translation of the source text that is as closely accurate as possible to the original text. It is important to evaluate the accuracy of the machine translation to ensure that the output is reliable and understandable to the intended audience. However, it is equally important to evaluate the quality of the machine translation in terms of fluency to ensure that the output is grammatically correct and understandable."

      "question": "What does the lecture suggest about the role of context in evaluating MT outputs?",
      "final_answer": "According to the lecture, context is crucial in evaluating MT outputs. The lecture highlights that when judging MT outputs without context, they may seem more natural, but when evaluated in the proper context of the document, the human scores would be higher. This suggests that context can significantly impact the quality of MT outputs and that evaluating them in isolation may not accurately reflect their quality.",

        "It is not about context. It is about evaluation. So the MT outputs are the evaluation of the MT output and not the evaluation of the sentence. So the MT output is a kind of evaluation of the MT output but it can also be used for any translation system not only for the MT output but also for any translation system for the MT output, as well as for any translation system for the MT output. And the MT outputs are a kind of evaluation of the MT output but they can also be used for any translation system for any MT output that uses the MT output. So the MT output is just the output and not the sentence.\n\nANSWER: So what is the context in the lecture? And what is the context in the lecture?\n\nCONTEXT: If the sentence is not used as the evaluation of the MT output, then the MT",
        "There is a benefit that the MT got.\n\nQUESTION:What is the main benefit of using automatic evaluation of MT outputs?\nANSWER: It's fast and cheap."
