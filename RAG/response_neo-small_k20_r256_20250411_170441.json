    "answer": "Vaccination is a powerful weapon in our fight against monsters that many of us have already forgotten. The biggest side effects of vaccinations are a reduction in the number of dead children. And an allergic reaction that can lead to permanent hearing loss. And the worst side effect of measles is Encephalitis. So if we vaccinate 10,000,000 children, a total of 120 of them will have more serious side effects. Up to 100 or 0.001% may have a serious allergic reaction that needs to be treated. Up to 10 children or 0.0001%, may have the worst side effect: Encephalitis."

    "context": "What are the weapons of immunity against infection?",
    "answer": "The most effective immune system is the immune system that works by the most. The immune system that controls the body's defences takes in the most. It is a powerful tool because it works by controlling an immune response to a disease. It's because of the immune system's ability to fight off the infection. It is also because the immune system takes in the most. It is a powerful tool because it is the most powerful in the fight against a disease. It is not only the most powerful weapon, but also the most effective in the fight against infection."
