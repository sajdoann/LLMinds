      "answer": "TRUE.\n\nEXPLANATION: The text states that the speaker leaned over to the Prime Minister and asked if the oil was pure or crude, and the Prime Minister was unsure. The speaker then admits to making a mistake and apologizing for it. Based on this information, it can be determined that the speaker's initial statement was incorrect, and therefore the answer is TRUE."

Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The Ministry of the Interior also commented on the draft Building Act in its <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNBK2CPYTM\">analysis</a> (.pdf). In her statement, Minister Dostálová criticizes the estimates of the Ministry of the Interior, which estimated one-time costs at CZK 2.2—31.6 billion (p. 4). The part of securing space for new regional building offices and the <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/pripominky-k-stavebnimu-zakonu-muze-mmr-resit-do-konce-brezna/1838883\">planned</a> Supreme Building Office is mainly criticized.</p><p> The Ministry of the Interior states in the introduction to the section <em>on Premises</em> (p. 32) that the draft law “(...) <em>currently assumes an optimistic scenario where municipalities and regions will provide the state with their current premises. This expectation is unrealistic; the capacity of municipalities and regions will not be made available, as it would bring extraordinary problems in the area of IT, operation, sharing of services (e.g. the registry office) or working in a different regime (the Act on Civil Servants vs. the Civil Service Act). In the event of delimitation, it will be necessary to provide premises.</em> ”<em> </em>Estimates for securing premises by renting are around CZK 425 million per year. The Ministry further notes that “ <em>(...) it is not possible to solve the delimitation by renting everywhere, as no suitable premises are available at all in certain locations.</em> ”<em> </em>(p. 33)</p><p> The chapter dedicated to Construction (pp. 33—34) then states that &quot; <em>The maximalist variant assumes that new premises would be built for all existing officials of building authorities, integrated affected bodies and new service personnel. This includes 13,584 employees in total. Construction expenses would reach at least 25.4 billion crowns in the maximalist variant.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(p. 34). To these costs it would be necessary to add the costs of building archives for storing documentation. These costs are around CZK 3.5 billion. In total, the Ministry of the Interior estimates the construction in the most expensive possible version at CZK 28.9 billion.<br/><br/> Minister Dostálová falsely stated that &quot; <em>(...) the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior does not state that the state currently pays municipalities for the officials who handle construction procedures&quot;</em> . The chapter Financing the Agenda in the analysis deals with this entire issue.<em> </em>(p. 36), which details the current financing of the agenda of building authorities, spatial planning and partly also the affected authorities, which are currently financed through a contribution to the performance of state administration (pursuant to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-128#p62-1\">Section 62 of Act No. 128/2000 Coll., on municipalities</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-129#p29-2\">Section 29(2) of Act No. 129/2000 Coll., on regions</a> ).</p><p> The procedures for determining the amount of the contribution for the performance of state administration for 2020 are listed in <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-355#f6688621\">the annex to</a> Act No. 355/2019 on the State Budget of the Czech Republic for 2020. The individual contribution amounts for specific municipalities can also be clearly found on <a href=\"https://www.prispevekobce.cz/\">the website</a> of the Ministry of the Interior.</p><p> The Ministry of the Interior further <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNBK2CPYTM\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 38) that the total real costs (including overheads) for the agenda of building authorities and land planning authorities at the municipal and regional levels amount to almost 4.6 billion CZK, of which 4.2 billion CZK are spent on municipalities. However, in reality, only 2.3 billion CZK is spent on the state budget through contributions to municipalities and regions. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the real overhead costs amount to 1.1 billion CZK.</p><p> Although the probability of constructing new buildings for all planned employees of new building authorities is unknown, we assess the statement as false, because the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior also addresses the issue of financing building authorities through contributions for the performance of state administration, the amount of which differs from those mentioned in Minister Dostálová&#39;s statement.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

Aren&#39;t you abandoning the values on which TOP 09 stands? Pospíšil: First of all, it must be said that I have never praised Babiš for this. This distortion was brought by Parlamentní listy.\nSECTION B: This is the second part (EU x UK agreements, note: Demagog.cz), where it is clearly stated that citizens of the European Union who still live in Great Britain and who move there by March next year and perhaps even until the end of the transition period (...) will have the same rights as they would have had if Great Britain were in the European Union (...).\nSECTION C: This (the second part of the EU x UK agreement, note: Demagog.cz) is highly criticized by some radical opponents of a soft Brexit, because Brexit was built, among other things, on the fact that populists claimed that citizens of countries from the eastern and central parts of the European Union were coming to us and taking jobs from the British. That was not true, but it was used in that campaign.\nSECTION D: TAKÁČ: Why are you and Mr. Čižinský not on that council? POSPÍŠIL: We have already explained it in detail, even on your television (...), we have clearly said that we are bringing a new style, a new form of government to Prague, we want experts to be on our behalf on the council. (...) I have clearly said that I am ready to be the mayor. The Pirates have clearly said that if they do not have the mayor, they will tear down this coalition.\nSECTION E: We are witnessing how Russia is behaving in eastern Ukraine. There is a real military conflict going on there, thousands of civilians, thousands of people have died there. (...) Russia is illegally occupying Crimea. This is annexation according to international law. And its behavior in this area towards Ukraine (...) is clearly in violation of international law. The EU has condemned this.\nSECTION F: The basic problem of the cooperation between KDU-ČSL and STAN was that their mutual agreement was at the level of the party leadership. I am convinced that both chairmen believed in it very much at the time and invested energy in this project. However, it was clear from the beginning that the membership base was not convinced of this project. Our current cooperation in the municipal elections is about something completely different. It was supported by one hundred percent of the members of the TOP 09 regional committee and by over 90 percent of the party members in STAN.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

We said that we will not go with undemocratic parties or support a government that will use their votes. So at the moment it is SPD or KSČM. And then we set clear conditions and those conditions of cooperation were there. It will not be a government that will have a majority of YES. There will be no people who have a corrupt past or are in a conflict of interest.\nSECTION B: I talked about the need to hire a dedicated person to set up communication processes and identify burnout among some politicians. I proposed a budget amendment so that we could pay for such an expert. I promised on our online forum that I would come up with some concrete proposal by Christmas. \nSECTION C: So I&#39;ll just briefly talk about Lukáš Wagenknecht. Andrej Babiš brought him to finance as a top analyst who fights corruption. And Lukáš Wagenknecht started doing his job, and of course Mr. Babiš didn&#39;t like that, so he fired him, he rejected him. Lukáš Wagenknecht was elected for the Pirates in the last election period in the last Senate elections,\nSECTION D: Editor: And Mr. Chairman, do you think that you are already an adult party and that what commentators often say about you, that you are toddlers with a flamethrower, because you burn everything out of the opposition, but you are unable to come to an agreement with anyone, no longer applies to you? Bartoš: That was a famous statement by Mr. Jindřich Šídl, I saw it when someone repeated it in your editorial office in a comment on the forum.\nSECTION E: I was happy, for example, that I could support another year of the Romea scholarship awards for Roma students of secondary and higher vocational schools with Olga Richterová. It is a great project, but unfortunately there is a double excess of applicants who should receive the scholarship. It is not high, but the 14 thousand is a lot for their families.\nSECTION F: EDITOR: ODS, TOP 09, STAN and the People&#39;s Party proposed rejecting measures that would burden people financially, whether it was doubling the land registry fee, taxing insurance company reserves, or maintaining a four percent tax on real estate transfers. You pushed through better conditions for home brewing and poker players. Isn&#39;t that a bit much?

Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: We are bothered by cooperation with the SPD, and that is why it (massive cooperation, note: Demagog.cz) does not occur. Therefore, there is only one case that I have repeatedly explained publicly and my colleagues from Kladno have also explained, and that is Kladno, where the situation is specific, where it was about choosing the lesser evil under conditions that are clearly given and which mean that no extremist views may have an influence on the governance of Kladno, and it is truly an exception.\nSECTION B: Here we agreed back then, I don&#39;t know if it was 3 or 4 years ago, on some solution that consisted of creating an automatic system, to compensate for some problems that had arisen in the past. And the point of the solution was that we would never have to go back to that. That simply, depending on the growth of the economy, the salaries would either go up or down.\nSECTION C: In some places, the people who made this political mistake ended their membership in ODS. Where the coalition cannot be dissolved, which is always the chance that everyone gets, then steps will have to be taken, such as revoking the license of the local association. These are rare cases.\n\nSECTION D: So you said it right, it was we who pointed out certain problems (in the Global Pact – note: Demagog.cz) and we wanted to explain it. The Minister of the Interior, Mr. Hamáček, who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, came and said: &quot;There is nothing wrong with that, it is good, we should support it, certainly, it is the right policy of the Czech government to support it.&quot; A few weeks later, a new Minister of Foreign Affairs comes from the same party and says: &quot;I will recommend that we actually not support it.&quot;\nSECTION E: Well, for the same reason that debates about the global pact are taking place in most European countries today. (...) There are a number of reasons (for not signing the Global Migration Pact – note: Demagog.cz). In addition to a certain vagueness of the formulations contained in the global pact, there is also a certain danger that the distinction between legal and illegal migration is no longer made.

I did not know that I would be presiding over the Chamber and standing in for Speaker Vondráček (Radek Vondráček from ANO), who suddenly lost his voice.&quot;</em></p><p> While Pikal apologizes for not having studied the personalities well enough, Chairman Bartoš talks about the item being put forward and the vote being taken by mistake. According to <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013121.htm\">the shorthand report,</a> the vote was as follows:</p><p> <em>PSP Deputy Chairman Vojtěch Pikal: The next proposal is Karel Sýs.<br/> PSP Deputy Chairman Vojtěch Filip: I have started voting number 96 and I am asking who is in favor. Who is against? Thank you.<br/> Voting number 96. Of the 161 deputies present, 108 voted in favor, 25 against. The proposal was adopted.</em></p><p> Pirates chairman Ivan Bartoš commented on the vote for Karel Sýs in an interview <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/474479-pirat-bartos-nekdy-delame-hlouposti-a-obcas-naletime-ale-jsme-pokorni.html\">as follows</a> :</p><p> &quot; <em>Nominations for the award were supposed to be discussed only at the end of the second week, but they were put forward. We had not gone through them. About three names were voted on in the plenary session within one minute, some Pirate MPs noticed the problematic Mr. Sýs and abstained from voting, some followed Vojta Pikal&#39;s recommendation.&quot;</em></p><p> On October 25, 2018, a vote was also taken on <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013117.htm\">a proposal</a> to permanently include item 117 regarding state awards on the same day, and this proposal was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=67735\">adopted</a> . The shortened period before the vote may therefore have had an impact on its outcome, although we cannot verify whether the Pirates voted &quot;by mistake&quot;.<br/><br/> The nomination required 81 MPs to vote in favor. The proposal to nominate Karel Sýs for the state award was approved, with a total of 108 MPs voting in favor, including 14 MPs from the Pirate Party. So even if the Pirate Party MPs had not voted in favor of the proposal, it would still have passed.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

You pushed through better conditions for home brewing and poker players. Isn&#39;t that a bit much? BARTOŠ: Their proposals didn&#39;t pass, ours did.\nSECTION B: I talked about the need to hire a dedicated person to set up communication processes and identify burnout among some politicians. I proposed a budget amendment so that we could pay for such an expert. I promised on our online forum that I would come up with some concrete proposal by Christmas. \nSECTION C: Even in the 2017 pre-election strategy, and in the next one, it is clearly defined. We said that we will not go with undemocratic parties or support a government that will use their votes. So at the moment it is SPD or KSČM. And then we set clear conditions and those conditions of cooperation were there. It will not be a government that will have a majority of YES. There will be no people who have a corrupt past or are in a conflict of interest.\nSECTION D: It was the first thing that the government, still a minority government of Andrej Babiš without confidence, started to address, the civil service law. And unfortunately, the proposal that then seemed to fall out of their hands, was so opposed by the European Commission that the original idea of the law, which would cut off the influence of the executive branch and politicians, ministers on the operation of state administration, would lead to so-called depoliticization, and that is what is being disrupted by these measures. \nSECTION E: Editor: And Mr. Chairman, do you think that you are already an adult party and that what commentators often say about you, that you are toddlers with a flamethrower, because you burn everything out of the opposition, but you are unable to come to an agreement with anyone, no longer applies to you? Bartoš: That was a famous statement by Mr. Jindřich Šídl, I saw it when someone repeated it in your editorial office in a comment on the forum.\nSECTION F: I was happy, for example, that I could support another year of the Romea scholarship awards for Roma students of secondary and higher vocational schools with Olga Richterová. It is a great project, but unfortunately there is a double excess of applicants who should receive the scholarship. It is not high, but the 14 thousand is a lot for their families.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: If you look, in Slovakia it cost, I mean Mochovce, three, four, which is approximately 1000 MW of power, it cost 6 billion euros. Yes, someone still claims, but you already had a base there in the order of one to two billion, so let&#39;s admit that it was 7 billion. That means, then it&#39;s around the amount of 100, 150, 160, 180 billion. It depends on the exchange rate used to convert it.\nSECTION B: And what is also extremely important, what was said by the European Commission, is that the energy mix is somehow the exclusive competence of individual European Union countries. We will not interfere with how you model it, on the other hand, you must meet certain legislative criteria also vis-à-vis the European Commission in terms of, for example, illegal support and the like. And if you meet all of this, we are ready to notify the process. \nSECTION C: HAVLÍČEK: (...) and then we have NÚKIB, an independent institution. TAKÁČ, moderator: Who stated what he stated that it is a security risk (Huawei, note: Demagog.cz). HAVLÍČEK: Yes, he stated it at the end of last year. At the moment, if I have the correct information, an audit of all devices is actually underway at the state level.\nSECTION D: We have been warning for several months and we also had security information that this (the operator entry auction, note: Demagog.cz) can only benefit one interested party, that there will be no foreign entity and that therefore what was expected from it will not happen, and that this is a really good competitive environment that will lead to a reduction in the prices of data services and the preparation of the environment for 5G.\nSECTION E: So we definitively announced that we are really going nuclear, we described what will be discussed, i.e. the fifth unit in Dukovany, and at the same time the so-called official negotiations have begun, which are not yet the exact itinerary of what, where, who will do exactly, but we had to start documenting why we are actually getting started. And the fundamental argument is clear, and I must say that the European Commission highly appreciated it - we are heading towards emission-free energy, that is, we will exchange coal, which today has a share of more than forty percent, for a higher position, i.e. the emergence of higher nuclear and renewable sources, and these are absolutely fundamental messages that to a certain extent actually correspond today with the priorities of the European Union or the European Commission.\nSECTION F: ALSO, moderator: And the European Union, the European Commission appreciated it? You said. Does that mean some philosophical reservation like: no nuclear, that&#39;s out of the question, that wasn&#39;t made? HAVLÍČEK: In no case was it made at all. On the contrary, what was said was that it is right that we are heading towards a zero-emission economy, or rather energy, ad 1 and ad 2, it was clearly said that nuclear is a zero-emission source. The fact that someone has a tendency from time to time, especially from among the critics, to question that, that was said literally and literally by the Director General, (...) that&#39;s what the Director General of the Directorate General Energo, the European Commission, said directly.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

And here we are, 2018, 475 crowns and this is the proposal of the minority government of the ANO movement. That, my government, which ruled brilliantly for 205 days, without confidence, but it worked perfectly, is increasing 918 crowns on average per month and another 1,000 crowns for pensioners aged 85. \nSECTION B: ...and I discussed it with him (Wolfgang Schäuble - note: Demagogue) and he always understood us, he saw it at the press conference and said yes, here is the Czech Republic, and the V4 have a different history, they don&#39;t have the multicultural model and we don&#39;t want it, because the foreigners haven&#39;t been integrated in the individual states. \nSECTION C: And I would like to show the audience that I made a contract with them here before the elections, in October 2017, and I am fulfilling those points. I pledged that we would never allow illegal migrants into our territory and that we would never agree to the distribution of migrants according to mandatory quotas. I fulfilled that in six months, we enforced that, yes.\nSECTION D: The result is that the chairman of the creditors&#39; committee, the administrator, Mr. Monsport and representatives of the cooperative were also there, so a timetable was agreed upon and that both parties would try to find a new expert who would take into account the investment in time of the people who actually live in those housing units.\nSECTION E: And then there is Libya. That is the biggest problem. There is not actually one government there, there are elections coming up, the Libyan guard, which we helped as part of Operation Sofia, is very effective. It is holding the ships, 84% and they didn&#39;t have oil in August. So Prime Minister Conte was dealing with oil, because it is a state-owned company, but the government was not able to force them to give the Libyan guard oil so that they could hold the ships.\nSECTION F: ...And I was with the admiral who is in charge of Operation Sofia.... We don&#39;t have the permission of the Libyan government, we don&#39;t have the permission of the UN Security Council, so the admiral is operating in that area, but he can&#39;t fight the smugglers on Libyan territory. So what is he doing? He says here that I have destroyed 551 ships and detained 151 migrants. But he will first save the ship and they are not random castaways, according to maritime law. They go there on purpose, yes. And by the way, there are still those non-profit ships waiting there that send signals: come, come, we are waiting. So they have to transport them to the port, the migrants are excited, within two hours, they have already tried it. They will say, well, that&#39;s the smuggler, he was on the ship with us. The smugglers then go to prison and then they destroy the ship. So this is really not like a systemic solution. There&#39;s a mafia here, they only trade in people and even oil and so on.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

      "question": "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: EDITOR: But you had a campaign based on a bus, in which you had pictures of various politicians. IVAN BARTOŠ: There was a funny bus, so everyone was in civilian clothes, there were caricatures and people from the Social Democrats were sitting there. People who were in the government for the KDU-ČSL and then for TOP 09, for example, were sitting there.\nSECTION B: So I&#39;ll just briefly talk about Lukáš Wagenknecht. Andrej Babiš brought him to finance as a top analyst who fights corruption. And Lukáš Wagenknecht started doing his job, and of course Mr. Babiš didn&#39;t like that, so he fired him, he rejected him. Lukáš Wagenknecht was elected for the Pirates in the last election period in the last Senate elections,\nSECTION C: I talked about the need to hire a dedicated person to set up communication processes and identify burnout among some politicians. I proposed a budget amendment so that we could pay for such an expert. I promised on our online forum that I would come up with some concrete proposal by Christmas. \nSECTION D: Even in the 2017 pre-election strategy, and in the next one, it is clearly defined. We said that we will not go with undemocratic parties or support a government that will use their votes. So at the moment it is SPD or KSČM. And then we set clear conditions and those conditions of cooperation were there. It will not be a government that will have a majority of YES. There will be no people who have a corrupt past or are in a conflict of interest.\nSECTION E: Editor: And Mr. Chairman, do you think that you are already an adult party and that what commentators often say about you, that you are toddlers with a flamethrower, because you burn everything out of the opposition, but you are unable to come to an agreement with anyone, no longer applies to you? Bartoš: That was a famous statement by Mr. Jindřich Šídl, I saw it when someone repeated it in your editorial office in a comment on the forum.\nSECTION F: He is on the election committee (Lukáš Wagenknecht, note: Demagog.cz), which elected him himself. There are a lot of people on the election committee. People from the media department, our politicians, regional campaign coordinators, and Lukáš Wagenknecht was elected there as the head who deals with the preparation of the campaign, its financing and coordination.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

      "question": "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Simply put, Brabec says in his statement that according to experts, spruce thrives in a wetter climate than a drier one, and that all experts claim this today. This corresponds to our research in the professional literature. We have reviewed several studies, in which, for example, the following formulations are found:</p><p> &quot; <em>Wiping and dying are affecting spruce stands of all ages, both artificially established and naturally regenerated. The mechanism of damage is not described in detail, but its basic cause is fluctuations in meteorological conditions, which can be linked to ongoing global climate change. The triggering mechanism of catastrophic damage is recurring periods of drought.</em> &quot; (V. Šrámek and K. Neudertová Hellebrandová, VULHM, p. 305, <a href=\"http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/ZLV/fulltext/469.pdf\">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>Spring and summer drought episodes are demonstrably not only a factor limiting plant growth, but also a significant predisposing stressor. Drought increases sensitivity to some biotic diseases (in particular, a higher incidence of vascular mycoses and diseases of the assimilation apparatus can be expected) and also increases the threat from insect pests.</em> &quot; (P. Čermák, VULHM, p. 9, <a href=\"http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/Sbornik_Budisov_2014_final_komp.pdf#page=11\">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>The most vulnerable point in the stability of spruce stands growing in the Czech Republic in lower forest vegetation stages (in the 5th to 3rd LVS) is the disruption of its moisture balance with a direct impact on the soil moisture regime and water reserves in the soil.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(P. Hadaš, LDF MZLU, <a href=\"http://cbks.cz/sbornik05b/Hadas2.pdf\">here</a> ).</p><p> In the studies we searched for, it is repeatedly stated that drought is a threatening factor for the growth of spruce trees. It is not in our power to determine whether all experts claim this, as Brabec says. However, the fact is that we were unable to find a study that would claim the opposite.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>The Czech government actually rejected the Russian accusation, as Brabec claims, and the Russian ambassador was indeed invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We assess the statement as true despite Brabec&#39;s inaccuracy that Minister Stropnický himself negotiated with the Russian ambassador. In reality, it was his deputy Šrámek.</p><p> The government opposed the Russian accusation <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/v-ceske-republice-nebyla-nikdy-vyrabena--vyvijena-ani-skladovana-zadna-latka-typu-novicok-165391/\">in a statement</a> issued after Prime Minister Babiš&#39;s meeting with the directors of the BIS and Military Intelligence. It states, among other things, that:</p><p> <i>&quot;No Novichok-type substance has ever been produced, developed or stored in the Czech Republic. This was stated unanimously by both intelligence services in their reports. In the Czech Republic, a program for the protection of troops and the population and the detection of weapons of mass destruction was launched in 2017. As part of this program, the Novichok A-230 substance was to be tested.</i></p><p> <i>In the first phase, the microsynthesis of the substance Novichok A-230 was carried out. During the microsynthesis, the substance was not isolated and this procedure is not considered production or development according to the methodology of the State Office for Nuclear Safety. The resulting product was immediately destroyed. The second phase of the program was not started. The substance of the Novichok A-230 type is different from the substance A-234, which was used in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom. The two substances are completely different and have a clearly different chemical structure.</i></p><p> Subsequently, as Brabec claims, the Russian ambassador was indeed invited. The Russian ambassador was <a href=\"https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/zive-stropnicky-si-predvolal-ruskeho-velvyslance-proc-moskva/r~272826e22d0e11e89efbac1f6b220ee8/\">informed of the Czech Republic&#39;s reservations</a> regarding Russia&#39;s accusation of producing Novichok (video from 4:57). However, the meeting with the Russian ambassador was not attended by Minister Stropnický, but by his deputy Šrámek (video from 00:10).</p>\nSECTION C: <p>On 17 December 2018, the government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/scripts/modules/fs/icv.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-zpravy/vysledky-jednani-vlady-17--prosince-2018-170824/\">approved</a> a draft law amending Act No. 248/2000 Coll., on the support of regional development, as amended. The draft law was submitted by <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/klara-dostalova-167026/\">the Minister</a> for Regional Development Klára Dostálová. Specifically, it is intended to amend Section 18(8) <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-248#p18-8\">of Act</a> No. 248/2000 Coll., which currently reads as follows: “ <em>The Council for the European Structural and Investment Funds (hereinafter referred to as the “Council”) is hereby established, which is an advisory body to the Government.</em> <strong><em>The Chairman of the Council is the Prime Minister.</em></strong> <em>Its members are representatives of central state administration bodies and representatives of advisory and working bodies of the Government.

IVAN BARTOŠ: There was a funny bus, so everyone was in civilian clothes, there were caricatures and people from the Social Democrats were sitting there. People who were in the government for the KDU-ČSL and then for TOP 09, for example, were sitting there.\nSECTION B: EDITOR: He stayed (Jakub Michálek, note: Demagog.cz), but he no longer wanted to run for first vice-chairman. IVAN BARTOŠ: Yes, he did. He announced that sometime in the middle of last year. After all, the focus of his work lies in the parliamentary club, where the chairman of the parliamentary club was elected last week and Jakub Michálek defended him.\nSECTION C: The Central Crisis Staff, which is also required by law, was not created at the very beginning. In fact, the government retained a kind of preferential right to announce its decisions to people, politicians, and companies through press conferences, and only then was the Central Crisis Staff created, which was supposed to be a body consisting of experts, which provides the government with the documents, and based on them, the government takes individual measures.\nSECTION D: I found something here that you wrote when the case started. Vojtěch Filip, I quote: &quot;Some so-called&quot; - I don&#39;t understand why so-called - &quot;municipal politicians have the audacity to do without a mandate from the voters&quot; - which they have - &quot;even foreign policy and go against the government of the Czech Republic. When they get into trouble because of it,&quot; - so you admit here that they are in trouble - &quot;they beg for the Czech Police to protect them with taxpayers&#39; money. Their police officers are suddenly not enough for them.&quot; You wrote that in response on Twitter.\nSECTION E: He is on the election committee (Lukáš Wagenknecht, note: Demagog.cz), which elected him himself. There are a lot of people on the election committee. People from the media department, our politicians, regional campaign coordinators, and Lukáš Wagenknecht was elected there as the head who deals with the preparation of the campaign, its financing and coordination.\nSECTION F: The fact that all states would have to agree to apply quotas or some kind of redistribution was not negotiated by Prime Minister Babiš and Mr. Orbán. We simply said that we did not agree with that, the Pirates said the same thing in their statement in 2015, and Sobotka negotiated it sometime in 2017 at a meeting of prime ministers.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
