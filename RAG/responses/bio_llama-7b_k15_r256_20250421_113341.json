    "question": "Recall the features of plant taxonomy and compare it with animal taxonomy. Find common and distinctive features.",
    "answer": "Plant taxonomy is the science of classifying plants into different groups based on their characteristics and shared traits, while animal taxonomy is the classification of animals into groups based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Some common features of plant taxonomy include the use of binomial nomenclature, the division of plants into kingdoms, divisions, classes, orders, families, and genera, and the use of botanical names to identify individual species. In contrast, animal taxonomy uses similar categories but with some distinct differences, such as the use of Latin names instead of botanical names, the division of animals into classes rather than kingdoms, and the recognition of more diverse groups such as orders and families within the animal kingdom. Both plant and animal taxonomy rely on the study of morphology, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology to understand the characteristics and relationships between different species.",
