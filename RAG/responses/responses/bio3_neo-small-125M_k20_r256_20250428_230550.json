There are open- and closed circulatory systems that perform important functions in the animal body. main functions of the transport system Fish heart By transporting substances (oxygen, carbon dioxide gas, nutrients, metabolic products) between different parts of the animal's body, transport the system connects these parts together.\nfunctioning. organisms, learned to compare the structure of animals of different groups as a result of adaptation to their environments. You have become familiar with the main properties and features animals: nutrition, respiration, excretion, reproduction, growth, development. Now you can not only talk about the structure and function of of animal organisms of different groups, but also to find cause-and-effect relationships connections between them. Such a connection can also be found between the features of the markets and environmental factors. It was formed during evolution and underlies the unity of the organic world.\norganisms differs significantly. Yes, in mammals it is small, because the embryo is not needs a large supply of substances. It gets everything it needs from the or- of the mother's body. And in birds, the zygote is large - it is the yolk of the egg. In birds, It contains the substances necessary for the development of the embryo (Fig. 41.2). Then the zygote divides, resulting in the formation of a certain number of very similar cells."
