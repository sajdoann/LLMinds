    "question": "What is ethology and what does it study?",
    "answer": "Ethology is the study of animal behavior, and it is based on the principles of evolution and natural selection. It is one of the branches of biology and is concerned with the study of how animals behave in their environments and how they adapt to their surroundings. Ethologists use various techniques to study animal behavior, including observation, experimentation, and data analysis. The study of animal behavior is important because it helps us understand how animals interact with each other and with their environment, and it can also inform conservation efforts by identifying endangered species and their habitats.",

    "answer": "The complexity of the life of an ethologist researcher is comparable to that of a biologist who conducts experiments in the laboratory. This is because ethologists study animal behavior and ecology, which are both complex and dynamic processes that require a high degree of attention and care. Ethologists must carefully observe and analyze the behavior of animals in their natural environment, and they must also consider the social and ecological interactions between animals to fully understand their behavior. In contrast, biologists primarily study the properties and functions of living organisms, such as their genetics, metabolism, and adaptation to their environment, and they use experimental techniques to test their hypotheses and develop theories about these processes.",

It happens open (in mollusks, arthropods) and closed (in annelids, arachnids and vertebrates). Blood in the body moves through blood vessels - arteries, veins and capillaries. ANIMAL LIFE PROCESSES 34 Excretion in animals In the process of metabolism in animal organisms substances are constantly being formed that can be harmful to them. That is why animals need constantly remove them from the body. To do this, in their The human body has a special excretory system.\nsexual reproduction to occur, it is necessary to the presence of germ cells is possible. ANIMAL LIFE PROCESSES Animal development. Individual development 41 Development is the process of forming an organism, its individual parts, organs and organ systems. The The flow usually occurs simultaneously with the growth of Volume: Growth and development are the basic properties living organisms. Evolutionary and individual development In biology, a distinction is made between evolutionary and individual development. Evolutionary development is a process of successive historical changes, that occur to organisms over a long period of time during several generations.\nin the environment external environment. It is inherent in everyone individual organism and each living cell has many cellular organism. basic functions of the nervous system The main task of the nervous system is to ensure the reaction the body to the effects of external factors. For example, a dog squints eyes when the light is turned on, the bear hibernates when the light is lowered temperatures, reindeer migrate in the absence of food. It also coordinates the work of various organs and systems of the body.\nAn animal, when it stops reproducing, becomes less viable. Her chances of survival decrease, and the likelihood of death increases. Death is the cessation of existence. Thanks to death on the planet there is a change of generations, and therefore, evolution takes place. Thus Thus, the death of an individual contributes to the development of the species. Indirect postembryonic development In indirect development, a larva hatches or is born. which, in terms of structure and lifestyle, is significantly different from adults logo of the organism (Fig. 42.2).\nrepresentatives of animals with limited growth Fig. 41.5.

Locust infestation is considered a natural disaster Phase variability Locusts and some other insects are characterized by phase variability. Its essence lies in the fact that that when larvae are in large numbers (swarm phase), changes occur in their appearance external structure and behavior: individuals differ in body proportions, have brighter covers, aggressive behavior, tendency to migrate.\nvertebrates, in the place of These muscle attachments to the bone have a complex surface relief with mounds and depressions. It is by studying the relief of the bones of extinct animals that scientists are reproducing the size and shape of their muscles. And they're reproducing very It's hard work, but it allows us to learn how Animals that had long since died out looked and moved.

Animals are characterized by external and internal fertilization Fertilization can occur both in the external environment (in external fertilization), and inside the animal's body (internal fertilization) fertilization). External fertilization is characteristic of bivalves, crayfish, most bony fish, and amphibians. Internal — insects, reptiles, birds, mammals (Fig. 40.4).\ntheir by it the body through diffusion, and parasitic animals, who have adapted to life in the absence of oxygen. ANIMAL LIFE PROCESSES 33 Transport of substances in animals The transport of substances is necessary for many cli- organisms. This function is found in most animals performed by the circulatory system. There are open- and closed circulatory systems that perform important functions in the animal body. main functions of the transport system Fish heart By transporting substances (oxygen, carbon dioxide gas, nutrients, metabolic products) between different parts of the animal's body, transport the system connects these parts together.\nfunctioning. organisms, learned to compare the structure of animals of different groups as a result of adaptation to their environments. You have become familiar with the main properties and features animals: nutrition, respiration, excretion, reproduction, growth, development. Now you can not only talk about the structure and function of of animal organisms of different groups, but also to find cause-and-effect relationships connections between them. Such a connection can also be found between the features of the markets and environmental factors. It was formed during evolution and underlies the unity of the organic world.\norganisms differs significantly. Yes, in mammals it is small, because the embryo is not needs a large supply of substances. It gets everything it needs from the or- of the mother's body. And in birds, the zygote is large - it is the yolk of the egg. In birds, It contains the substances necessary for the development of the embryo (Fig. 41.2). Then the zygote divides, resulting in the formation of a certain number of very similar cells.\nof the or- organization of each animal and its environment.

Animals are hetero- trophs. In the process of evolution, they have adapted to certain conditions of existence and obtaining energy through food, which occurs through digestion. Digestion carried out by the organs of the digestive system.\nthe embryo (Fig. 41.2). Then the zygote divides, resulting in the formation of a certain number of very similar cells. In the early stages, each such a cell can grow into a complete organism (this can occur in polyembryony or as a result of scientific experiments). Then the process of differentiation begins, that is, the acquisition of clients. with distinctive features. Initially, the cells form two layers, as in intestinal-coelomate animals, i.e. ectoderm and endoderm. A little later in all multicellular animals except coelenterates, the third germ layer, the mesoderm, is formed.\nis a process of successive historical changes, that occur to organisms over a long period of time during several generations.

Periods of individual development. embryonic stage Individual development is divided into two stages - embryonic, or embryonic, and postembryonic. The embryonic stage is all the processes of growth and development of an organism that occur before its emergence hatching from an egg or birth (Fig. 41.1).\nthe permeability of the covers changes significantly for water. That's why it's hard for crustaceans to survive on dry land. The water from their bodies evaporates straight through the shell Bare skin with a big quantity glands Such external integuments are characteristic of amphibians.

That is, those organs that in the process evolutionary development appeared earlier, in individual development also develop earlier. And those that arose later, respectively and develop later.
