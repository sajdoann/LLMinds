    "question": "What three negative effects of vaccination are mentioned on the Internet?",
    "answer": "First, the number of people vaccinated has increased dramatically. And it's not just the number of children who get measles. The number of vaccinations has also increased. And vaccination has also increased more than other diseases.\n\nThis is the second positive effect of vaccination, which is that people are less likely to get a serious infection. The vaccination debate is a complex one. The main problem with the debate between politicians and researchers is that it's not just the number of people vaccinated, but also the number of people who are infected, and the number of people whose illness is serious. So it's not just the number of people vaccinated, but also the number of people who are infected with a particular disease, and the number of people whose illness is serious. The numbers of people who get measles, and the number of people whose illness is serious, are different. The number of people who get measles, and the number of people whose illness is serious, is different.\n\nSo we don't have one positive effect of vaccination, but two negative effects.\n\nDo our children",
    "context": "Vaccinations are incredibly important for fighting disease. But an increasingly large group of people seem to believe that vaccinations put our health at risk. There are many reports on the internet of negative vaccination effects such as allergies, disabilities and even deaths. And it's true, vaccination can have side effects. How do vaccinations work and how dangerous are they really? Your immune system is a complex army of billions of cells: Soldiers, information repositories and weapons factories.\neverything in life, vaccinations have a downside: Side effects. What are they and what happens if your child is affected? It's difficult to directly compare the side effects of vaccinations with the effects of diseases. For example, hundreds of millions of people in the West have been vaccinated against measles. But there were only 83,000 cases of measles in Europe in 2018. With such disparate numbers, even minor side effects seem frightening when compared to the consequences of a disease we no longer even know about.\nand technology. Should we risk the side effects of a vaccination? How about a thought experiment based on real figures? In an industrialized nation, in a parallel universe with good medical care, vaccination has been discontinued. Let's assume that 10,000,000 children are infected with measles there. What happens? 9,800,000 or 98% get a high fever and an unpleasant rash. Up to 800,000 of them, or 8%, suffer from dangerous diarrhea. 700,000 or 7% get a middle ear infection, which can lead to permanent hearing loss. 600,000 children, or 6%, get pneumonia, the most dangerous side effect of measles.\nbe vaccinated. They kill healthy children who are simply unlucky. They bring serious diseases back from the brink of extinction.

So if we vaccinate 10,000,000 children, a total of 120 of them will have more serious side effects. Thanks to good medical care in industrialized countries, almost all of them will survive well.

You can find literature references and videos on this in the video description. In 2019, however, one thing is certain: vaccination does not cause autism. And what about deaths?\ntoo. So back to our thought experiment, but now let's vaccinate 10,000,000 children with the MMR vaccine. What happens now? After they are vaccinated, about 10% of our 10,000,000 children get a fever. 500,000, 5%, get a slight rash. Up to 100 or 0.001% may have a serious allergic reaction that needs to be treated. Up to 10 boys, or 0.0001%, may develop genital inflammation. And up to 10 children or 0.0001% may experience the worst side effect: Encephalitis. So if we vaccinate 10,000,000 children, a total of 120 of them will have more serious side effects.\naround you need to be vaccinated. The problem with the vaccination debate is that it is not being conducted fairly.

We won't convince anyone by shouting down their concerns, but we can't hide from what such conspiracy theories do: They kill babies who are too young to be vaccinated. They kill healthy children who are simply unlucky. They bring serious diseases back from the brink of extinction.\nthe real pathogen in the laboratory. One that's just powerful enough to nerve the immune system and create memory cells. This is the basic principle of vaccinations. They provoke a natural reaction in our body that makes us immune to dangerous diseases. Some pathogens, such as the flu virus, mutate so frequently that we need a new vaccine every year. But most vaccinations protect us for years or even a lifetime. But wait a minute. Like everything in life, vaccinations have a downside: Side effects. What are they and what happens if your child is affected?\nchildren will suffer the more severe effects of measles. Approximately 20,000 children will die from measles. But that's not all. The children who survive will have a severely damaged immune system that takes a long time to recover. They are therefore more susceptible to further illnesses. Apart from that, these children will almost certainly be really unwell for two weeks. Okay, but what about vaccinations? It's only fair to look at the consequences here too. So back to our thought experiment, but now let's vaccinate 10,000,000 children with the MMR vaccine. What happens now?\nsmall handful of documented deaths, out of hundreds of millions of children who have received the MMR vaccine since 1971. Measles is many, many thousands of times more dangerous to our children than the absolute worst case of vaccine side effects. You have to look with a huge magnifying glass for fatal side effects from vaccinations, and even then it's hard to find confirmed cases. Whereas measles deaths are very real and very easy to find. In 2017, 110,000 people worldwide died from measles alone. Statistically, 300 children die from measles today, one since this video started.\neven minor side effects seem frightening when compared to the consequences of a disease we no longer even know about. Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963, virtually every child in the world contracted measles at some point. In the 1950s, that equated to around 135 million cases every year. But is measles really that dangerous in 2019? We are so far advanced in terms of medicine and technology. Should we risk the side effects of a vaccination? How about a thought experiment based on real figures?\nwhich can lead to permanent hearing loss. 600,000 children, or 6%, get pneumonia, the most dangerous side effect of measles. It alone will kill 12,000 children. Up to 10,000 children or 0.1% will contract encephalitis. 2,500 children, 0.025%, will be infected with SSPE, a disease in which the measles virus remains in the child's brain and kills them a few years later. In total, therefore, around 2.5 million children will suffer the more severe effects of measles. Approximately 20,000 children will die from measles. But that's not all.\nin the video description. In 2019, however, one thing is certain: vaccination does not cause autism. And what about deaths? It is actually very difficult to say whether even a single one of our 10 million vaccinated children would die. We have done a lot of research on this and spoken to many experts. Excluding self-assessments, we could only find a small handful of documented deaths, out of hundreds of millions of children who have received the MMR vaccine since 1971.\n2017, 110,000 people worldwide died from measles alone. Statistically, 300 children die from measles today, one since this video started. You can compare vaccinations to seatbelts. Are there tragic accidents where someone is killed by their seatbelt? Yes, there are. But do you think that makes it safer not to buckle children in? But wait, what if your child is actually allergic? What if our facts don't apply to your specific situation? That's when you would have to become the biggest vaccination advocate of all. Because if you can't get your child vaccinated, only the community can protect them.\nthe biggest vaccination advocate of all. Because if you can't get your child vaccinated, only the community can protect them. This is called herd immunity and it's the only protection your unvaccinated child has. Herd immunity means that so many people are immune to a disease that the pathogen cannot spread, but dies before it can reach its victims. But to achieve this with measles, 95% of all people around you need to be vaccinated. The problem with the vaccination debate is that it is not being conducted fairly.\nimmune forever. This is why young children, for example, are constantly ill. They have not yet formed enough memory cells. And we rely on this great, natural mechanism when we vaccinate. As great as memory cells are, getting them through an infection is unpleasant and potentially dangerous. Vaccines trick our bodies into creating memory cells and becoming immune to disease: They pretend to be a dangerous infection. For example, harmless pathogens can be injected. They are rendered harmless by killing or fragmenting them. Our immune system can cope with such vaccinations quite easily."

    "question": "What three types of cells make up the immune system?",
    "answer": "There are 3 types of cells: immune cells, antigen-presenting cells, and memory cells.\n\nQ. Are there any real advantages to using live vaccines?\n\nA: The most important is that you can get antibodies against the active ingredient in your vaccine. This is a really good thing. You can get antibodies against the active ingredient in the vaccine for many years. If the vaccine is not effective then there is no need to use this vaccine.\n\nQ. What about memory cells?\n\nA: The memory is formed by a memory cell that is not proliferating. We don't have to use it to make antibodies. It's much more important that it be activated. We use them for a number of reasons. First of all, they keep us healthy. They don't kill us. They don't damage us. They don't make us sick. They don't kill us. They don't make us sick.

After they are vaccinated, about 10% of our 10,000,000 children get a fever. 500,000, 5%, get a slight rash. Up to 100 or 0.001% may have a serious allergic reaction that needs to be treated. Up to 10 boys, or 0.0001%, may develop genital inflammation. And up to 10 children or 0.0001% may experience the worst side effect: Encephalitis. So if we vaccinate 10,000,000 children, a total of 120 of them will have more serious side effects.\neffect: Encephalitis. So if we vaccinate 10,000,000 children, a total of 120 of them will have more serious side effects. Thanks to good medical care in industrialized countries, almost all of them will survive well. And autism? The link between autism and vaccinations comes from a single source, which has since been refuted many times. You can find literature references and videos on this in the video description. In 2019, however, one thing is certain: vaccination does not cause autism. And what about deaths?\nwhich can lead to permanent hearing loss. 600,000 children, or 6%, get pneumonia, the most dangerous side effect of measles. It alone will kill 12,000 children. Up to 10,000 children or 0.1% will contract encephalitis. 2,500 children, 0.025%, will be infected with SSPE, a disease in which the measles virus remains in the child's brain and kills them a few years later. In total, therefore, around 2.5 million children will suffer the more severe effects of measles. Approximately 20,000 children will die from measles. But that's not all.\nVaccinations are incredibly important for fighting disease. But an increasingly large group of people seem to believe that vaccinations put our health at risk. There are many reports on the internet of negative vaccination effects such as allergies, disabilities and even deaths. And it's true, vaccination can have side effects.

Because if you can't get your child vaccinated, only the community can protect them. This is called herd immunity and it's the only protection your unvaccinated child has. Herd immunity means that so many people are immune to a disease that the pathogen cannot spread, but dies before it can reach its victims. But to achieve this with measles, 95% of all people around you need to be vaccinated. The problem with the vaccination debate is that it is not being conducted fairly.\neven minor side effects seem frightening when compared to the consequences of a disease we no longer even know about. Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963, virtually every child in the world contracted measles at some point. In the 1950s, that equated to around 135 million cases every year. But is measles really that dangerous in 2019? We are so far advanced in terms of medicine and technology. Should we risk the side effects of a vaccination?

They have not yet formed enough memory cells.\nare they really? Your immune system is a complex army of billions of cells: Soldiers, information repositories and weapons factories.

They are like guided missiles built to fight a specific attacker. Unfortunately, this process takes several days. This gives the attacker enough time to inflict damage.\nto fight a specific attacker. Unfortunately, this process takes several days. This gives the attacker enough time to inflict damage. Contrary to popular belief, what doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger.

    "question": "Thought experiment without measles vaccination: What percentage of children would have dangerous diarrhea?",
    "answer": "My daughter is a child who is under the age of two. If she is vaccinated, the diarrhea will go away. A few days after the vaccination, she will get pneumonia, and the diarrhea will go away. Then there will be a rash, she will get a mild rash in the ear, and after that she will get mild arthritis. But the symptoms will go away very soon. It seems like measles is one of the worst side effects of vaccination.\n\nQUESTION:What is the best vaccination method for children?\nANSWER: Yes, because it works in many places. We have to take this seriously because vaccines can increase the chance of a child getting sick. But there are also medical reasons why children should be vaccinated.\nIt's almost impossible to decide which vaccines to choose.

    "question": "How many children out of 10 million would have an allergic reaction after vaccination against measles? (Percentage or number)",
    "answer": "One of the main reasons why measles is so common is because of the fact that it's one of the most common diseases in the world. So if you have children in other countries, you have to be vaccinated, because they are naturally allergic to measles.\n\nA new study published in the journal Frontiers in Immunology predicts that vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, could be reduced by as much as 15% by 2020. That's because they're already so common. In 2016, researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found a correlation between the incidence of measles in the United States and the incidence of measles in the United Kingdom. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nWhat is a vaccine?\n\nThe key phrase is, \"vaccine is good for you.\" This is the scientific term for all vaccines, but it's often used for vaccines that don't provide the protection they want. It's a good term, but it's also",
    "context": "too. So back to our thought experiment, but now let's vaccinate 10,000,000 children with the MMR vaccine. What happens now? After they are vaccinated, about 10% of our 10,000,000 children get a fever. 500,000, 5%, get a slight rash. Up to 100 or 0.001% may have a serious allergic reaction that needs to be treated. Up to 10 boys, or 0.0001%, may develop genital inflammation. And up to 10 children or 0.0001% may experience the worst side effect: Encephalitis.

Up to 800,000 of them, or 8%, suffer from dangerous diarrhea. 700,000 or 7% get a middle ear infection, which can lead to permanent hearing loss. 600,000 children, or 6%, get pneumonia, the most dangerous side effect of measles.\nchildren will suffer the more severe effects of measles.

What happens now?\neverything in life, vaccinations have a downside: Side effects. What are they and what happens if your child is affected? It's difficult to directly compare the side effects of vaccinations with the effects of diseases. For example, hundreds of millions of people in the West have been vaccinated against measles. But there were only 83,000 cases of measles in Europe in 2018. With such disparate numbers, even minor side effects seem frightening when compared to the consequences of a disease we no longer even know about.\n2017, 110,000 people worldwide died from measles alone. Statistically, 300 children die from measles today, one since this video started. You can compare vaccinations to seatbelts. Are there tragic accidents where someone is killed by their seatbelt? Yes, there are. But do you think that makes it safer not to buckle children in? But wait, what if your child is actually allergic? What if our facts don't apply to your specific situation? That's when you would have to become the biggest vaccination advocate of all. Because if you can't get your child vaccinated, only the community can protect them.\nwhich can lead to permanent hearing loss. 600,000 children, or 6%, get pneumonia, the most dangerous side effect of measles. It alone will kill 12,000 children. Up to 10,000 children or 0.1% will contract encephalitis. 2,500 children, 0.025%, will be infected with SSPE, a disease in which the measles virus remains in the child's brain and kills them a few years later. In total, therefore, around 2.5 million children will suffer the more severe effects of measles. Approximately 20,000 children will die from measles. But that's not all.\neven minor side effects seem frightening when compared to the consequences of a disease we no longer even know about.

What happens now?\neven minor side effects seem frightening when compared to the consequences of a disease we no longer even know about. Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963, virtually every child in the world contracted measles at some point. In the 1950s, that equated to around 135 million cases every year.

As great as memory cells are, getting them through an infection is unpleasant and potentially dangerous.

Yes, there are. But do you think that makes it safer not to buckle children in? But wait, what if your child is actually allergic? What if our facts don't apply to your specific situation?

In an industrialized nation with good medical care, vaccination has been discontinued. Let's assume that 10,000,000 children are infected with measles there. What happens now? After they are vaccinated, about 10% of our 10,000,000 children get a fever. 500,000 or 5%, get a slight rash. Up to 100 or 0.001% may have a serious allergic reaction that needs to be treated.

    "context": "everything in life, vaccinations have a downside: Side effects. What are they and what happens if your child is affected? It's difficult to directly compare the side effects of vaccinations with the effects of diseases. For example, hundreds of millions of people in the West have been vaccinated against measles. But there were only 83,000 cases of measles in Europe in 2018. With such disparate numbers, even minor side effects seem frightening when compared to the consequences of a disease we no longer even know about.\nbe vaccinated. They kill healthy children who are simply unlucky. They bring serious diseases back from the brink of extinction.

Should we risk the side effects of a vaccination? How about a thought experiment based on real figures? In an industrialized nation, in a parallel universe with good medical care, vaccination has been discontinued. Let's assume that 10,000,000 children are infected with measles there. What happens? 9,800,000 or 98% get a high fever and an unpleasant rash. Up to 800,000 of them, or 8%, suffer from dangerous diarrhea. 700,000 or 7% get a middle ear infection, which can lead to permanent hearing loss. 600,000 children, or 6%, get pneumonia, the most dangerous side effect of measles.\nVaccinations are incredibly important for fighting disease. But an increasingly large group of people seem to believe that vaccinations put our health at risk. There are many reports on the internet of negative vaccination effects such as allergies, disabilities and even deaths. And it's true, vaccination can have side effects. How do vaccinations work and how dangerous are they really? Your immune system is a complex army of billions of cells: Soldiers, information repositories and weapons factories.\ntoo. So back to our thought experiment, but now let's vaccinate 10,000,000 children with the MMR vaccine. What happens now? After they are vaccinated, about 10% of our 10,000,000 children get a fever. 500,000, 5%, get a slight rash. Up to 100 or 0.001% may have a serious allergic reaction that needs to be treated. Up to 10 boys, or 0.0001%, may develop genital inflammation. And up to 10 children or 0.0001% may experience the worst side effect: Encephalitis. So if we vaccinate 10,000,000 children, a total of 120 of them will have more serious side effects.\neffect: Encephalitis. So if we vaccinate 10,000,000 children, a total of 120 of them will have more serious side effects. Thanks to good medical care in industrialized countries, almost all of them will survive well. And autism? The link between autism and vaccinations comes from a single source, which has since been refuted many times. You can find literature references and videos on this in the video description. In 2019, however, one thing is certain: vaccination does not cause autism. And what about deaths?\nchildren will suffer the more severe effects of measles. Approximately 20,000 children will die from measles. But that's not all. The children who survive will have a severely damaged immune system that takes a long time to recover. They are therefore more susceptible to further illnesses. Apart from that, these children will almost certainly be really unwell for two weeks. Okay, but what about vaccinations? It's only fair to look at the consequences here too. So back to our thought experiment, but now let's vaccinate 10,000,000 children with the MMR vaccine. What happens now?\nwhich can lead to permanent hearing loss. 600,000 children, or 6%, get pneumonia, the most dangerous side effect of measles. It alone will kill 12,000 children. Up to 10,000 children or 0.1% will contract encephalitis. 2,500 children, 0.025%, will be infected with SSPE, a disease in which the measles virus remains in the child's brain and kills them a few years later. In total, therefore, around 2.5 million children will suffer the more severe effects of measles. Approximately 20,000 children will die from measles. But that's not all.\nthe real pathogen in the laboratory. One that's just powerful enough to nerve the immune system and create memory cells. This is the basic principle of vaccinations. They provoke a natural reaction in our body that makes us immune to dangerous diseases. Some pathogens, such as the flu virus, mutate so frequently that we need a new vaccine every year.

Because if you can't get your child vaccinated, only the community can protect them. This is called herd immunity and it's the only protection your unvaccinated child has. Herd immunity means that so many people are immune to a disease that the pathogen cannot spread, but dies before it can reach its victims. But to achieve this with measles, 95% of all people around you need to be vaccinated. The problem with the vaccination debate is that it is not being conducted fairly."
