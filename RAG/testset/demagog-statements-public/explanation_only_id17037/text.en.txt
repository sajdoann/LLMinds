<p>Two parliamentary proposals dealing with the definition of marriage were recently submitted to the Chamber of Deputies. According to the first <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135812">proposal</a> (.pdf), which was sent to deputies on June 13, the Civil Code and related regulations should be amended, and the definition of marriage contained therein as a union between a man and a woman should be changed to a union between two people.</p><p> The proposal to equalize same-sex unions <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=201&amp;sp=1">was submitted by</a> a group of deputies from ANO, Pirates, ČSSD, TOP 09, KSČM and STAN. The Pirates club was the most united in this case, with seventeen out of the total twenty-two deputies submitting the bill.</p><p> Two days later, another <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135903">proposal</a> (.pdf) was sent to the deputies, according to which the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms should be amended, where Article 32 would be supplemented with an explicit definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Currently, the first sentence <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-2#cl32-1">of Article 32</a> protects parenthood and the family; if the amendment to the Charter is approved, parenthood, family and marriage as a union between a man and a woman would be protected.</p><p> The proposal to amend the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=211&amp;sp=1">was submitted by</a> a group of deputies from the parliamentary groups ANO, KDU-ČSL, ODS, ČSSD, TOP 09 and STAN. Apart from the KDU-ČSL club, where all ten deputies submitted the proposal, the other parliamentary groups were by no means united. </p><div><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-gCEa9" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gCEa9/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="390"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["gCEa9"]={},window.datawrapper["gCEa9"].embedDeltas={"100":471,"200":444,"300":417,"400":417,"500":390,"700":390,"800":390,"900":390,"1000":390},window.datawrapper["gCEa9"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-gCEa9"),window.datawrapper["gCEa9"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["gCEa9"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["gCEa9"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("gCEa9"==b)window.datawrapper["gCEa9"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});</script></div><p> From the table we can see that the deputies (with the exception of the KDU-ČSL club and to some extent the Pirates) do not really decide according to the party program, but very freely according to their own discretion. Thus, in several parliamentary clubs there are both streams of opinion, i.e. deputies who support equal rights for same-sex unions and those who, on the contrary, want to protect marriage as a union between a man and a woman by constitutional order.</p><p> In the last election period, <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=111102">a proposal</a> (.pdf) to amend the Registered Partnership Act was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow registered partners to adopt the child of the other partner, thus ensuring the child&#39;s equal legal relationship to both partners. This proposal was also <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=7&amp;t=320&amp;sp=1">submitted</a> by a very diverse group of MPs from six parliamentary groups (all except the KDU-ČSL group), but it was not voted on.</p>
