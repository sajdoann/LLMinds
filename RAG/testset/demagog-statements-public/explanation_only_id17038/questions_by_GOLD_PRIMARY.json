    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: In our country, this is more visible now because of the case of Mrs. Chalánková, but there are also diverse opinions in other parties, for example on whether or not to support gay marriage or adoption by same-sex couples. Other parties also let their deputies decide on these ethical matters according to their conscience, and not according to some dictated party program.\nSECTION B: Current: Miroslav Kalousek and Karel Schwarzenberg criticized you for agreeing with Babiš, who refused to accept several refugees directly in the Czech Republic. Aren&#39;t you abandoning the values on which TOP 09 stands? Pospíšil: First of all, it must be said that I have never praised Babiš for this. This distortion was brought by Parlamentní listy.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
