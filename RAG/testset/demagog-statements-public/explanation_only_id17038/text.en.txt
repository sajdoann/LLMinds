<p>Jiří Pospíšil stated in an interview for Czech Radio that if Andrej Babiš proceeds in this way, he should offer the Italian government another form of assistance. Although he did not directly criticize his actions, he did not express direct approval either. That he would directly defend Babiš is indeed an abbreviation that was published by Parlamentní listy in its text.</p><p> The chairman of TOP 09 <a href="https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/jiri-pospisil-z-top-09-vadi-mi-legitimizace-kscm-a-personalni-nestabilita-vlady-7568537">commented</a> on Andrej Babiš&#39;s response to the Italian government&#39;s refusal to accept some refugees (video, 7:12) on Radiožurnál&#39;s 20 minut program. However, he did not directly agree with the prime minister&#39;s decision, only stating that it would be good to offer Italy other assistance in such a case and not close ourselves off from further communication.</p><p> <em>&quot;I personally think that at a time when the Czech Republic and, in principle, the entire political representation rejects mandatory quotas, the redistribution of refugees against their will across Europe, it would be reasonable to offer the Italian side some other form of assistance than accepting refugees who are not going to the Czech Republic themselves and have not applied for asylum in the Czech Republic. I am convinced that we should grant asylum to those who apply for asylum in the Czech Republic and meet the conditions of Czech legislation and Czech laws.&quot;</em></p><p> His response <a href="https://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/arena/monitor/Sef-TOP-09-Pospisil-se-zastal-Babise-ve-veci-prijimani-uprchliku-Opravdu-544446">was distorted by</a> Parlamentní listy, which incorrectly reported Jiří Pospíšil&#39;s agreement with Andrej Babiš in the headline of the article: &quot; <em>Top 09 boss Pospíšil stood up for Babiš on the issue of accepting refugees. Really.&quot;</em> Therefore, we assess the statement as true.</p><p> Miroslav Kalousek and Karel Schwarzenberg criticized Jiří Pospíšil&#39;s alleged statement as inconsistent with TOP09&#39;s current policy. Miroslav Kalousek did so on his <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/kalousekm">Twitter</a> account, where <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/kalousekm/status/1019668599047376897">he stated</a> that he respects his chairman, but cannot agree with his opinion. </p><img src="https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcThIIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--532043fe64b0c36ec5a9956b4d6523d2c3645a4c/Kalousek.JPG" alt=""/><p> Karel Schwarzenberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/karel.schwarzenberg/posts/10155878321623925">also</a> made a similar statement on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/karel.schwarzenberg/?hc_ref=ARQbgOTuh5xns5Yx8S6k29APpGeo0c7HIs7Fjn3v2xAreXKCH3UEh9FkxpI0wl8LwLE&amp;fref=nf">his Facebook</a> page: <em>&quot;The government&#39;s attitude towards the Italian Prime Minister&#39;s request is, firstly, stupid, secondly, inhumane, and thirdly, contrary to our principles, which are based on our Judeo-Christian spiritual heritage.&quot;</em> He also spoke in a similar vein in <a href="https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66206170-meli-jsme-vyhovet-italii-a-prijmout-uprchliky-pro-eu-prestavame-byt-seriozni-a-duveryhodni-rika-schwarzenberg">an interview</a> with Hospodářské noviny. </p><img src="https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBckFIIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e345ae7ed0b5863afd5c6e6caa6629e6e446c1a7/Schwarzenberg.JPG" alt=""/><p><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
