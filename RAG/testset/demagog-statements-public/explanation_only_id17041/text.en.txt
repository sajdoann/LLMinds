<p>Although the approval of the electoral coalition between STAN and KDU-ČSL for the 2017 elections was not always supported by an overwhelming majority of the membership, its participation, albeit somewhat limited, in the approval process of their coalition cooperation cannot be denied. The coalition project was not formed only at the level of the party leadership, as Pospíšil states.</p><p> One of the first reports of possible cooperation between the KDU-ČSL and STAN appeared in December 2016, when the KDU-ČSL National Conference <a href="https://kdu.cz/aktualne/archiv/2016/kdu-csl-jsme-pripraveni-jednat-o-spolupraci-se-sta">authorized</a> the party&#39;s presidium to begin negotiations for cooperation in the upcoming elections to the Chamber of Deputies in 2017.</p><p> Initially, there was the possibility of a so-called integration party, in which a new entity would be created, whose candidate lists would consist of members of two cooperating parties. However, this project was <a href="https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/info-a-media/tiskove-zpravy/o-koalici-s-kdu-csl-rozhodneme-brzy">rejected by</a> the KDU-ČSL National Conference, and instead <a href="https://kdu.cz/aktualne/archiv/2017/kdu-csl-celostatni-konference-podporuje-dlouhodobo">the conference authorized</a> the presidium to negotiate cooperation between the parties at the level of an electoral coalition.</p><p> The offer of coalition cooperation for the 2017 elections was accepted by the Mayor when a similar mandate for the leadership of STAN was <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2032940-starostove-chteji-jit-do-voleb-v-koalici-s-lidovci-museli-ziskat-pres-10-procent">approved by</a> 81% of the delegates <a href="https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/nasi-lide/celostatni-vybor-stan">of the STAN National Committee.</a></p><p> The electoral coalition was also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2060128-lidovci-souhlasi-se-spolecnou-koalici-se-starosty-pujdou-do-voleb">approved</a> by the KDU-ČSL National Conference on 18 March 2017 with 39 delegates in favour and 31 against. A week later, the coalition cooperation was also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2064908-starostove-chteji-kandidovat-s-lidovci-pro-koalici-bylo-86-procent-delegatu">approved</a> by the STAN (Supreme Council of the Republic), with 101 out of 117 delegates voting in favour.</p><p> Based on these votes and ongoing negotiations, the parties <a href="https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/volby/archiv/parlamentni-volby-2017/nejnovejsi-informace/kdu-csl-a-stan-podepsali-koalicni-smlouvu">signed</a> <a href="https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/fmfile/0/files/smlouva_STAN_KDU.pdf">a coalition agreement</a> on April 12, 2017. This agreement was subsequently confirmed, and the coalition agreement approved, by the national congress of the KDU-ČSL on May 27, 2017. At which 228 out of 269 delegates present validly <a href="https://kdu.cz/akce/sjezd-2017/aktuality/clanky/celostatni-sjezd-schvalil-koalicni-smlouvu-mezi-kd">voted</a> for the coalition.</p><p> The coalition cooperation was eventually <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/koalice-kdu-csl-a-stan-se-hrouti-lidovci-vyzvali-starosty-at-jsou-jen-jejich-priveskem-34479">called off,</a> mainly due to concerns that the coalition&#39;s election results would not reach the 10% threshold required for the group to enter the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> Although the approval of the electoral coalition between STAN and KDU-ČSL for the 2017 elections was not always supported by an overwhelming majority of the membership base, its participation, albeit somewhat limited, in the approval process of their coalition cooperation cannot be denied.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p></p>
