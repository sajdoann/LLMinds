<p>The competence and appointment process mentioned in the statement are in accordance with the wording of the law and the details regarding the selection procedure correspond to reality (even taking into account the minor numerical deviation, which must be assessed in the context of the statement).</p><p> The process of appointing the Director of the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS) is stated <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2011-341#p1-2">in Section 1, Paragraph 2 of the Act</a> on the General Inspectorate of Security Forces and on Amendments to Related Acts:</p><p> “ <em>The Inspectorate is headed by the Director of the Inspectorate (hereinafter referred to as the “Director”), who is appointed and dismissed</em> <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2011-341?text=f#f4410405"><strong><em>1)</em></strong></a> <em>by the Prime Minister, upon a proposal from the Government and after discussion in the Committee of the Chamber of Deputies responsible for security matters, to whom the Director is accountable for the performance of his/her duties.</em> ”</p><p> The vacant position of head of GIBS was vacated after the institution&#39;s second-in-command, Michael Murín, decided <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/murin-skonci-v-cele-gibs_1804170928_miz">to resign</a> from his position after disputes with Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, who also <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/michal-murin-generalni-inspekce-gibs-andrej-babis-kazenske-rizeni_1803120730_hm">imposed</a> disciplinary proceedings against him.</p><p> He officially <a href="http://www.gibs.cz/zpravodajsky-servis/tiskove-zpravy/rezignace-plk-judr-michala-murina-na-funkci-reditele-generalni-inspekce-bezpecnostnich-sboru">justified</a> his departure by saying that his “ <em>remaining at the head of GIBS</em> <em>could give rise to unjustified questioning of the results of its work.</em> ” 12 candidates <a href="https://zpravy.idnes.cz/vlada-vyberove-rizeni-gibs-reditel-michal-murin-policie-pj8-/domaci.aspx?c=A180629_154404_domaci_bja">applied</a> for the second selection procedure for the post of new director (when the first one was closed due to only one candidate). An independent expert commission subsequently <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/gibs-radim-dragoun-michal-murin-andrej-babis-generalni-inspekce-bezpecnostnich_1807311827_haf">elected</a> Radim Dragoun, the head of the District Prosecutor’s Office in Louny. The Prime Minister fully accepted the commission’s conclusions.</p><p> Given the above, we consider the statement to be true, even though there were actually 12 applicants for the position, unlike the 14 mentioned.</p>
