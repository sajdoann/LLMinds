<p>One of the points of Babiš&#39;s pre-election <a href="https://www.anobudelip.cz/smlouva/">Treaty with the citizens of the Czech Republic</a> was a sharp stance against migration quotas. It is also important to mention that no party in <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/cesko-dal-bojuje-proti-kvotam-na-uprchliky-navzdory-tomu-ze/r~dd56fd0a932411e7a0c50025900fea04/">Czech politics</a> expressed support for the quotas set by the European Union for accepting migrants. Slovakia, Hungary and Romania also expressed their opposition to <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/lidri-eu-dosahli-prelomove-dohody-v-migraci-kvoty-jsou-minulosti-167155/">quotas</a> within the European Union. At the moment, <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/angela-merkelova-uprchlici-kvoty_1806101118_mos">the tendency is changing</a> and, according to the proposal of the Visegrad countries, so-called flexible solidarity in migration policy could be adopted. Individual member states would then have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to accept refugees or whether their assistance would be financial.</p><p> Illegal migration, i.e. legal entry into our territory but exceeding the permitted period of stay, has had <a href="http://www.policie.cz/clanek/nelegalni-migrace-v-ceske-republice-za-rok-2017.aspx">a downward trend in recent years</a> . However, these data are of a general nature and are in no way related to the refugee crisis, in which the Czech Republic was not and is not a destination country for refugees.</p><p> The truth remains that Andrej Babiš outlined priority points in his election campaign entitled Contract with the Citizens of the Czech Republic and defended himself against migration. However, this text cannot be considered the basis for changing migration policy within the European Union. There were many initiatives and pressures in the EU to change quotas and migration policy, and the Czech Republic was also critical of quotas. The biggest supporters of quotas were the countries that were most affected by the migration wave - Greece, <a href="https://zpravy.idnes.cz/minisummit-evropska-unie-migrace-brusel-angela-merkelova-pmy-/zahranicni.aspx?c=A180624_152203_zahranicni_mpl">Italy</a> , Germany and <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/polsko-i-rakousko-jsou-proti-uprchlickym-kvotam/r~c21f628efc4c11e7ad1e0cc47ab5f122/">Austria</a> . However, even within them, the quota policy is being abandoned.</p>
