    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: ...And I was with the admiral who is in charge of Operation Sofia.... We don&#39;t have the permission of the Libyan government, we don&#39;t have the permission of the UN Security Council, so the admiral is operating in that area, but he can&#39;t fight the smugglers on Libyan territory. So what is he doing? He says here that I have destroyed 551 ships and detained 151 migrants. But he will first save the ship and they are not random castaways, according to maritime law. They go there on purpose, yes. And by the way, there are still those non-profit ships waiting there that send signals: come, come, we are waiting. So they have to transport them to the port, the migrants are excited, within two hours, they have already tried it. They will say, well, that&#39;s the smuggler, he was on the ship with us. The smugglers then go to prison and then they destroy the ship. So this is really not like a systemic solution. There&#39;s a mafia here, they only trade in people and even oil and so on.\nSECTION B: And I would like to show the audience that I made a contract with them here before the elections, in October 2017, and I am fulfilling those points. I pledged that we would never allow illegal migrants into our territory and that we would never agree to the distribution of migrants according to mandatory quotas. I fulfilled that in six months, we enforced that, yes.\nSECTION C: The result is that the chairman of the creditors&#39; committee, the administrator, Mr. Monsport and representatives of the cooperative were also there, so a timetable was agreed upon and that both parties would try to find a new expert who would take into account the investment in time of the people who actually live in those housing units.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
