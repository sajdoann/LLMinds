<p>Prime Minister Andrej Babiš <a href="https://www.operationsophia.eu/the-prime-minister-of-the-czech-republic-visited-operation-sophias-headquarters/">met</a> on 28 August 2018 with Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino, who commands the EUNAVFOR MED Operation <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/press/press-releases/2018/05/14/eunavfor-med-operation-sophia-operation-to-contribute-to-better-information-sharing-on-crime-in-the-mediterranean/">Sophia</a> , but his explanation of international maritime law is inaccurate. International maritime law does not recognize the concept of accidental castaway, and under this maritime law, the captain of a ship flying the flag is obliged to provide assistance to any person found on the high seas who is in danger of death. This also applies to <a href="https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/co-delame/migrace-v-souvislostech/zachrana-ve-stredozemnim-mori-se-ridi-mezinarodnim-pravem-3521gp">migrants</a> rescued in the Mediterranean.</p><p> <a href="https://www.operationsophia.eu/about-us/">EU NAVFOR MED Operation Sophia</a> is an EU naval operation established to disrupt the operational model of migrant smugglers and human traffickers in the southern central Mediterranean. Since the start of its active phase (October 2015), the operation has contributed to the arrest of 143 suspected smugglers and human traffickers and their transfer to the Italian authorities, and has neutralised 545 vessels. The operation has also contributed to saving the lives of 44,251 people. Its mandate ends on 31 December 2018.</p><p> The rules of conduct on the seas and oceans are an internationally valid norm, the definition of which is based on the international UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf">UNCLOS</a> ) of 1982. Currently, this agreement has been signed by <a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXI-6&amp;chapter=21&amp;Temp=mtdsg3&amp;clang=_en#1">157</a> states and actors. Libya is one of the first signatories (1982), but the treaty has not yet been ratified. Italy signed the treaty in 1984 and approved it in 1995. For the sake of the image of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, it signed this agreement already in 1982, but without ratification. This took place only after the division of the republic. The Czech Republic <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#Czech%20Upon%20ratification">adopted</a> the treaty in 1996 as part of the solution to access to the sea through neighboring Germany.</p><p> Therefore, when it comes to international maritime law, certain rights and obligations arise for the signatories. One of them is the obligation to provide assistance. This fact is described in Article 98 of the UNCLOS Treaty ( <a href="http://www.windsea.cz/public/Image/sekce-typ-117/umluva-osn-o-morskem-pravu.pdf">pdf</a> ., p.25) as follows:</p><p> &quot; <em>Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, if he can do so without serious danger to the ship, its crew or passengers:</em></p><p> <em>(a) rendered assistance to any person found at sea in danger of life;</em></p><p> <em>(b) proceed with the greatest possible speed to the rescue of persons in danger, if he is informed that they need assistance and if such action could reasonably be expected;</em></p><p> <em>(c) after the collision, render assistance to the other ship, its crew and its passengers and, if possible, inform the other ship of the name of its own ship, its home port and the nearest port to which it is sailing.</em></p><p> <em>All coastal States shall facilitate the establishment, operation and maintenance of adequate and effective search and rescue services for the purpose of ensuring safety at and above the sea and, where circumstances so require, shall conclude regional agreements for mutual cooperation with neighbouring States for this purpose.”</em><br/><br/> The International Maritime Organization (IMO) further elaborates on the internationally recognized procedure for rescue at sea in its <a href="http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/personsrescued/Documents/Resolution%20A.920(22).pdf">resolution</a> number A920 from 2001, where it grants the right to rescue to all in danger of life, regardless of their nationality, status and circumstances that led them to a threatening situation. It also determines that the rescuing ship or ships must transport the rescued to safety and treat the rescued in accordance with IMO rules and maritime traditions. The IOM describes general rules and guidelines <a href="http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/personsrescued/Pages/Default.aspx">here</a> .</p><p> The issue of human trafficking is a highly complicated problem, the growing scope of which is also beginning to be perceived internationally, when, following the latest CNN report, the UN imposed <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/06/1011751">sanctions</a> in June 2018 on several individuals suspected of participating in human trafficking in Libya and called for increased efforts to address this problem.</p><p></p><p></p>
