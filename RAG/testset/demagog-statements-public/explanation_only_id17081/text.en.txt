<p>The current situation in Libya is indeed quite problematic. The political factions seeking to govern are divided by both their divergent interests and their unwillingness to recognize the authority of any one of them.</p><p> This situation could be resolved by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/macron-hosts-libyan-factions-in-paris-in-push-to-secure-elections">the elections scheduled</a> for December 10, 2018; according to the agreement, the parties should reach a decision on the regulations according to which these elections will take place by September 16, 2018.</p><p> However, since the May meeting of Libyan factions, there have been several changes in the influence of individual groups. <a href="https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/why-libyan-elections-probably-wont-happen-year">Confidence</a> in the formation of a stable government and the very promise of elections is not strengthened by previous unsuccessful attempts to establish a unified government and the fragmented political situation in the country.</p><p> Italy has also joined the talks between political groups in Libya. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-libya/italys-pm-conte-sees-no-rush-for-libyan-election-idUSKBN1KT1PH">Giuseppe Conte said</a> he would organize a separate conference to stabilize Libya, with the support of Donald Trump, which could take place in November. Asked about the opinion of Emmanuel Macron, who led the previous agreement, he added that this agreement is in no way detrimental to any previous agreement made by other European countries.</p><p> As for the part of the statement regarding Operation <a href="https://www.operationsophia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Press-Kit.pdf">Sophia</a> (.pdf), it is true that the Czech Republic is one of the 26 participating Member States. The main task of the operation is to cooperate with the Libyan Coast Guard and Navy in maintaining control over parts of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p> However, its effectiveness, according to data for the first half of 2018, is less than fifty percent. According to the Washington Post, the Libyan Coast Guard <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/fewer-migrants-are-making-it-to-europe-heres-why/2018/07/23/80b56082-8c57-11e8-9d59-dccc2c0cabcf_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.128395d0f156">intercepted</a> only one in nine migrants crossing the Mediterranean in 2017. This year, that number has increased to two in five. Specifically, in June 2018, the guard intercepted about 47% of migrants.</p><p> The Italian company Eni S. p. A., the largest foreign <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-libya/italys-pm-conte-sees-no-rush-for-libyan-election-idUSKBN1KT1PH">oil producer</a> operating in <a href="https://www.eni.com/enipedia/en_IT/international-presence/africa/enis-activities-in-libya.page">Libya</a> , which Andrej Babi≈° apparently has in mind in his statement, is controlled by the state, which owns about 30% <a href="https://www.eni.com/en_IT/company/governance/shareholders.page">of the share</a> , but it is currently no longer a &quot;state company&quot;, even though it was originally <a href="https://www.eni.com/en_IT/company/eni-history.page">founded</a> on the basis of law.</p><p> We were unable to confirm or deny the alleged complications with the provision of fuel for the Libyan guard from available sources.</p>
