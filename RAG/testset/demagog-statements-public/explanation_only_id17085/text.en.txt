<p>Given the fact that the current President of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, has neither publicly confirmed nor denied his friendly relationship with Andrej Babiš, we have no choice but to assess this statement as unverifiable. Andrej Babiš remains the only one who has publicly described this relationship as friendly. It should be noted that the two have known each other since their joint meetings as finance ministers.</p><p> The relationship between Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and the current President of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, can be traced back to the times when the two met in <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/node/5930801">negotiations</a> as finance ministers. The common point of their possible good relationship is precisely the area of state finances and Schäuble&#39;s understanding of the different positions of individual EU countries, despite his support for further EU integration, <a href="http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/schauble-musime-lidem-dokazat-ze-evropa-muze-znamenat-rozdil-ptj-/tema.aspx?c=A160806_230532_pozice-tema_lube">the importance of</a> intergovernmental negotiations of EU member <a href="https://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/schaeuble-germany-and-france-could-participate-at-visegrad-four-meeting">states</a> , and, if necessary, practical steps <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1835594-nemecky-ministr-financi-pohrozil-evropske-komisi-ztratou-vlivu-nezacne-li-jednat">regardless</a> of the European Commission. On the other hand, Schäuble also expressed understanding for <a href="https://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/zahranici/evropa/schauble-nemecko-vitanim-bezencu-zachranilo-cest-evropy_358120.html">the reluctance</a> of some countries towards the redistribution of refugees.</p><p> Andrej Babiš himself has described his relationship with Wolfgang Schäuble as friendly or close several times - for example, in an interview with <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/premier/v-mediich/rozhovor-predsedy-vlady-andreje-babise-pro-hospodarske-noviny-165627/">HN</a> on May 18, 2018, he stated the following:</p><p> <em>&quot;We have the same views, for example, with the new German Interior Minister Seehofer, whom I know and I like very much. It is similar with Wolfgang Schäuble, the former Finance Minister, whom I can call my friend,&quot;</em> he added, <em>&quot;Schäuble was previously the Interior Minister and understands that we have a different history of migration, we do not have the multicultural model that exists in some European countries.&quot;</em></p><p> He made a similar statement to the German newspaper <a href="https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/interview-with-andrej-babi-we-have-to-defend-our-civilisation-57111396.bild.html">Bild</a> on September 10, 2018:</p><p> <em>&quot;I think, we have excellent economic ties - and it goes beyond that. Personally, I have a lot of friends in Germany and have just visited my friend Wolfgang Schäuble, whom I came to know in his capacity as finance minister. To me, he has a great personality. Together with the Chancellor, to a greater or lesser extent, we share the same vision of how to solve the migration issue and the Marshall Plan for Africa, based on the Turkish model. However, we have a different opinion on the distribution of migrants on vessels&quot;</em> .</p><p> However, no similar confirmation of a friendly relationship from Wolfgang Schäuble has been found. It should be noted that no publicly available sources indicate that they could not be friends.</p><p> Despite some controversial issues, mutual relations between the Czech Republic and Germany are good, as demonstrated by the last state <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/rozdelovani-bezencu-je-dal-spornym-bodem-vztahu-cr-a-nemecka/1659425">visit</a> of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš to Germany in September 2018.<br/><br/></p>
