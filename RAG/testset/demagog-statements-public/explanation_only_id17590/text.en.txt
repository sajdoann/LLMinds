<p>The Chamber of Deputies&#39; proposals for granting or awarding state decorations, specifically the nomination for the decoration of Karel Sýs, were <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=67755">voted</a> on May 25, 2018. 14 Pirate deputies voted in favor. However, the Pirates later apologized for voting for the state decoration for Karel Sýs. Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Vojtěch Pikal, who admitted his mistake in an interview with iRozhlas.cz, said <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/statni-vyznamenani-2018-karel-sys-basnik-vojtech-pikal_1805261809_ako">the following</a> :</p><p> &quot; <em>I made the mistake of not studying the personalities enough. I relied on the words of the other deputies from the subcommittee. I thought I would have more time to prepare that day. I did not know that I would be presiding over the Chamber and standing in for Speaker Vondráček (Radek Vondráček from ANO), who suddenly lost his voice.&quot;</em></p><p> While Pikal apologizes for not having studied the personalities well enough, Chairman Bartoš talks about the item being put forward and the vote being taken by mistake. According to <a href="http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013121.htm">the shorthand report,</a> the vote was as follows:</p><p> <em>PSP Deputy Chairman Vojtěch Pikal: The next proposal is Karel Sýs.<br/> PSP Deputy Chairman Vojtěch Filip: I have started voting number 96 and I am asking who is in favor. Who is against? Thank you.<br/> Voting number 96. Of the 161 deputies present, 108 voted in favor, 25 against. The proposal was adopted.</em></p><p> Pirates chairman Ivan Bartoš commented on the vote for Karel Sýs in an interview <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/474479-pirat-bartos-nekdy-delame-hlouposti-a-obcas-naletime-ale-jsme-pokorni.html">as follows</a> :</p><p> &quot; <em>Nominations for the award were supposed to be discussed only at the end of the second week, but they were put forward. We had not gone through them. About three names were voted on in the plenary session within one minute, some Pirate MPs noticed the problematic Mr. Sýs and abstained from voting, some followed Vojta Pikal&#39;s recommendation.&quot;</em></p><p> On October 25, 2018, a vote was also taken on <a href="http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013117.htm">a proposal</a> to permanently include item 117 regarding state awards on the same day, and this proposal was <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=67735">adopted</a> . The shortened period before the vote may therefore have had an impact on its outcome, although we cannot verify whether the Pirates voted &quot;by mistake&quot;.<br/><br/> The nomination required 81 MPs to vote in favor. The proposal to nominate Karel Sýs for the state award was approved, with a total of 108 MPs voting in favor, including 14 MPs from the Pirate Party. So even if the Pirate Party MPs had not voted in favor of the proposal, it would still have passed.</p>
