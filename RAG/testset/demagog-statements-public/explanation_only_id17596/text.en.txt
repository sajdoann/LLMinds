<p>A trust fund is, according to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2012-89#p1448">§1448</a> et seq. of the Civil Code, an entity without legal personality. It is created by separating the founder&#39;s property. The creation of a trust fund creates separate and independent property that has no owner.</p><p> Although the ownership rights to the trust fund are exercised by the trustee, it is necessary to be aware that, according to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2012-89#p1448-3">Section 1448(3)</a> of the Civil Code, the ownership rights to the fund do not belong to the trustee, the founder, or the person who is to receive payments from the trust fund.</p><p> It cannot be claimed that someone is the owner of the assets in the trust fund. However, it is possible to infer from Ivan Bartoš&#39;s speech that he is convinced that Andrej Babiš still has a decisive influence on the assets in the trust fund, even though he is not its owner according to the law.</p><p> If this were true, then it could be said that Andrej Babiš is the beneficial owner of the trust fund as understood by Act No. 253/2008 Coll., on certain measures against the legalization of proceeds from crime and the financing of terrorism. According to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2008-253#p4-4">Section 4(4)</a> of this Act, the beneficial owner of a trust fund would be a person who has the factual or legal ability to exercise direct or indirect decisive influence over the trust fund.</p><p> Provided that these conditions are met, there is <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2008-253#p4-4-c">a rebuttable presumption</a> (&quot; <em>it is presumed that&quot;</em> ) that the beneficial owner of the trust fund is, for example, the founder, trustee or beneficiary. For the sake of completeness, let us state that the Civil Code <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2012-89#p1457-1">defines</a> the beneficiary as the person who <a href="https://www.pravniprostor.cz/clanky/obcanske-pravo/sverenske-fondy-pravni-uprava-a-jejich-vyuziti">benefits</a> from the trust fund. This is related to Act No. 304/2013 Coll., on public registers of legal and natural persons, which establishes <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2013-304#p118b">a register of beneficial owners</a> . However, this register <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2013-304#p118c">is not</a> a public register.</p><p> Although the registered data on the founder and beneficiary of the trust fund <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2013-304#p65e-1">are not disclosed</a> without consent, it is possible to conclude that the beneficiary and founder is Andrej Babiš. This is indicated by the publicly available data on the trustees (they are Alexej Bílek and Zbyněk Průša), as well as <a href="https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-podava-prvni-podnet-tykajici-se-stretu-zajmu-andreje-babise/">the findings of</a> Transparency International (see also <a href="http://www.taxparency.eu/cz/structures/#TS4_MAFRA">the graph</a> below, or the table <a href="http://www.taxparency.eu/structures/pdf/TS4_MAFRA.pdf?2">here</a> ).</p><p> In connection with this information and other data from <em>the Register of Public Sector Partners,</em> two<a href="https://www.transparency.cz/wp-content/uploads/Open-Letter-to-the-European-Commission.pdf">complaints</a> were <a href="https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-issues-a-second-complaint-about-andrej-babiss-conflict-of-interest-and-european-subsidies-for-agrofert/">filed by</a> the Czech Transparency International regarding Babiš&#39;s possible conflict of interest. Unlike the register of beneficial owners, <em>the Register of Partners</em> is public and Andrej Babiš <em>appears</em> as one of <a href="https://rpvs.gov.sk/rpvs/Partner/Partner/Detail/7859"><em>the ultimate beneficiaries,</em></a> along with the two aforementioned trustees.</p><p> For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to note that <em>the ultimate beneficial owner</em> is a term defined in <a href="https://www.zakonypreludi.sk/zz/2008-297/znenie-20180315#p6a">Section 6a</a> of Act No. 297/2008 Coll. on <em>protection against legalization of proceeds from crime and terrorism.</em> According to <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-agrofert-sverenske-fondy-premier-transparency-international_1806192243_haf">the statements</a> of the AGROFERT concern and Andrej Babiš, this term is different from the term <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2008-253#p4-4">beneficial owner</a> under Czech law. <br/><br/><br/></p><p></p><img src="https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaXNJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c67f0f037d3f7ce119556aa0fcc8be289a6c9602/TI5_MAFRA_struktura.png" alt=""/><p></p>
