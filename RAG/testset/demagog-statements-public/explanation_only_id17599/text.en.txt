<p>Chairman Bartoš (Pirates) is referring to the amendment to the Civil Service Act. The amendment proposal was <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=132">submitted</a> by the government on March 26, 2018.</p><p> Documents that demonstrate the European Commission&#39;s critical stance on the amendment were published on June 7, 2018 by <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj">the iRozhlas.cz</a> server. Specifically, it is <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf">a letter</a> (.pdf) addressed to the Deputy Minister of the Interior for the Civil Service, <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/vedeni-ministerstva-260932.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Mg%3D%3D">Josef Postránecký</a> . The letter states that, based on a meeting on March 20, 2018, both parties reached a consensus on the need for further amendments to the draft Civil Service Act. The first part of the letter summarizes the commission&#39;s conclusions from the Report on the Czech Republic 2018 ( <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/2018-european-semester-country-report-czech-republic-en.pdf">.pdf, p. 37</a> ). The criticism was directed at the administrative burden resulting from the proposal, the inability to attract experts from the academic and private sectors. The letter also mentions a large number of dismissals in leading positions after the new government took office, which does not correspond to the desired depoliticization of the state administration ( <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf">.pdf, p. 1</a> ).</p><p> This part of the letter is crucial: &quot; <em>We therefore remain concerned about key elements of the proposal. For example, the shift to somewhat lower requirements for second rounds of selection procedures for management positions, the possibility of dismissing managers based on</em> a &#39; <em>sufficient</em> &#39; <em>evaluation result, the possibility of dismissing civil servants based on two performance evaluations within a 40-day period, and the deprivation of managers from the possibility of filing an objection to performance evaluations.&quot;</em> ( <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf">.pdf, p. 2</a> - translation by <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj">the iRozhlas.cz</a> server used).</p><p> The European Commission&#39;s criticism was directed at changes in the evaluation of civil servants&#39; work and the shortening of the period between individual evaluations.</p><p> The extension of the minimum period of 40 days between individual assessments to 60 days, or in the case of an extraordinary assessment after a previous assessment with an <em>unsatisfactory</em> result to 90 days, was presented in an amendment by Kateřina Valachová (ČSSD) ( <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138713">docx, pp. 4 and 10</a> ). Her amendment was <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=68390">adopted</a> .</p><p> Minister Dostálová (ANO) submitted an amendment to Section 60, paragraph 3 ( <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138717">.docx, page 1</a> ):</p><p> <em>&quot;X. In Section 60, paragraph 3, first and second sentences, the words &quot;, State Secretary&quot; are inserted after the words &quot;Deputy for Civil Service&quot;.<br/><br/> X. In Section 60, the following sentence is added at the end of paragraph 3: &quot;A proposal to dismiss the Deputy for Civil Service and the Human Resources Director of the Civil Service Section shall be submitted to the Government by the Minister of the Interior, a proposal to dismiss the State Secretary shall be submitted to the Government by the relevant minister or the head of the Government Office after discussion with the Deputy for Civil Service.&quot;</em></p><p> According to Dostálová&#39;s amendment, the dismissal of state secretaries is therefore possible based on a government decision following the recommendation of the minister, as Bartoš states in his statement.</p><p> The expansion of the scale and conditions of personal evaluation was regulated by the proposal in Section 155 (. <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134549">pdf, p. 24</a> ), among other things, it planned to expand the evaluation scale from 4 to 5 categories:</p><p> , <em>,3) The performance evaluation must contain a conclusion on whether the civil servant achieved in the service</em></p><p> <em>a) excellent results,</em></p><p> <em>b) very good results,</em></p><p> c <em>) good results,</em></p><p> d <em>) satisfactory results, or</em></p><p> (e <em>) unsatisfactory results.”</em></p><p> The proposal therefore implies that the evaluation scale has been expanded. To terminate the employment relationship, it is &quot;enough&quot; to obtain a rating of d) and e), in the words of Chairman Bartoš, &quot; <em>a five or a four&quot;.<br/></em><br/> The initial wording of the draft amendment regulated the conditions for dismissal from service in Section 60, Article 1, Part b): &quot; <em>the service evaluation contains a conclusion that the official achieved unsatisfactory or satisfactory results in service&quot;</em> ( <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134549">.pdf, p. 16</a> ). In this case, no <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138947">amendment proposal</a> (.pdf) was submitted that would specifically change this provision. It can be said that the possibility of dismissing an official from service for a <em>satisfactory (&quot;four&quot;)</em> evaluation thus remained in the proposal, although (as of November 1, 2018) we cannot <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?o=8&amp;v=US&amp;ct=372&amp;fbclid=IwAR1xFaCcnQoQ8hlHnDguF5qbwVymlDT-FybJNQ7rJoXSGHSwBNBtEzdVrus">confirm</a> this with the press, which the Senate should now have. The EC&#39;s reprimand in this case was not corrected by the amendments, and we therefore assess the statement of Chairman Bartoš as untrue.</p>
