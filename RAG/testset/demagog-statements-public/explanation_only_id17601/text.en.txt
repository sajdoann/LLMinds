<p>The government <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=132">submitted</a> a draft amendment to the Civil Service Act to the Chamber of Deputies on 26 March 2018. The amendment was approved by the Chamber of Deputies in the third reading. At the 19th meeting of the Chamber of Deputies on 13 September, the chairman of the Pirates, Ivan Bartoš, <a href="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/019schuz/s019100.htm">questioned</a> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš about the amendment to the Civil Service Act. The Pirates criticize the amendment on the grounds that, according to them, it strengthens political influence in the state administration and may increase the risk of dismissing inconvenient civil servants.</p><p> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš stated in his response to the interpellation: <em>&quot;So you are creating an atmosphere here that we have been doing some kind of purge. When you are not in it and you are a minister and you have a state secretary who does whatever he wants, does not go to work, is antisocial, threatens a mother who has a home office, and we have one like that, a state secretary. And when you have a subordinate who is not working well, who has caused damage, then try to explain to me how we should replace him. And we have been fighting this for a long time.&quot;</em></p><p> He continued: <em>&quot;It is absurd for the minister to be there in the number, for the state secretary to actually do whatever he wants. So that he cannot de facto, if he is dissatisfied with a direct subordinate, so that he cannot replace him. So try talking to Adam Vojtěch, he has probably been in charge there since February. He asked for some disciplinary proceedings and now we are waiting for the highest official. Because the highest official, Mr. Postránecký, is more than the government. More! That is absolutely top!&quot;</em></p><p> The Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, <a href="http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013059.htm">commented</a> on the amendment to the Civil Service Act at the 13th meeting of the Chamber of Deputies on May 23, 2018, where he stated: <em>&quot;I am appearing before you on behalf of a ministry that has long been affected by the highest staff shortage of all central state administration bodies in the Czech Republic. In 2016, it was 65%, the occupancy rate in the ministry. In 2017, I took over the Ministry of Health in a situation where every third employee was missing, when some departments had only department heads without rank-and-file employees. In this complicated situation, I was supposed to fulfill a program, which, however, was slowly becoming impossible to implement with anyone. And unfortunately, it is not possible to this day. When I was looking for the cause of these problems after I took office at the ministry, I conducted a questionnaire among employees, a relatively extensive questionnaire survey, in which over 80% of employees participated. And I am deeply convinced that the main reason for this catastrophic situation in the healthcare sector is the long-term inability to effectively staff manage employees from the highest position in the ministry, i.e. from the position of State Secretary.&quot;</em> He further stated: <em>&quot;I filed a disciplinary complaint against the State Secretary on February 12. The disciplinary committee has not even met to date</em> - <em>and I say again that we are facing a fundamental personnel destabilization and personnel shortage at the Ministry of Health. I therefore believe that disciplinary proceedings are not a completely appropriate tool for resolving the unsystematic, purposeful and often irrational behavior of responsible persons.&quot;</em> He also mentioned in his speech the case where the State Secretary at the Ministry of Health illegally delayed the selection process for the position of Director of the State Institute for Drug Control.</p><p> It is therefore clear from the quotes that both are complaining about the protracted disciplinary proceedings and the impossibility of immediately implementing a change. They are not saying – as Bartoš suggests in his statement – that a change cannot be implemented at all, on the contrary, they are trying to achieve change through specific steps (disciplinary proceedings).</p><p> Let us add that, according to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-234?text=§60#f5357312">Section 60</a> of the Civil Service Act, a state secretary can only be dismissed in cases defined by law (e.g., termination of service, medical incapacity, etc.). In addition, this is possible if &quot; <em>the service evaluation contains a conclusion that he achieved unsatisfactory results in service&quot;.</em> However, such <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/sluzba/clanek/sluzebni-hodnoceni.aspx">a service evaluation</a> is done once a year and if it is unsatisfactory, a new one is done in 6 months. If he reaches the fourth level of evaluation twice, i.e. &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, he can be dismissed, which is also <a href="https://www.mkcr.cz/stanovisko-k-80-zakona-o-statni-sluzbe-163.html">explained</a> in his opinion by the &quot;super-official&quot; Postránecký. Thus, the dismissal process takes at least a year and a half.</p><p> According to Section 60, paragraph 4 of this Act, service also ends on the day the decision on disciplinary action in the form of dismissal or dismissal becomes legally binding. However, it must be taken into account that, according to the Administrative Code, it is possible <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p81-1">to appeal</a> against the decision of the first-instance disciplinary committee to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-234/zneni-20170801?porov=20170701#p93-1">the second-instance</a> disciplinary committee, and only then does the decision become legally binding.</p>
