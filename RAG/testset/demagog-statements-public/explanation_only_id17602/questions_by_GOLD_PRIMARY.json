    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: If we look at the records from the Chamber of Deputies, actually this whole one (the draft amendment to the Civil Service Act, note: Demagog.cz), why is it necessary to do it so conveniently for the government, Mr. Babiš and the Minister of Health argued that they have someone there who they can&#39;t seem to get rid of, which is simply not true.\nSECTION B: TAKÁČ: I&#39;ll stop with those names, Karel Sýs was there too. (...) You supported him. You too, if I&#39;m not mistaken. BARTOŠ: Yes, we did the thing, we explained the thing. There was a point that was put forward, where there was a vote on it and less people voted, and we accidentally voted for Mr. Sýs. However, his, his nomination did not stand up to and did not match the vote of the Pirates, and we apologized for that.\nSECTION C: We are now also participating in the parliamentary anti-corruption group, where there are representatives of all parties, where the legislation is discussed so that there is a consensus. So the so-called &quot;Three Consensus&quot; version has now been negotiated, which will actually allow that if an investigation of the type &quot;I take the Rath case&quot; is underway, journalists would not even be able to write about the fact that this case is ongoing.\nSECTION D: BARTOŠ: (...) in the media power that the (...) prime minister has thanks to his position as owner of the largest media house in the Czech Republic. TAKÁČ: The media house is in a trust fund, it is not owned by Andrej Babiš. BARTOŠ: Well, I have my favorite graphic here, yes, how Mr. Babiš is the founder, the benefactor and owns both funds (...).\nSECTION E: We managed to fix a few things there. The fundamental reservations that the European Commission had about the proposal, that the period for which you have the remedy is being shortened, that the scale of the assessment is actually being expanded, so that you can actually fire the person if they get a five or a four. We tried to fix that with the help of amendments, and that seemed to be successful. However, Minister Dostálová included the amendment that actually allows getting rid of those state secretaries by decision of the government, on the recommendation of the minister.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
