<p>The government <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134598">proposal</a> (.pdf) for an amendment to Act No. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1999-106">106/1999 Coll.</a> , on free access to information, adds the following sentence to Section 2: <em>&quot;The Act shall not apply to the provision of information on ongoing criminal proceedings and persons participating in them, with the exception of information on court decisions on the merits.&quot;</em> (.pdf, p. 28).<em> </em>The amendment to the Act would thus make it impossible to access information on ongoing criminal proceedings under Act No. 106/1999 Coll., including procedural decisions in the proceedings. Therefore, if a question were asked, it would be completely outside the competence of the Act and there would be no need to handle it.</p><p> In the current version of the Act on Free Access to Information <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1999-106#p11-4-a">, Section 11</a> already contains a ban on providing information on ongoing criminal proceedings (i.e. everything up to the decision in the case). The law therefore required that the request be processed in such a way that the information is not provided. However, this rule is broken by the case law ( <a href="http://sbirka.nssoud.cz/cz/svobodny-pristup-k-informacim-informace-o-probihajicim-trestnim-rizeni.p2162.html">judgment</a> no. 1 As 44/2010 – 103, point 36) of the Supreme Administrative Court, which requires obliged entities to consider each individual case and, depending on the circumstances, to allow the provision of information on ongoing criminal proceedings where the failure to provide information cannot be justified by an “urgent social need”. Courts may therefore provide information on ongoing criminal proceedings despite the statutory ban, if the failure to provide information is not necessary.</p><p> According to <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134598">the explanatory report</a> (.pdf, p. 127) of the government amendment, this situation led to &quot; <em>a far-reaching burden on criminal justice authorities, who always had to justify in detail why information could not be provided (if they did not provide it), with difficulties arising from the question of how to argue without using the information itself&quot;.</em><br/><br/> If the government amendment were to enter into force, the obligation of authorities involved in criminal proceedings to provide reasons for (not) providing information during the proceedings, as established by case law, would cease. Only the obligation to provide information on the decision on the merits would be maintained. The public would thus not have access to information on ongoing criminal proceedings and procedural decisions, which are often crucial for the development of the proceedings. According to <a href="http://sbirka.nssoud.cz/cz/svobodny-pristup-k-informacim-informace-o-probihajicim-trestnim-rizeni.p2162.html">the NSS</a> (point 38), providing information on ongoing criminal proceedings is often in the public interest, especially in cases involving criminal acts committed by officials or public officials. Such a case is, among others, the procedural <a href="http://www.ceska-justice.cz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Rath_VS_171016.pdf">resolution</a> of the High Court in Prague in the David Rath case, by which the High Court rejected wiretapping as illegal.<br/><br/> The discussion of the amendment to the law in the third reading was included on <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/ischuze.sqw?o=8&amp;s=20">the agenda</a> of the 20th meeting and should take place on November 14, 2018.</p>
