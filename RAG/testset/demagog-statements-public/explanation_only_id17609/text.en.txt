<p>Bartoš is probably referring to Babiš&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2017-cr/andrej-babis-i/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-13-12-2017-27-06-2018-166989/">first</a> minority government from December 2017 to July 2018, which did not gain <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/premier-andrej-babis-neduvera-poslanecka-snemovna-mensinova-vlada-demise-hnuti_1801161555_haf">the confidence</a> of the Chamber of Deputies. Its draft amendment to the Civil Service Act was <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=132">submitted</a> to the Chamber on March 26, 2018, i.e. 2 months after submitting his resignation.</p><p> Given the terminology (&quot;the first thing the government started to address&quot;), it is more of a figure of speech than a factual statement that it should be the first law submitted. However, it is worth adding that this was not the first government bill since taking <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/prezident-milos-zeman-jmenoval-vladu-premiera-andreje-babise-162087/">office</a> . Between December 13, 2017 and March 26, 2018, the government submitted an amendment <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=46">to the Act</a> on the CNB, an amendment to <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=56">the Act</a> on the Transfer of Ownership, an amendment <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=90">to the Act</a> on the Organization and Implementation of Social Security, or <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=120">an amendment</a> to the Act on Pension Insurance. Even the Ministry of the Interior, as the representative of the proposer, did not submit an amendment to the Act on Civil Service as the first part of its agenda; it was preceded, for example, by an amendment <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=59">to the Act</a> on Elections to the Parliament of the Czech Republic.<br/><br/> In April 2018, the European Commission <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj">criticized</a> the government&#39;s draft amendment to the Civil Service Act. As we read in a letter from European Commissioner for Employment Marianne Thyssen<em> </em>to the Deputy Minister of the Interior for the Civil Service, Josef Postránecký: &quot; <em>We therefore remain concerned about key elements of the proposal. For example, the shift to somewhat low requirements for the second rounds of selection procedures for management positions, the possibility of dismissing managers based on a &#39;sufficient&#39; evaluation result, the possibility of dismissing civil servants based on two service evaluations within a 40-day period, and the deprivation of managers from the possibility of filing an objection against a service evaluation.</em> &quot; At the same time, the European Commissioner notes that the amendment was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in March 2018 and asks to provide analytical materials that led to its form.<br/><br/></p>
