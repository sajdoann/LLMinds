<p>In Kladno, after gaining <a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=1&amp;xdz=8&amp;xnumnuts=2103&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=0">202,233 votes</a> , the Volba pro Kladno party won, as in 2014. It thus won 13 seats in the council, which has a total of 33 members. The party will nevertheless eventually head to the opposition. The parties ODS, SPD, ANO and the Kladeňáci movement <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/volby/volby-2018-komunalni-volby-volba-pro-kladno-opozice_1810071733_dbr">have agreed</a> to cooperate, and according to the coalition agreement, Dan Jiránek (ODS), who has already led the city in the past, is to be the mayor.</p><p> Petr Fiala <a href="https://volby.idnes.cz/kladno-koalice-ods-spd-top-09-hrozba-vylouceni-ze-strany-pip-/volby.aspx?c=A181008_121958_volby_kop">stated</a> through a press spokesman that the situation in Kladno &quot; <em>is not entirely standard.</em> &quot; And further: &quot; <em>As far as I know, the campaign in Kladno was very heated, accompanied by massive anonymous attacks on the opposition.</em> &quot; ODS deputy chairman Martin Kupka also pointed out the heated nature of the election campaign and <a href="https://volby.idnes.cz/kladno-koalice-ods-spd-top-09-hrozba-vylouceni-ze-strany-pip-/volby.aspx?c=A181008_121958_volby_kop">said</a> about cooperation with the SPD: <em>&quot;It is a coalition that I do not prefer, but I understand the arguments that my colleagues</em> (from the Kladno ODS, note: Demagog.cz) <em>presented to the ODS</em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> However, not every party leadership is as tolerant of the formation of a coalition with the SPD as the ODS leadership. <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/okamura-se-raduje-ods-a-top-09-pomohly-jeho-strane-k-vladnou/r~9a3f8512cab611e8b634ac1f6b220ee8/?redirected=1542212809">Petr Hašek</a> , a member of TOP 09 and also a member of the Kladeňáci movement, was faced with the choice of either leaving the coalition or the party. In the end, he decided on the latter option.</p><p> The aforementioned escalation of the campaign in Kladno can be proven by the post-election <a href="https://kladensky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/povolebni-boj-pokracuje-v-kladne-se-mnozi-trestni-oznameni-20181010.html">developments</a> . Criminal charges were filed by both the old-new mayor Dan Jiránek from the ODS and representatives of the former mayor Milan Volf (Volba pro Kladno). However, we were unable to find any concrete evidence that would illustrate the escalation of the campaign, nor any credible information about the spreaders of defamatory news.</p><p> Kladno is not the only city where the ODS cell deviated from its preferred line; in other cases, however, it is primarily about cooperation with the KSČM. In <a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xdz=2&amp;xnumnuts=7104&amp;xobec=513750&amp;xstat=0&amp;xvyber=0">Hranice,</a> a broad coalition (or rather a &quot; <em>working</em> <a href="https://olomouc.idnes.cz/hranice-siroka-koalice-zastupitelstvo-funkce-kritika-opozice-tajemnik-rezignace-gip-/olomouc-zpravy.aspx?c=A181109_438556_olomouc-zpravy_stk"><em>group</em></a> <em>aimed at developing the city</em> &quot;) was formed of seven parties and movements that made it to the council. These are ANO, the association Our Beautiful Hranice, Hranice for Life, Hranice 2000, the communists, the ODS with the support of the Free Democrats, and the SPD. In response to <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/218411030501104#t=4m38s">criticism</a> (video, 4:41) of cooperation with the KSČM, the six-member local ODS council in Hranice <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/mistnim-sdruzenim-ods-ktere-spolupracuji-s-kscm-hrozi-zruseni/1683221">resigned</a> , and the Regional Council <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2644691-hranicka-ods-ma-prijit-o-licenci-duvodem-je-zakazana-povolebni-spoluprace-s">proposed</a> revoking the license of the local ODS association in Hranice. Given that the ODS is resolving the coalition in Hranice (although more in connection with cooperation with the KSČM, which regional cells are prohibited from doing), Kladno remains the only tolerated city with a coalition with the SPD.</p>
