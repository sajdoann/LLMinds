<p>Fiala refers to the political mistake in the statement as coalition cooperation with the KSČM. The ODS banned such a form of cooperation by adopting <a href="https://docplayer.cz/9878146-Xvii-kongres-ods-xvii-kongres-ods-18-19-11-2006-praha.html">a resolution</a> (p. 120) at the 17th Congress in 2006: <em>&quot;The ODS Congress orders the ODS Executive Board to revoke the licenses of local associations that cooperate in coalition with the KSČM at the municipal level.&quot;</em></p><p> The ODS <a href="https://moje.ods.cz/stanovy#clanek3">statutes</a> state in Article 3, point 7, part f) on termination of membership: &quot; <em>Membership in the party terminates: by cancellation of membership by the local assembly or executive board due to a serious breach of obligations set out in section 3.14 of the statutes or due to a final conviction of a member for an intentional crime.&quot;</em> Further in point g): <em>&quot;if the local association terminates and the member does not submit an application for re-registration to another local association within three months of termination.&quot;</em></p><p> In Article 7, point 3, part f), the statutes state that the Executive Board&#39;s powers are &quot; <em>to decide on the establishment (by granting a license) and the dissolution (by revoking a license) of local associations&quot;.</em> In part h), it adds &quot; <em>to decide on the dissolution of membership pursuant to clause 3.7, letter f) of the statutes.&quot;</em></p><p> The Executive Board has decided to revoke the licenses of local associations in connection with cooperation with the KSČM several times. In <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1282064-ods-zrusila-18-sdruzeni-kvuli-spolupraci-s-kscm">2011</a> , the licenses of 18 local associations were revoked. <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1290728-ods-hodla-kvuli-koalicim-s-kscm-zrusit-az-30-sdruzeni"></a> There were <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1290728-ods-hodla-kvuli-koalicim-s-kscm-zrusit-az-30-sdruzeni">30</a> local cells that were threatened with having their licenses revoked due to their coalition with the KSČM in 2011. One of the dissolved local associations was the organization in Rychnov nad Kněžnou. However, as <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/zakaz-koalic-s-komunisty-ods-nepomohl-mesta-ho-porusuji/r~4464b4d4560511e49bec0025900fea04/?redirected=1533021181">the Aktuálně.cz</a> server found out, the cell there eventually reached an agreement with the party leadership and kept its license. This was despite the fact that the ODS members in Rychnov continued to form a coalition with the KSČM. For example, in Týnec nad Sázavou, the party cell was actually dissolved and the representatives continued to exercise their mandate as independents. At the same time, there are known cases where ODS members who entered a coalition with the communists at the local level announced their withdrawal from the ODS and decided to continue in the coalition as independents. This happened, for example, in <a href="https://vary.idnes.cz/starostove-kterym-zrusili-sdruzeni-chteji-opustit-ods-p2j-/vary-zpravy.aspx?c=A110301_095926_vary-zpravy_sou">Aš and Březová</a> .</p><p> The ODS Executive Board dealt with the revocation of licenses from local cells due to coalition cooperation with the KSČM, for example, in 2007, when, according to the <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vykonna-rada-ods-resi-spolupraci-strany-s-komunisty-na-komunalni-urovni_200703312105_mmatusu">iRozhlas.cz</a> server, two licenses were revoked in the Olomouc region. Thus, licenses are revoked from party cells in the event of non-compliance with the resolution from the 17th Congress prohibiting cooperation with the KSČM, although in some cases the license was ultimately not revoked.</p><p></p>
