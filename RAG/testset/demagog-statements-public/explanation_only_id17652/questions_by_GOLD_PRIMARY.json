    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: In some places, the people who made this political mistake ended their membership in ODS. Where the coalition cannot be dissolved, which is always the chance that everyone gets, then steps will have to be taken, such as revoking the license of the local association. These are rare cases.\n\nSECTION B: We are bothered by cooperation with the SPD, and that is why it (massive cooperation, note: Demagog.cz) does not occur. Therefore, there is only one case that I have repeatedly explained publicly and my colleagues from Kladno have also explained, and that is Kladno, where the situation is specific, where it was about choosing the lesser evil under conditions that are clearly given and which mean that no extremist views may have an influence on the governance of Kladno, and it is truly an exception.\nSECTION C: So you said it right, it was we who pointed out certain problems (in the Global Pact – note: Demagog.cz) and we wanted to explain it. The Minister of the Interior, Mr. Hamáček, who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, came and said: &quot;There is nothing wrong with that, it is good, we should support it, certainly, it is the right policy of the Czech government to support it.&quot; A few weeks later, a new Minister of Foreign Affairs comes from the same party and says: &quot;I will recommend that we actually not support it.&quot;\nSECTION D: Here we agreed back then, I don&#39;t know if it was 3 or 4 years ago, on some solution that consisted of creating an automatic system, to compensate for some problems that had arisen in the past. And the point of the solution was that we would never have to go back to that. That simply, depending on the growth of the economy, the salaries would either go up or down.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
