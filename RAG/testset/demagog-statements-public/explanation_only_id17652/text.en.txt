<p>In his statement, Fiala draws attention to the different positions of the last two foreign ministers, Hamáček and Petříček, on the Global Compact on Migration.</p><p> Jan Hamáček defended the adoption of this document during the discussion in <a href="http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/019schuz/bqbs/b20417001.htm">the Chamber of Deputies</a> , stating, among other things: &quot; <em>I will try to explain to the chairman of the ODS club why it is good to have this document, even if it is non-binding.&quot;</em></p><p> His successor, Petříček, however, takes the opposite position. In his <a href="https://www.cssd.cz/aktualne/aktuality/vyjadreni-ministra-zahranicnich-veci-k-rozhodnuti-vlady-ze-cr-nepristoupi-ke-globalnimu-paktu/">statement</a> on the Global Compact, for example, he states: &quot; <em>We should therefore withdraw from the compact negotiation process, as the United States, Hungary and Austria did.&quot;</em></p><p> So Fiala is right: both ministers had different positions on the Global Compact, which is why we consider the statement to be true.</p>
