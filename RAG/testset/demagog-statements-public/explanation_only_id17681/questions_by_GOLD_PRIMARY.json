    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: In our country, this is more visible now because of the case of Mrs. Chalánková, but there are also diverse opinions in other parties, for example on whether or not to support gay marriage or adoption by same-sex couples. Other parties also let their deputies decide on these ethical matters according to their conscience, and not according to some dictated party program.\nSECTION B: Current: Miroslav Kalousek and Karel Schwarzenberg criticized you for agreeing with Babiš, who refused to accept several refugees directly in the Czech Republic. Aren&#39;t you abandoning the values on which TOP 09 stands? Pospíšil: First of all, it must be said that I have never praised Babiš for this. This distortion was brought by Parlamentní listy.\nSECTION C: We are witnessing how Russia is behaving in eastern Ukraine. There is a real military conflict going on there, thousands of civilians, thousands of people have died there. (...) Russia is illegally occupying Crimea. This is annexation according to international law. And its behavior in this area towards Ukraine (...) is clearly in violation of international law. The EU has condemned this.\nSECTION D: The basic problem of the cooperation between KDU-ČSL and STAN was that their mutual agreement was at the level of the party leadership. I am convinced that both chairmen believed in it very much at the time and invested energy in this project. However, it was clear from the beginning that the membership base was not convinced of this project. Our current cooperation in the municipal elections is about something completely different. It was supported by one hundred percent of the members of the TOP 09 regional committee and by over 90 percent of the party members in STAN.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
