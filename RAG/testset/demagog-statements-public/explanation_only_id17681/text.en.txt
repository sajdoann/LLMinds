<p>Crimea was <a href="https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-61891160-krym-a-sevastopol-oficialne-patri-k-rusku-putin-podepsal-smlouvu-o-pripojeni">annexed</a> by Russia on 21 March 2014. The annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia was preceded by a referendum announced by the Crimean parliament, which was held on 16 March 2014. The referendum <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1043406-krym-o-referendum-byl-velky-zajem">asked</a> the following two questions:</p><p> &quot; <em>Are you in favor of the reunification of Crimea with Russia with the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation?</em> &quot;</p><p> &quot; <em>Are you in favor of restoring the 1992 constitution and the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine?</em> &quot;</p><p> However, as has been pointed out (e.g. <a href="https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-61857960-zive-pro-pripojeni-krymu-k-rusku-je-pres-95-procent-lidi-eu-rozhodne-o-sankcich">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/world/europe/crimea-vote-does-not-offer-choice-of-status-quo.html">here</a> ), the difference on these issues is minimal. The 1992 constitution, adopted at the time of the collapse of the USSR, granted Crimea extensive autonomy. Crimea was annexed to Ukraine in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev and had previously belonged to Russia for 170 years.</p><p> Shortly after Russia&#39;s annexation of Crimea, pro-Russian militants in eastern Ukraine <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/donbas-obse-ukrajina-prorusti-povstalci_1808031711_dbr">occupied</a> the Donbas and Luhansk regions and declared two people&#39;s republics. According to Ukraine, Moscow is the military backer of the separatists. Moscow has long <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/donbas-armada/r~94f2eca2880411e7aec7002590604f2e/">denied</a> sending Russian troops to the Donbas. However, in 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/vladimir-putin-admits-russian-military-presence-ukraine">told</a> a press conference: &quot; <em>We never said that there were no people there who performed certain tasks in the military sphere</em> .&quot;<em> </em>However, according to him, this is not the same as sending Russian troops.</p><p> In February 2017, the UN issued <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21730&amp;LangID=E">a report</a> according to which the conflict in Donbass had already claimed 10,090 victims, of which 2,777 were civilians. In 2014, the first Minsk Agreement was <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/EPRS/EPRS-Briefing-548991-Minsk-peace-summit-FINAL.pdf">negotiated</a> (.pdf, p. 2) between Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, but it was soon violated by pro-Russian separatists who seized territory in eastern Ukraine. In February 2015, the second Minsk Agreement was <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1502444-uspesny-minsk-dohoda-na-primeri-i-demarkacni-linii">reached</a> in Belarus, which agreed on a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, an amnesty for all participants in the fighting, and also, for example, a constitutional reform allowing for the decentralization of rebel areas by the end of the year. According to the UN, both agreements are still <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/osn-donbas-civilisti-ukrajina-minska-dohoda-poruseni_1806210808_gol">being violated</a> by both sides.</p><p> The Council of the EU condemned the annexation of Crimea. On 17 March 2014, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/meetings/fac/2014/03/17/">it adopted</a> &quot; <em>restrictive measures against 21 individuals and persons and entities associated with them in connection with their involvement in activities that threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.</em> &quot;<em> </em>The foreign ministers also condemned the Crimean referendum at this Council and did not recognise its result. The Council considered the referendum held to be illegal and in clear violation of the Ukrainian constitution. Since March 2014, the EU has adopted a series <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/">of restrictive measures</a> against Russia in response to the Ukrainian crisis. Most recently, in September 2018, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/history-ukraine-crisis/">it extended</a> the sanctions imposed in connection with the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p><p> The annexation of Crimea is contrary to international law, as stated in <a href="http://www.osn.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/charta-organizace-spojenych-narodu-a-statut-mezinarodniho-soudniho-dvora.pdf">the UN Charter</a> (.pdf, p. 5) in Article 2, paragraph 4:</p><p> <em>4.</em> &quot; <em>All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.</em> &quot;<em><br/></em><br/> As Christian Marxsen of the Planck Institute also <a href="http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf4/Marxsen_2014_-_The_crimea_crisis_-_an_international_law_perspective.pdf">summarizes</a> (.pdf), Russian arguments about protecting the Russian-speaking population abroad or intervention based on invitation will not stand up under international law.</p>
