<p>Part Two of the draft <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf">Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community</a> (.pdf, hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Agreement&quot;) regulates (Agreement, p. 19, Article 10) among other things the rights and obligations of EU citizens residing or working in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens residing or working in European Union countries, as Jiří Pospíšil claims.</p><p> According to Article 12 (p. 23 of the Agreement), any discrimination against these citizens on grounds of nationality is generally prohibited and according to Article 23 (p. 42 of the Agreement), citizens of the Union and the United Kingdom are entitled to equal treatment. According to Article 13 (p. 24 of the Agreement) of this Agreement, the right of residence of these citizens will continue to be subject to European law.</p><p> According to Articles 15 and 16 of the Agreement (p. 27 and 28 of the Agreement), European law will apply to these citizens even in the case of obtaining permanent residence. According to Article 20 (p. 40 of the Agreement), European regulations will apply even when restricting the right of residence or entry (which is currently only possible in exceptional circumstances, e.g. for reasons of public security or public health), but only until the end of the so-called transition period (i.e. until 31 December 2020 – Article 126 of the Agreement), after the transition period it will be possible to restrict the right of residence and entry of EU citizens in the United Kingdom on the basis of British law and vice versa.</p><p> In general, there will be no discrimination between EU and UK citizens and EU citizens may become residents in the UK until the end of the transition period (31 December 2020), with their right of movement and residence governed by EU law to the extent set out in the EU <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038&amp;from=CS">directive</a> , which will also apply to the UK by the end of 2020.</p><p> After the end of the transition period, restrictions on the rights of movement and residence may arise for EU citizens who come to the United Kingdom to obtain resident status, in accordance with Article 20/2 of the Agreement. However, this does not automatically mean that the right of residence and movement of an EU citizen in relation to the United Kingdom will be restricted. This may happen, but it is not certain and depends on the specific legislation of the United Kingdom.</p><p> Much more significant in this statement, however, is the overgeneralization of a complex matter by stating “ <em>they will have the same rights as they would have had if the United Kingdom were in the European Union</em> .” The aforementioned Article 20 of the Agreement regulates only the freedom of movement and residence, not all rights.</p><p> EU citizens who are also residents of the United Kingdom will thus be guaranteed the freedom of movement and residence under EU directives as they have been until now. However, Article 20 of the Agreement does not mention other rights granted by European Union legislation. At the same time, it is highly unlikely that the United Kingdom would maintain all the provisions governing the rights of EU citizens when it is no longer a member of the European Union.</p>
