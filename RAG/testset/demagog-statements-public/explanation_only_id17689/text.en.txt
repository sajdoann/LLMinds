<p>The issue of immigration was used by Brexit supporters during the referendum as one of the arguments for the UK leaving the EU, as shown in their summary articles by, for example, the online <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/22/11992106/brexit-arguments">VOX</a> and the daily newspaper <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/brexit-camp-immigration-economic-vote-leave">The Guardian</a> . The extreme abuse of the immigration topic to gain support is also shown by the well-known <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants">photo</a> of UKIP party leader Nigel Farage from June 16, 2016. </p><img src="https://media.pri.org/s3fs-public/styles/story_main/public/story/images/RTX2I01M%202016-6-27.jpg?itok=Rt_d6D6C" alt=""/><p> The more moderate Vote Leave movement, led by MP Boris Johnson, which represented the main voice of supporters of leaving the EU at the time of the referendum, expressed its views on migration more cautiously. On its <a href="http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/briefing_immigration.html">website</a> , it did not specifically mention any areas or centers of immigration, but generally emphasized the need to gain control over the borders and independence from interference in British migration policy, for example, by European courts.</p><p> Immigration was also the main reason <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-britain-is-in-denial-over-immigration/">cited</a> among people who voted to leave, according to surveys.</p><p> Immigration to the UK around the Brexit <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum">vote</a> (24 June 2016) showed several trends. As <a href="https://vimeo.com/163686248">data</a> from Oxford University shows, migration from the EU increased after the EU enlargement in 2003, fell during the economic recession in 2007–2009, and has been gradually increasing again since then. Nevertheless, the main share of migration to the UK is accounted for by citizens from non-EU countries. The main EU source countries, which have long accounted for the majority of immigration to the EU, are Poland, Ireland and Germany. In the post-crisis period, there has been a noticeable increase from the new countries (Romania, Hungary), but also especially from the so-called southern wing of the EU (Italy, Spain and Portugal).</p><p> It is not true that Central and Eastern Europe itself is the source of the main wave of immigration. Similar results are shown by <a href="http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit05.pdf">research</a> on data from 2015 by the London School of Economics and Political Science. The representation of EU citizens among immigrants (pp. 2–3) is shown in the following graph, which clearly shows the dominance of Poles as workers from the EU: </p><p></p><img src="https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBa0VJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--05b468ae81bbc5ab981b6e319758df0977cd9e72/migrace%20do%20vb.PNG" alt=""/><p> Source: <a href="http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit05.pdf">Brexit and the Impact of Immigration on the UK</a> (.pdf), LSE, p. 3</p><p> The question of whether European workers are taking jobs away from British workers is part of a larger debate within economics, and therefore we do not examine it more extensively. We only note that in the same research the authors also address the question of whether immigration from the EU is taking jobs away from UK citizens or reducing real wages. In both cases, they conclude that immigration from the EU has only a minimal impact on the topics in question, for example, it shows that until 2011 real wages increased with the number of arrivals (ibid., p. 7). The position of foreign vs. British workers was also <a href="http://appgmigration.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/APPG-on-Migration-Brexit_Beyond-the-highly-skilled-report-Sept-2017.pdf">expressed</a> in its document by the parliamentary group on migration, in which all political parties were represented. The group collected information from important interest groups (stakeholders). It states (pp. 5–6) that in some sectors (in less qualified positions) there is a high dependence on European workers, who are more willing to work non-standard working hours and move for work, while British workers are not interested in these positions. He expresses concerns about changes that may reduce the flexibility of British businesses.</p><p> As for the criticism of the current form of the Agreement from the supporters of a hard Brexit, it is aimed at several aspects of the Agreement. Former Brexit Secretary Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/09/09/boris-johnson-compares-latest-brexit-deal-suicide-vest-drawing-sharp-criticism/?utm_term=.d9cfe0ab4ef6">criticizes</a> that May has given in too much to the EU&#39;s demands and is turning the UK into a &quot;vassal state&quot;: too many EU regulations will be maintained and the UK will pay too much in compensation. Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/08/brexit-deal-nigel-farage-says-deal-not-acceptable-business-leaders/">criticized</a> that the European Court of Justice will continue to rule on the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, which he considers humiliating and unacceptable.</p>
