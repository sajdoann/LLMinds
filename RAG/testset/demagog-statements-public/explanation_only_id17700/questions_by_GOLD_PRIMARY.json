    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: Current: Miroslav Kalousek and Karel Schwarzenberg criticized you for agreeing with Babiš, who refused to accept several refugees directly in the Czech Republic. Aren&#39;t you abandoning the values on which TOP 09 stands? Pospíšil: First of all, it must be said that I have never praised Babiš for this. This distortion was brought by Parlamentní listy.\nSECTION B: This is the second part (EU x UK agreements, note: Demagog.cz), where it is clearly stated that citizens of the European Union who still live in Great Britain and who move there by March next year and perhaps even until the end of the transition period (...) will have the same rights as they would have had if Great Britain were in the European Union (...).\nSECTION C: This (the second part of the EU x UK agreement, note: Demagog.cz) is highly criticized by some radical opponents of a soft Brexit, because Brexit was built, among other things, on the fact that populists claimed that citizens of countries from the eastern and central parts of the European Union were coming to us and taking jobs from the British. That was not true, but it was used in that campaign.\nSECTION D: TAKÁČ: Why are you and Mr. Čižinský not on that council? POSPÍŠIL: We have already explained it in detail, even on your television (...), we have clearly said that we are bringing a new style, a new form of government to Prague, we want experts to be on our behalf on the council. (...) I have clearly said that I am ready to be the mayor. The Pirates have clearly said that if they do not have the mayor, they will tear down this coalition.\nSECTION E: We are witnessing how Russia is behaving in eastern Ukraine. There is a real military conflict going on there, thousands of civilians, thousands of people have died there. (...) Russia is illegally occupying Crimea. This is annexation according to international law. And its behavior in this area towards Ukraine (...) is clearly in violation of international law. The EU has condemned this.\nSECTION F: The basic problem of the cooperation between KDU-ČSL and STAN was that their mutual agreement was at the level of the party leadership. I am convinced that both chairmen believed in it very much at the time and invested energy in this project. However, it was clear from the beginning that the membership base was not convinced of this project. Our current cooperation in the municipal elections is about something completely different. It was supported by one hundred percent of the members of the TOP 09 regional committee and by over 90 percent of the party members in STAN.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
