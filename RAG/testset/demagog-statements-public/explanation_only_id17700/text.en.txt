<p>The goal of promoting people with professional experience to the Prague City Council was stated by Jiří Pospíšil at <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2645339-zadni-funkcionari-ale-experti-predstavila-budouci-prazska-koalice-sve-radni">a briefing</a> for the leaders of the Prague coalition on November 7, 2018 (second video, time 4:15).</p><p> &quot; <em>As colleagues have already indicated, we have primarily appointed politicians to the City Council who understand the issues in question. Who not only have some party function in quotation marks, and thus deserve to be on the City Council, but at least for us, and this is also the case for colleagues, we appoint experts to the City Council who understand the professional responsibilities they will be in charge of, and will therefore manage and carry them out better than, for example, Mr. Dolínek (...).</em> &quot;</p><p> Immediately after the election results were announced, representatives of the Pirates and the Prague for Itself movement, out of the three potential coalition partners, claimed the mayoral seat. The representative of the United Forces for Prague, Jiří Pospíšil, stated for <a href="https://praha.idnes.cz/komunalni-volby-2018-praha-vyjednavani-prazsky-magistrat-koalice-pirati-praha-sobe-ods-primator-ciz-iod-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=A181008_431494_praha-zpravy_rsr">the iDnes.cz</a> server on October 8, 2018: &quot; <em>For us, the program is key, the function of mayor is secondary and we are not considering it.</em> &quot;<br/><br/> The Pirates justified their claim to the mayoral seat by the largest percentage gain of valid <a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xdz=4&amp;xnumnuts=1100&amp;xobec=554782&amp;xstat=0&amp;xvyber=0">electoral votes</a> from a potential three-way coalition. The Pirates received 17.07%, Prague For Its Own 16.57% and United Forces for Prague 16.29%. The Prague For Its Own Movement, on the other hand, argued that its leader Jan Čižinský received the highest number <a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv21111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=23&amp;xdz=4&amp;xnumnuts=1100&amp;xobec=554782&amp;xstrana=0&amp;xstat=0&amp;xodkaz=1">of preferential votes</a> of all elected representatives of the capital city of Prague, specifically 80,552.</p><p> Jan Čižinský later stated, according to <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2633327-pospisil-chce-hlavne-koalici-na-postu-prazskeho-primatora-netrva">the ČT 24</a> server, that he no longer wanted to remain mayor: &quot; <em>We are giving up the ambition to have a mayor and, within that, to create a coalition that will be stable for four years.</em> &quot;<em> </em></p><p>Jiří Pospíšil then expressed himself in a similar vein. At a briefing on October 25, 2018, he stated that he was ready to take on the position of mayor. At the same time, he also emphasized that he did not insist on the position of mayor. Pospíšil <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2633327-pospisil-chce-hlavne-koalici-na-postu-prazskeho-primatora-netrva">expressed himself</a> (time 2:25) in such a way that he did not want to endanger the emerging coalition, in which the Pirates insist on the position of mayor, by clinging to the position of mayor: “ <em>The negotiations clearly show that either the Pirates will win the position of mayor, or there will be no coalition. (...) A possible deadlock threatening the formation of a coalition would disappoint a number of Prague residents who want change at Prague City Hall. (...) After long negotiations and long decision-making with our representatives and within our coalition so that it could be established and bring a new political style and a new political culture to the municipality, we decided that we will not insist on the position of mayor.</em> ”</p><p> The leader of the Prague Pirates, Zdeněk Hřib, eventually became <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2649077-hribova-era-zacina-prazska-koalice-podepise-smlouvu">the mayor of</a> Prague.</p>
