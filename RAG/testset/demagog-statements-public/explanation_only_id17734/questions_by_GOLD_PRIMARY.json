    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: This is a specific change to the law that the government approved today, although it is just one word, but it is quite significant because it means that Andrej Babiš will no longer chair the Council for European Funds, (...) which recommends systemic solutions to the government, for example in terms of drawing down European funds, or is responsible for the implementation and the relationship between individual programs and the drawing down of funds for individual program objectives.\nSECTION B: Václav MORAVEC: Well, the Germans were not accused by Russia. Richard BRABEC: No, but we were, we also made a very strong statement. The government clearly said that it was nonsense, it rejected it, even, if I&#39;m not mistaken, Minister Stropnický invited the Russian ambassador to the carpet, where he very clearly told him that this was simply unacceptable. And I don&#39;t think there was any debate about it there. We rejected it, as a government we clearly reject it, it was nonsense, it never happened.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
