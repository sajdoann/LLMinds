<p>Simply put, Brabec says in his statement that according to experts, spruce thrives in a wetter climate than a drier one, and that all experts claim this today. This corresponds to our research in the professional literature. We have reviewed several studies, in which, for example, the following formulations are found:</p><p> &quot; <em>Wiping and dying are affecting spruce stands of all ages, both artificially established and naturally regenerated. The mechanism of damage is not described in detail, but its basic cause is fluctuations in meteorological conditions, which can be linked to ongoing global climate change. The triggering mechanism of catastrophic damage is recurring periods of drought.</em> &quot; (V. Šrámek and K. Neudertová Hellebrandová, VULHM, p. 305, <a href="http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/ZLV/fulltext/469.pdf">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>Spring and summer drought episodes are demonstrably not only a factor limiting plant growth, but also a significant predisposing stressor. Drought increases sensitivity to some biotic diseases (in particular, a higher incidence of vascular mycoses and diseases of the assimilation apparatus can be expected) and also increases the threat from insect pests.</em> &quot; (P. Čermák, VULHM, p. 9, <a href="http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/Sbornik_Budisov_2014_final_komp.pdf#page=11">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>The most vulnerable point in the stability of spruce stands growing in the Czech Republic in lower forest vegetation stages (in the 5th to 3rd LVS) is the disruption of its moisture balance with a direct impact on the soil moisture regime and water reserves in the soil.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(P. Hadaš, LDF MZLU, <a href="http://cbks.cz/sbornik05b/Hadas2.pdf">here</a> ).</p><p> In the studies we searched for, it is repeatedly stated that drought is a threatening factor for the growth of spruce trees. It is not in our power to determine whether all experts claim this, as Brabec says. However, the fact is that we were unable to find a study that would claim the opposite.</p>
