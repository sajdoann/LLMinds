    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: Václav MORAVEC: Well, the Germans were not accused by Russia. Richard BRABEC: No, but we were, we also made a very strong statement. The government clearly said that it was nonsense, it rejected it, even, if I&#39;m not mistaken, Minister Stropnický invited the Russian ambassador to the carpet, where he very clearly told him that this was simply unacceptable. And I don&#39;t think there was any debate about it there. We rejected it, as a government we clearly reject it, it was nonsense, it never happened.\nSECTION B: This is a specific change to the law that the government approved today, although it is just one word, but it is quite significant because it means that Andrej Babiš will no longer chair the Council for European Funds, (...) which recommends systemic solutions to the government, for example in terms of drawing down European funds, or is responsible for the implementation and the relationship between individual programs and the drawing down of funds for individual program objectives.\nSECTION C: If you look at, for example, the dean of the Faculty of Forestry of the Czech University of Life Sciences, Mr. Turčáni, and his statement, he also says that they, as forest experts or some of the forest experts, warned the Forests of the Czech Republic around 2016 that all the conditions for the gradation of the bark beetle, or rather for the unmanageable increase of the bark beetle calamity, were met here, and that there was no adequate response.\nSECTION D: And unfortunately, and all experts agree on this today, many of them have said it before, but they probably weren&#39;t really listened to, they said that in a situation where there is a threat, of course, when, or if there is more frequent drought, there will be long periods of drought, then the spruce, which is classically an ideal tree for, let&#39;s say, a more humid climate, where it still has water, not a lot, but it still has some, let&#39;s say, milder precipitation and on top of that it simply has cold winters, then it is simply, then it is an ideal tree.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
