<p>Marek Turčáni mentioned in the statement is <a href="https://www.fld.czu.cz/cs/r-6823-o-fakulte">the Dean of</a> the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Science at the Czech University of Life Sciences. A statement in which Turčáni states what Minister Brabec attributes to him cannot be found in publicly available sources. However, Turčáni has long been dedicated to the issue of Czech forests and the impacts that climate change will have on these forests and the bark beetle living in them ( <a href="https://home.czu.cz/turcani/publikace">see</a> Turčáni&#39;s publication activities).</p><p> In the Czech Television 90&#39; program (broadcast on May 23, 2018), which dealt with the ongoing bark beetle disaster, Turčáni <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/11412378947-90-ct24/218411058130523-kurovcova-kalamita">states</a> : &quot; <em>At the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Science, we started solving projects funded by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2007 and 2008, where we actually solved some probable development of how the bark beetle here would react to climate change in some way. We published those results in 2011, where it was clear that the bark beetle would increase the number of generations it would produce during the year from two to three. And that is a crucial thing for the negative development.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 21:47)<em> </em>Furthermore, when asked who is to blame, who overslept and did not respond properly to the published warnings, Turčáni answers:<em> </em>&quot; <em>I think it wasn&#39;t a priority at the time because it seemed terribly unlikely to everyone. (...) These results were paid for by the Ministry of Agriculture and of course we provided them all to the Ministry of Agriculture in full. I personally informed Mr. Szorád, the general director of the Forests of the Czech Republic (then director, Demagog.cz note) about this potential danger</em> <strong>.</strong> &quot;<strong><em> </em></strong><em>I suggested to him that we establish joint committees to solve such problems. And Mr. Szorád, the general director, told me that he knew what to do, that he didn&#39;t need any advice.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 23:26) The people of Turčany speak about the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Forests of the Czech Republic.</p><p> In another statement for Czech Television (May 15, 2018), <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1096898594-udalosti-komentare/218411000370515/">he stated</a> : &quot; <em>I can confirm that it did not happen, because in the spring of 2016 I personally spoke with Minister Jurečka, to whom I emphasized that there was a huge, huge problem with the bark beetle, and I urged him to start solving the situation.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 33:40)<em> </em>This meeting was subsequently confirmed in a video by former Minister Jurečka himself.</p><p> Let us add that Turčáni draws attention in his studies to dangerous factors that can lead to an escalation of the bark beetle disaster. For example, <a href="http://lesniportal.cz/downloads/2016/Zprava/Zprava_Final.pdf">he draws attention</a> to the inappropriate composition of the forest in the Czech Republic (p. 25) and the need to prepare for increasing temperatures and droughts (p. 13, 14). He also <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/11412378947-90-ct24/218411058130523-kurovcova-kalamita">speaks</a> about the inappropriateness of the current legislation and the insufficient capacities of the Forests of the Czech Republic, which are unable to deal with the ongoing bark beetle disaster (video from 7:45).</p><p> Turčáni has indeed been warning for a long time about the danger of a gradation of the bark beetle crisis. He repeatedly speaks about the shared responsibility of both the Ministry of Agriculture and the Forests of the Czech Republic.</p>
