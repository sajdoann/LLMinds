<p>According to the Competence <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1969-2#p19-2">Act,</a> the Ministry of the Environment is the central state administration body for nature and landscape protection and forestry in national parks. The Nature and Landscape Protection Act specifies the scope of the Ministry of the Environment and makes it responsible for <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-114#p79-3-j">approving</a> the principles of care for national parks and <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-114#p79-3-d">issuing</a> consent for the use of provisions on pest control.</p><p> The bark beetle disaster in Šumava has its own history. It was particularly <a href="https://prachaticky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/jak-vypada-sumava-11-let-po-orkanu-kyrill-a-nasledne-kurovcove-gradaci-20180526.html">evident</a> in the five years after Hurricane <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2017945-deset-let-po-orkanu-kyrill-lesy-se-vzpamatovavaji-silnemu-vetru-ale-podlehly-znovu">Kyrill</a> , which significantly damaged the face of Šumava in 2007. <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/na-sumave-se-ma-omezit-kaceni-stromu-priroda-si-podle-odborn/r~df5c9dc462e011e5b605002590604f2e/">Originally,</a> a large number of dead trees were cut down and the state tried to actively support the regeneration of forests. Since 2015, a policy <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/problem-s-kurovcem-ma-clovek-ne-priroda-lesy-se-obnovi-samy-zni-z-sumavy-48830">of non-intervention</a> has been promoted, because the opinions that forests are capable of regeneration on their own, without human intervention, are still strengthening.</p><p> The issue of the bark beetle in the Šumava Mountains was discussed on the political scene, especially in 2010–2011, when the bark beetle <a href="http://www.lesmedium.sk/casopis-letokruhy/2016/casopis-letokruhy-2016-12/zkusenosti-z-kurovcove-kalamity-v-np-sumava">affected</a> the Šumava Mountains the most. The political <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/240693-kurovec-nahlodal-i-cssd-sobotka-brani-ekology-zimola-kritizuje.html">discussion</a> mainly concerned the issue of felling dead trees, when the biggest <a href="https://www.cssd.cz/aktualne/aktuality/zimola-kurovec-neni-levicak-ani-pravicak/">critic</a> of the policy of &quot;leaving the forests alone&quot; was the South Bohemian Governor Jiří Zimola.</p><p> However, the claim that the Šumava National Park was not affected by the bark beetle disaster is false. As follows from <a href="http://www.lesmedium.sk/casopis-letokruhy/2016/casopis-letokruhy-2016-12/zkusenosti-z-kurovcove-kalamity-v-np-sumava">the analysis of</a> Martin Klewar from the Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Šumava National Park was hit by the bark beetle disaster: &quot; <em>The disaster reached its peak in 2010 and 2011, when in one year 261,220 trees (2010) and 340,700 trees (2011) died due to the bark beetle in the non-intervention areas of the Šumava National Park, and within the intervention areas, bark beetle wood with a volume of 347,000 m3 (2010) and 242,000 m3 (2011) was harvested. The weight of the attacked trees oscillates between 0.33–6.5 m3 with a mean value of 0.99 m3. The annual increase in bark beetle infestations creates continuous areas in places exceeding a hundred hectares (Trojmezná, Poledník).</em> &quot;</p><p> The bark beetle disaster does not only affect Šumava, but is also <a href="http://www.kurovcoveinfo.cz/">widespread</a> in other parts of the Czech Republic, for example in <a href="https://zpravy.idnes.cz/kde-je-smrk-tam-je-kurovec-kazdy-ale-proti-nemu-bojuje-jinak-poz-/domaci.aspx?c=A110802_152122_domaci_taj">the Jesenické region</a> . As stated by F. Lorenz, M. Knížek and J. Liška (2017): &quot; <em>The most serious, literally critical situation, has persisted for many years in the area of northern and central Moravia and Silesia. The Moravian-Silesian region (approx. 1.46 million m3) and the Olomouc region (approx. 0.64 million m3) are particularly catastrophically affected (in both regions approximately 2/3 of the national bark beetle volume is again recorded)! Other significantly affected regions include South Bohemia (approx. 352 thousand m3), Plzeň (approx. 285 thousand m3), Vysočina (approx. 260 thousand m3), Zlín (approx. 233 thousand m3) and South Moravia (approx. 228 thousand m3).&quot;</em> (p. 13)</p>
