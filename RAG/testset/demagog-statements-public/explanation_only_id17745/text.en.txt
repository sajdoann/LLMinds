<p>The Czech Environmental Inspectorate carries out <a href="http://www.cizp.cz/file/mj8/vyrocni-zprava-CIZP-2017.pdf">inspections</a> every year for the purpose of forest protection, focusing, among other things, on the restoration of forest stands, damage during forest activities (e.g. logging), wildlife, protection of forest soil, and also on bark beetle infestation of forest stands (p. 74).</p><p> The Czech Environmental Inspectorate regularly deals with bark beetles in its annual reports. The annual report for <a href="http://www.cizp.cz/file/wm3/vyrocni-zprava.pdf">2014</a> states that “ <em>the situation is serious in the jurisdiction of the municipalities with extended jurisdiction of Hranice, Lipník nad Bečvou, Olomouc, Šternberk and Zábřeh in the Olomouc Region. On the other hand, the state of insect pests in the Šumava National Park can be assessed positively, where the situation is more favorable compared to previous years.</em> ” (p. 57). In <a href="http://www.cizp.cz/file/kx3/Vyrocni-zprava-CIZP-2015-final.pdf">2015</a> , there was further development of bark beetles in the same area (according to the CEI, the situation is serious), but “ <em>the state of insect pests in the Šumava National Park can be assessed positively, where the situation is more favorable compared to previous years, but an increase in bark beetle wood can realistically be expected as a result of the enormous drought in 2015.</em> ”<em> </em>(p. 69).</p><p> In its <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/sites/default/files/1904048-vz-cizp-2016.pdf">2016</a> annual report, the CEI stated that the bark beetle situation in the Šumava National Park “ <em>has improved significantly compared to 2010 and 2011</em> ” (p. 66). On the other hand, the phenomenon of spruce dying due to lack of moisture and bark beetle infestation in Central and Northern Moravia has been a major phenomenon in recent years, according to the CEI. “ <em>The current capacities of forest protection authorities do not allow for an adequate and comprehensive response to the situation, even when aware that these are primarily tasks for forest owners, professional forest managers and the state forest administration in accordance with the Forest Act</em> ” (p. 68).</p><p> In <a href="http://www.cizp.cz/file/mj8/vyrocni-zprava-CIZP-2017.pdf">2017</a> , there was a slight increase in the occurrence of bark beetles and the volume of bark beetle harvesting in the Šumava National Park (p. 76). “ <em>The disastrous situation in the development of bark beetles in the Moravian-Silesian Region, the Olomouc Region and the Zlín Region is repeatedly unfavorable for 2018, where, due to drought and Wenceslas disease, the very essence of the forest is often threatened.</em> ” In the Olomouc Region, “ <em>according to the CEI, common defensive measures (traps, traps) are not effective. The situation is also worsened by the decrease in wood prices and the associated decrease in interest in bark beetle wood.</em> ”<em> </em>(pp. 73–74).</p><p> Given that more detailed information on the control of bark beetle interventions is not available, we assess the statement as unverifiable. It is not possible to clearly determine from the annual reports of the Czech Environmental Protection Agency whether the conclusions contained in them on the bark beetle situation indicate that the situation would not be manageable or not.</p>
