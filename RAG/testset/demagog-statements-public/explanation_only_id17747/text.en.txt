<p>On December 14, Minister of Agriculture Miroslav Toman <a href="http://eagri.cz/public/web/mze/tiskovy-servis/tiskove-zpravy/x2018_strategie-ministerstva-zemedelstvi-pro.html">presented</a> the ministry&#39;s new <a href="http://eagri.cz/public/web/file/610518/Informace_o_vyvoji_kurovcove_kalamity.pptx">strategy</a> (.ppt) for combating bark beetles in 2019. The strategy also includes dividing the territory of the Czech Republic into three zones according to the degree of infestation of forest stands and the real possibilities for their rescue (p. 6). </p><img src="https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbFVJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f38770825df740a544702deb4300968967475606/rajonizace.png" alt=""/><p> Source: Ministry of Agriculture<br/><br/> Owners will then be granted an exemption so that they do not have to take ineffective anti-bark beetle measures in the worst-affected areas. One of these could be, for example, the possibility of postponing the felling of dry trees from which the bark beetle has already emerged. According to the ministry, this will free up the owners&#39; resources to concentrate felling in places where the forest can still be saved. The exemption will be possible after <a href="https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNB74APJNR">the amendment</a> (.doc) to the Forest Act, which, according to the ministry, could come into force in the first months of 2019. However, the draft amendment to the Act <a href="https://apps.odok.cz/veklep-detail?pid=ALBSB469ZY1H">has not</a> yet been sent to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion.</p>
