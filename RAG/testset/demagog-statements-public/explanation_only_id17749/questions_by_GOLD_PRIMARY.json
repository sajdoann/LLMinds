    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: We have carried out hundreds of specific inspections as the Czech Environmental Inspectorate to ensure compliance with the Forest Act and measures against bark beetles. There were some conclusions from those inspections, I must say that until about 2017 there were no catastrophic conclusions of the type that they would, that they would not be able to handle those things.\nSECTION B: (in the first Babiš government) There was Minister Milek, nominated by ANO for the Ministry of Agriculture, and suddenly we started receiving more information about the extent. We really didn&#39;t have it until then, and then of course we just started a whole series of actions, the government already reacted, a national bark beetle staff was established, regional bark beetle staffs, but we are talking about the turn of 2017/2018.\nSECTION C: The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the forests of national parks and there, although at that time, and you may remember, there was a huge debate about the impending bark beetle disaster in Šumava. At that time, the bark beetle was already eating the commercial forests, where intervention was not only possible, but even necessary, and a number of politicians were dealing with Šumava or national parks, where there was no bark beetle disaster.\nSECTION D: I remember, if I&#39;m not mistaken, sometime in October or September 2017, Minister of Agriculture Jureček presented the government with material that he basically put on the table, it was only a few pages and said that a bark beetle disaster was approaching or that there was a real one. The government then more or less said yes, and set out some further course of action.\nSECTION E: If you look at, for example, the dean of the Faculty of Forestry of the Czech University of Life Sciences, Mr. Turčáni, and his statement, he also says that they, as forest experts or some of the forest experts, warned the Forests of the Czech Republic around 2016 that all the conditions for the gradation of the bark beetle, or rather for the unmanageable increase of the bark beetle calamity, were met here, and that there was no adequate response.\nSECTION F: In my opinion, the Ministry of Agriculture has now proposed a very sensible step, to make a so-called regionalization within the framework of the Forest Act, to divide the Czech Republic into three zones. A zone where, let&#39;s say, there is no point in fighting anymore, because the fight has already been won there, that is, there is no point in cutting down the so-called abandoned lands, where the bark beetle is no longer harmful, because it has simply flown away from there.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
