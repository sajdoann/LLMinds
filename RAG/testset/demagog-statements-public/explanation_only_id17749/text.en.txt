<p>Jiří Milek held the position of Minister of Agriculture in the first Babiš government from December 13, 2017. From January 24, 2018 to June 27, 2018, he held the same position until his resignation.</p><p> The topic of the bark beetle disaster began to be intensively addressed in May 2018, when Milek was still serving as the outgoing Minister of Agriculture. Regarding the disaster, Milek <a href="https://ekonomika.idnes.cz/babis-kurovec-kalamita-0bq-/ekonomika.aspx?c=A180515_145249_ekonomika_div">declared</a> that a state of emergency should be declared. In May 2018, he <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2476441-sef-lesu-cr-szorad-konci-ministr-zemedelstvi-ho-odvolal">dismissed</a> Daniel Szórád, the General Director of the Forests of the Czech Republic, from his position due to neglected procedures. In addition, Milek also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2533975-zvladnout-kurovcovou-kalamitu-potrva-roky-rekli-ministri-chybi-lide-i-chemie">signed</a> an amendment <a href="https://apps.odok.cz/veklep-detail?p_p_id=material_WAR_odokkpl&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-1&amp;p_p_col_count=3&amp;_material_WAR_odokkpl_pid=ALBSAWVBAG8N&amp;tab=detail">to the decree</a> on forest protection.</p><p> Milek also <a href="https://ekonomika.idnes.cz/babis-kurovec-kalamita-0bq-/ekonomika.aspx?c=A180515_145249_ekonomika_div">said</a> that there is a need for greater cooperation with the Ministry of Transport regarding the transportation of harvested wood by rail. The Ministry of Industry and Trade should then regulate the wood market and the Ministry of the Interior would contribute by deploying firefighting equipment. Finally, Milek suggested cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding increasing the number of foreign workers.</p><p> During Milk&#39;s tenure, it was decided to <a href="http://eagri.cz/public/web/mze/tiskovy-servis/aktualne/ministerstva-a-kraje-se-dohodly-na.html">establish</a> regional disaster response teams at a joint meeting with Richard Brabec and the Association of Regions of the Czech Republic held on June 21, 2018. The regional disaster response teams are tasked with ensuring the acceleration of cooperation between ministries and regions; they should also cooperate with municipalities with extended powers, for example.</p><p> However, cooperation with ministries and increasing the number of foreign workers had already been addressed in the past by Milka&#39;s predecessor, Marian Jurečka. He <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/marian-jurecka-115397/">served</a> as Minister of Agriculture in Sobotka&#39;s government from January 29, 2014, and as a minister in resignation from December 5 to 13, 2017.<br/><br/> Already in March 2016, foresters <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/cesku-podle-lesniku-hrozi-nejhorsi-kurovcova-kalamita-za-poslednich-20-let_201603131123_jpiroch">predicted</a> a massive bark beetle disaster. The then Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Patrik Mlynář, commented on the topic for iRozhlas.cz: <em>&quot;We expect bark beetle degradation to be up to three times worse than last year. We will offer owners and processors a certain option and prepare a subsidy title that would help the wood market if there is more wood on the market than last year.&quot;</em></p><p> The Ministry of Agriculture, still under the leadership of Marian Jurečka, reported on the 50% increase in timber harvesting due to the insect disaster, for example, in <a href="http://eagri.cz/public/web/mze/tiskovy-servis/tiskove-zpravy/x2017_ministerstvo-zemedelstvi-kalamitni-drivi.html">a press release</a> from November 7, 2017. It also reported on the issuance of a regulation under which forest owners were obliged to remove wood infested with bark beetles by March 2018. At the same time, the ministry&#39;s regulation <a href="https://www.lidovky.cz/domov/zakaz-umyslne-tezby-dreva-ministerstvo-chce-aby-se-zpracovavalo-drivi-z-kalamit.A170914_103647_ln_domov_ELE">introduced</a> a ban on harvesting wood not infested with bark beetles or not affected by the wind disaster.</p><p> Jurečka also told <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/smrky-ekologie-lesy-v-cesku-kurovec-ekologie_1806051748_dbr">iRozhlas.cz</a> on June 5, 2018, that he had tried to cooperate with the ministries of the interior, transport, and trade in the government, but was unsuccessful in his request for cooperation. According to <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-kurovec-ministerstvo-zemedelstvi-kalamita-lesy-cr_1805151540_dp">iRozhlas.cz</a> , Andrej Babiš stated that Jurečka was directly tasked with negotiating cooperation between the ministries in the government in September 2017.</p><p> Regarding the increase in the workforce, according to <a href="https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-65852380-vlada-zjednodusi-zamestnavani-pracovniku-z-ukrajiny-v-zemedelstvi-projekt-zacne-od-pristiho-roku">media reports</a> , Minister Jureček managed to release 1,500 work visas for foreign workers in agriculture, although the Agrarian Chamber originally requested up to 15,000 new people. However, the reports do not clearly indicate that the intention was to achieve an influx of workers due to the bark beetle disaster, on the contrary, the current Minister of Agriculture Toman <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2533975-zvladnout-kurovcovou-kalamitu-potrva-roky-rekli-ministri-chybi-lide-i-chemie">is calling</a> for an additional 6,000 workers for logging. Jureček&#39;s successor, Milek, also <a href="https://ekonomika.idnes.cz/babis-kurovec-kalamita-0bq-/ekonomika.aspx?c=A180515_145249_ekonomika_div">spoke</a> about the fact that the workforce should be increased by workers from abroad.</p><p> Jurečka then told Seznam zprávy that, in addition to increasing the workforce for logging, he had taken other necessary steps as a minister during the bark beetle disaster. He tasked the Forests of the Czech Republic with logging the infested trees, ensured a denser distribution of pheromone traps, an information portal for private and municipal forest owners, and appealed to the Ministry of Transport, requesting a higher number of railway wagons for transporting wood ( <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/radil-jsem-nastupci-co-musi-udelat-kvuli-kurovci-neposlechl-brani-se-byvaly-ministr-zemedelstvi-jurecka-47199">video</a> , time 0:55-1:56).</p>
