<p>Compulsory voting was introduced by Act No. <a href="http://ftp.aspi.cz/opispdf/1920/027-1920.pdf">123/1920</a> Coll. (.pdf, pp. 275, 283). The following persons were exempt from compulsory voting:</p><ul><li> were over 70 years old, or</li><li> were unable to appear at the polling station due to illness or physical disability, or</li><li> were unable to attend the elections due to urgent obligations of their office or profession, or</li><li> were at least 100 km away from the polling place on election day, or</li><li> were delayed by traffic disruptions or other insurmountable obstacles</li></ul><p> Unexcused attendance was punishable by a fine of 20 to 5,000 CZK or imprisonment of 1 day to 1 month.</p><p> After World War II, compulsory voting was again established in Act No.<a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1946-67"></a> <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1946-67">67/1946</a> Coll. The amendment of the law was almost identical to the law from the First Republic, only the possibility of casting a so-called white ballot (not voting for any party) was added. The same conditions for compulsory voting are also stated in <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1948-75#p16">the Election Act</a> of 1948. This Act was repealed by Act No. <a href="http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1954-27">27/1954</a> Coll., which removed the obligation to vote. Thus, compulsory voting did not formally exist from mid-1954, yet according to <a href="https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/20536128/422008p7_3.pdf/e12cd508-ad65-44f6-ae0e-99d2491a49ae?version=1.0">data</a> from the Czech Statistical Office, voter turnout did not fall below 99% until the 1990 elections.</p><p> The Communists did not introduce compulsory voting in the true sense of the word, they merely took over an earlier law that had been in effect since 1920 (or 1946). They eventually repealed the electoral law in this form.<br/></p>
