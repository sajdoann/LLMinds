    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: And then there is Libya. That is the biggest problem. There is not actually one government there, there are elections coming up, the Libyan guard, which we helped as part of Operation Sofia, is very effective. It is holding the ships, 84% and they didn&#39;t have oil in August. So Prime Minister Conte was dealing with oil, because it is a state-owned company, but the government was not able to force them to give the Libyan guard oil so that they could hold the ships.\nSECTION B: ...and I discussed it with him (Wolfgang Schäuble - note: Demagogue) and he always understood us, he saw it at the press conference and said yes, here is the Czech Republic, and the V4 have a different history, they don&#39;t have the multicultural model and we don&#39;t want it, because the foreigners haven&#39;t been integrated in the individual states. \nSECTION C: On April 24, a petition demanding Stanek&#39;s dismissal was created, and on April 28, the vice-chairman of the ČSSD Onderka began demanding the dismissal of his own minister, contrary to the position of his own chairman. On May 2, I received the petition signatories at the Government Office, and Mr. Hamáček, who stood up for Stanek, was also at the meeting with them.\n\nSECTION D: ...And I was with the admiral who is in charge of Operation Sofia.... We don&#39;t have the permission of the Libyan government, we don&#39;t have the permission of the UN Security Council, so the admiral is operating in that area, but he can&#39;t fight the smugglers on Libyan territory. So what is he doing? He says here that I have destroyed 551 ships and detained 151 migrants. But he will first save the ship and they are not random castaways, according to maritime law. They go there on purpose, yes. And by the way, there are still those non-profit ships waiting there that send signals: come, come, we are waiting. So they have to transport them to the port, the migrants are excited, within two hours, they have already tried it. They will say, well, that&#39;s the smuggler, he was on the ship with us. The smugglers then go to prison and then they destroy the ship. So this is really not like a systemic solution. There&#39;s a mafia here, they only trade in people and even oil and so on.\nSECTION E: Look at how we are increasing pensions. Here we are, the coalition government, we haven&#39;t had time yet. And here we are, 2018, 475 crowns and this is the proposal of the minority government of the ANO movement. That, my government, which ruled brilliantly for 205 days, without confidence, but it worked perfectly, is increasing 918 crowns on average per month and another 1,000 crowns for pensioners aged 85. \nSECTION F: And I would like to show the audience that I made a contract with them here before the elections, in October 2017, and I am fulfilling those points. I pledged that we would never allow illegal migrants into our territory and that we would never agree to the distribution of migrants according to mandatory quotas. I fulfilled that in six months, we enforced that, yes.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
