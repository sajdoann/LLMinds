<p>The petition &quot;Uncultured Minister&quot; addressed to Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and Chairman of the ČSSD Jan Hamáček was created in Prague on <a href="https://www.nekulturniministr.cz/">April 24,</a> 2019. The signatories call on the Prime Minister to propose to the President of the Republic the dismissal of Antonín Staněk from the position of Minister of Culture. They then ask Chairman Hamáček that the ČSSD, as a coalition partner of ANO, support the dismissal of Antonín Staněk from the position of Minister of Culture. According to the authors of the petition, Minister Staněk should be dismissed <a href="https://www.nekulturniministr.cz/">due to</a> <strong>&quot;</strong> <em>incompetence, loss of trust and failure (...) in the position of the highest government representative in the field of culture.&quot;</em> The initiators and signatories of the petition subsequently <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/pr/index_view.php?id=1751827">granted</a> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš&#39;s request for a meeting. They presented their demands to him <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/petice-proti-ministru-kultury-stankovi-babis-hamacek.A190502_213523_domaci_cern">on May 2</a> at the Government Office.

In the event that Minister Staněk does not justify his actions, according to Onderka, it is appropriate for the Social Democrats to consider a replacement within this ministry. Therefore, it is not true that he would directly demand Staněk&#39;s resignation.<em> </em>Two days earlier, Minister Staňek was supported by the chairman of the ČSSD, Hamáček: &quot; <em>I am not planning a change in the post of Minister of Culture,&quot;</em> <a href="https://denikn.cz/minuta/117249/">he wrote to</a> Deník N at the time.</p><p> From <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/onderka-prezident-uz-mel-stanka-odvolat-ustava-neni-trhaci-k/r~20d3961e9e6411e9b7740cc47ab5f122/">the interview</a> of the vice-chairman of the ČSSD, Roman Onderka, for Aktuálně.cz on July 4, 2019, it is clear that he does not like his name being associated with the demand for the resignation of Minister Staněk. When asked by the editor whether Minister of Culture Staněk should leave the government, Onderka replied: &quot; <em>Mr. Moravec asked me if steps were being taken to dismiss Mr. Staněk. I said yes, but it was not as the headlines said, that Onderka wanted to dismiss Staněk.&quot;</em></p>
