<p>After Jan Mládek&#39;s <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/11412378947-90-ct24/217411058130220/obsah/525285-odvolani-jana-mladka-uvod">dismissal</a> from the post of Minister of Industry and Trade, announced by Bohuslav Sobotka on February 20, 2017, Tomáš Prouza was considered one of the potential candidates for the post of Minister. When asked whether Miloš Zeman would have any reservations if Bohuslav Sobotka proposed Prouza as the new Minister of Industry and Trade, the President replied: <em>&quot;First of all, I would ask whether Mr. Prouza knows anything about Czech industry at all.&quot;</em> The President&#39;s spokesman, Jiří Ovčáček, also <a href="https://echo24.cz/a/w5sWy/ovcacek-prouza-ma-blizko-k-organizacim-utocicim-na-zemana">expressed his</a> negative opinion against Prouza on his Twitter: <em>&quot;He is famous for his close relationship with political non-profit organizations that purposefully attack the President and feed on</em> the &#39; <em>fight against propaganda</em> &#39; <em>.&quot;</em> <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sobotka-se-ted-nechtel-stretnout-s-prezidentem-rikaji-social/r~e36f0374fa9311e6b2310025900fea04/">Aktualne.cz</a> also reported that Sobotka does not want a clash with the President.</p><p> The Czech Justice website also <a href="https://www.ceska-justice.cz/blog/nejmenovani-ministra/">confirms</a> that then-Prime Minister Sobotka first informally proposed Tomáš Prouz to the president for the post of Minister of Industry and Trade, after which the president rejected him.</p><p> After a meeting with President Bohuslav Sobotka on February 25, 2017, <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sobotka-se-ted-nechtel-stretnout-s-prezidentem-rikaji-social/r~e36f0374fa9311e6b2310025900fea04/">he announced</a> that he would temporarily lead the ministry himself. In early March, Tomáš Prouza <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/tomas-prouza-konci-ve-funkci-namestka-pro-evropske-zalezitos/r~6f7dcf7c003311e781eb0025900fea04/">resigned</a> from his position as Deputy Head of the European Affairs Section at the Government Office and left for the private sector.</p><p> On 5 May 2017, Bohuslav Sobotka proposed <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2109644-sobotka-si-demisi-nakonec-rozmyslel-na-hrad-poslal-navrh-s-odvolanim-babise">the dismissal</a> of Andrej Babiš from the post of Minister of Finance, after a previous unsuccessful attempt to submit the resignation of the entire government, due to Babiš&#39;s case of purchasing crown bonds and uncertainties regarding the acquisition of his property. Miloš Zeman was <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/politika/zeman-se-dnes-seznami-s-navrhem-na-odvolani-babise/r~fc54753a33b511e7a70b002590604f2e/">reluctant</a> <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/vladni-krize-babis-sobotka-zeman-otocky-zmeny-postoju-prehled.A170517_113104_domaci_jw">to dismiss</a> Andrej Babiš - on 5 May, Hrad <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2109644-sobotka-si-demisi-nakonec-rozmyslel-na-hrad-poslal-navrh-s-odvolanim-babise">stated</a> that Andrej Babiš could not be dismissed because it would violate the coalition agreement, and on 11 May in Doksy <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/vladni-krize-babis-sobotka-zeman-otocky-zmeny-postoju-prehled.A170517_113104_domaci_jw"></a> the president indicated that it would be acceptable if both Prime Minister Sobotka and then Minister Babiš left the government. Andrej Babiš indeed admitted on May 6 that he would leave the government and that he had a possible successor selected, namely Alena Schillerová, which Sobotka rejected. Subsequently, Ivan Pilný was <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/navrh-na-jmenovani-pilneho-ministrem-misto-babise-dorazil-na-hrad.A170518_100404_domaci_kop">proposed to</a> replace Andrej Babiš, with whom Prime Minister Sobotka agreed and therefore sent the president a proposal to dismiss Andrej Babiš from the post of Minister of Finance together with a proposal to appoint Ivan Pilný in his place.</p><p> It is therefore not true that Andrej Babiš resigned from his post. The then Finance Minister Babiš was <a href="https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-65741440-babis-dorazil-na-hrad-zeman-ho-odvola-z-funkce-odchodu-z-vlady-nelituji-vztahy-v-ni-jsou-narusene-rekl-koncici-ministr">dismissed</a> by the president at the suggestion of Prime Minister Sobotka, after previous disputes between Bohuslav Sobotka and the president and Andrej Babiš himself over his successor.</p>
