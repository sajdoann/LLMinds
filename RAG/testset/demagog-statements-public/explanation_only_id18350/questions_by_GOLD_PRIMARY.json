    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: So you said it right, it was we who pointed out certain problems (in the Global Pact – note: Demagog.cz) and we wanted to explain it. The Minister of the Interior, Mr. Hamáček, who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, came and said: &quot;There is nothing wrong with that, it is good, we should support it, certainly, it is the right policy of the Czech government to support it.&quot; A few weeks later, a new Minister of Foreign Affairs comes from the same party and says: &quot;I will recommend that we actually not support it.&quot;\nSECTION B: It was not easy for ODS, as a strong party and a long-term traditional party in the Czech political system, not to field a candidate in all 27 districts, and we did it anyway, we did not field one, sometimes we made an agreement, we supported someone else, and what did it ultimately lead to, weakening ODS? No, strengthening it. We won the Senate elections by a landslide.\nSECTION C: We are bothered by cooperation with the SPD, and that is why it (massive cooperation, note: Demagog.cz) does not occur. Therefore, there is only one case that I have repeatedly explained publicly and my colleagues from Kladno have also explained, and that is Kladno, where the situation is specific, where it was about choosing the lesser evil under conditions that are clearly given and which mean that no extremist views may have an influence on the governance of Kladno, and it is truly an exception.\nSECTION D: Well, for the same reason that debates about the global pact are taking place in most European countries today. (...) There are a number of reasons (for not signing the Global Migration Pact – note: Demagog.cz). In addition to a certain vagueness of the formulations contained in the global pact, there is also a certain danger that the distinction between legal and illegal migration is no longer made. Between economic migration and migration that is truly caused by an attempt to save one&#39;s life.\nSECTION E: In some places, the people who made this political mistake ended their membership in ODS. Where the coalition cannot be dissolved, which is always the chance that everyone gets, then steps will have to be taken, such as revoking the license of the local association. These are rare cases.\n\nSECTION F: I set a goal for us (ODS, note: Demagog.cz) to always have 50% more in every election in the same type of election, which is no small ambition, we are doing well, in the last European elections we even exceeded that, when I look at the last elections that were held here, municipal, senate, we significantly strengthened, we clearly won in the senate elections, when I look at the European elections, we were second, we doubled the number of mandates, we tripled the number of votes. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
