    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: Well, I recommended quite publicly when he was appointed (Minister of Culture Zaor√°lek, note: Demagog.cz) that he realize that he can have a comfortable life, going from reception to reception, from opening to opening, from festival to festival, but that the Ministry of Culture should take care of dilapidated cultural monuments.\nSECTION B: So I have problems with compulsory voting. I&#39;ll ignore the stupid argument that the communists introduced it. By the way, you know, right? On the contrary, they abolished Masaryk&#39;s law on compulsory voting and formally and only formally, voting was not compulsory. But something else is that under the communists, voting was enforced quite drastically, although not by law.\n\n\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
