<p>On September 17, 2019, an interview with Radka Maxová was published on the website <a href="https://denikn.cz/198131/na-socialni-sluzby-penize-nejsou-ale-nasla-se-miliarda-na-kurovce-rika-maxova-v-ano-zustava-kvuli-pracovitym-lidem/">denikn.cz</a> , where she was asked, among other things, about her opinion on the suspension of the prosecution of Andrej Babiš. We were unable to find any other media outlets discussing this topic with MEP Maxová.</p><p> The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/OJ-9-2019-09-16-SYN_CS.html">Strasbourg</a> meeting took place from 16 to 19 September, and on none of the days was there any topic related to Andrej Babiš on the agenda. As for the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/EMPL-PV-2019-09-24-1_EN.pdf">Brussels</a> meeting, on 24 September there was a meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which Radka Maxová probably has in mind. The minutes also do not mention the discussion of the topic of Prime Minister Babiš and the suspension of his criminal prosecution.</p>
