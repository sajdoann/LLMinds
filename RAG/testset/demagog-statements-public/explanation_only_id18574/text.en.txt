<p><a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-intergroup-european-parliament">The Disability Intergroup</a> is an informal group of Members of the European Parliament interested in supporting people with disabilities and their rights. This “intergroup” is one of the oldest, first established in 1980.</p><p> After the last elections to the European Parliament, an initiative was taken <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/newsroom/news/european-disability-movement-calls-reestablishment-disability-intergroup-european">to revive</a> this group in the new composition of the Parliament. The exact sequence of events and negotiations between the EU Disability Forum (EDF, an umbrella organization that helps people with disabilities) and the MEPs is not available, but Radka Maxová, who attended the negotiations and supports the establishment of the group, can also be considered the initiator of the establishment of the Disability Intergroup in the European Parliament.</p><p> If Maxová is talking in her statement about the MPs she managed to recruit for this group, or about the date of the group&#39;s establishment, then we were unable to verify these parts of the statement from public sources. Information about the negotiations on the group is only provided by posts on the social networks of MEP Maxová and EDF. Only the following two posts mention the creation of the aforementioned Disability Intergroup: </p><div><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fradka.maxova.1%2Fposts%2F2417964951767893&width=500" width="500" height="584" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div><div><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FEuropeanDisabilityForumEDF%2Fposts%2F2545439382145973&width=500" width="500" height="830" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div><p> The contributions prove the meetings of MEPs (including Maxová) with EDF, the content of which is the planned creation of the Disability Intergroup.</p><p> Information on the current number of signatures and representation of all committees is not publicly available anywhere. The group&#39;s <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-intergroup-european-parliament">website</a> only provides <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/sites/default/files/disability_intergroup-mep_support_form_0.pdf">a form</a> (.pdf) for MEPs to express their support for the group&#39;s establishment for the years 2019–2024. The same website also provides <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/sites/default/files/disability_intergroup_meps_list_-_update_october_2018.xls">a list</a> (.xls) of the group&#39;s supporters, but this is for the previous period (2014–2019), not the one currently being negotiated.</p>
