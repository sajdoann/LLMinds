<p>The proposal to increase parental allowance <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=490">passed</a> its second reading in the Chamber of Deputies on 25 September 2019. It is intended <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=161461">to increase</a> (.pdf, p. 2, point 4) parental allowance by 80 thousand, from 220 thousand to 300 thousand crowns. In addition, the European Parliament Directive on work-life balance for parents and carers <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158">was passed</a> on 20 June 2019. This directive is to be implemented by 2 August 2022 in all Member States (Article 20) and, for example, extends the length of paternity leave to 10 days, which is an extension of <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/otcovska-dovolena-se-prodlouzi-na-deset-dnu/r~03b973acb82f11e9b16b0cc47ab5f122/">three</a> days.</p><p> As for the change in maternity leave, MEP Maxová probably means the changes described in Article 5 of this <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158">directive</a> . According to it, each parent is entitled to 4 months of parental leave. Two of these months are non-transferable and, according to Article 8, also paid. According to the directive, parental leave can also be conditioned by the total time worked or the duration of the employment relationship. However, this period may not exceed 1 year.</p><p> In response to this directive and the increase in parental allowance, Radka Maxová has already expressed herself in the past and even then demanded a systemic <a href="https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/radka-maxova-rodice-volaji-hlavne-po-moznostech-skloubeni-pracovniho-a-rodinneho-7801534">change</a> (video 10:40): &quot; <em>We wanted Minister Maláčová to say that if we were going to add this amount, then there needed to be a systemic change in the support for families from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. And that maybe we could talk about, could talk about, postponing the increase. So that it would be combined with work and private life, with the financing of children&#39;s groups, actually with the relationship to the directive that will be approved by the European Parliament</em> .&quot;</p><p> However, there has been no systemic change, i.e. a comprehensive amendment that would comprehensively regulate the individual institutions supporting working parents, including, for example, in connection with the aforementioned European directive. Individual areas are therefore amended separately, within separate amendments.</p><p> In addition to the amount of parental allowance, adjustments are also expected for children&#39;s groups. Children&#39;s groups <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/deti-jesle-platit-skupiny-prispevky.A190522_093831_domaci_elz">are</a> places where children can be placed before starting kindergarten. There are currently 959 of these places in the Czech Republic with a capacity of over 14 thousand children. However, these children&#39;s groups are paid for from European funds, which will end after 2020 (groups that have applied for this will be funded until 2022).</p><p> The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs wants children&#39;s groups to be paid for from the state budget from <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2931710-jesle-se-vraci-malacova-chce-prejmenovat-detske-skupiny-a-hradit-je-z-rozpoctu">2021</a> .</p><p> With the support of workers, one can also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske">imagine</a> the emergence of part-time work. In the European Union, the Czech Republic <a href="https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-66249480-zapad-eu-valcuje-vychodni-zeme-bloku-v-podilu-lidi-pracujicich-na-zkraceny-uvazek-cesko-je-ve-srovnani-mezi-poslednimi">is</a> among the countries with a lower popularity of part-time work. The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/jana-malacova-mpsv-castecny-uvazek-novela-zakonik-prace_1907161848_per">expressed</a> a positive opinion on part-time work and stated that she is preparing an amendment to the Labor Code, which would include, among other things, the establishment of a shared job, which should support part-time work so that people can more easily have, for example, a twenty-hour workday.</p><p> VAT on home childcare services is also to <a href="https://www.finance.cz/527687-nizsi-dph-u-piva-holicky/">be reduced</a> , which is another item that Radka Maxová <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske">mentioned</a> in the context of increasing the parental allowance. However, the VAT reduction <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2019/novela-zakona-o-evidenci-trzeb-miri-do-t-34995">does not</a> include tax on children&#39;s needs.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because all the above-mentioned changes were not linked together. This procedure can therefore be described as non-systematic, given that the individual amendments are being prepared gradually and independently of each other. The situation will also be affected by the European Parliament directive, which is to be implemented by August 2022, children&#39;s groups will then be funded by the state possibly from 2021, but the so-called micro-nurseries ( <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2741900-na-mikrojeslich-si-rodice-oblibili-hlavne-osobnejsi-pristup-k-detem-vznikaji-i-v">nurseries with</a> a maximum of four children) have still not been resolved. The VAT reduction for home childcare services is then prepared, but the tax reduction for children&#39;s needs has not yet been adopted at all.</p>
