<p>Let us begin by stating that <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koalicni-smlouva-vlada-andreje-babise-hnuti-ano-cssd-jan-hamacek-zimola_1805150600_kno">the coalition agreement</a> signed between ANO and ČSSD contains the general principles of the coalition&#39;s functioning. The individual priorities and goals are then described in the government&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/jednani-vlady/programove-prohlaseni/programove-prohlaseni-vlady-165960/">program statement</a> , to which the coalition agreement refers. It states the government&#39;s commitment &quot; <em>We will increase the parental allowance to CZK 300,000.&quot;</em> It currently (per child) is <a href="https://portal.mpsv.cz/soc/ssp/obcane/rodicovsky_prisp">CZK 220,000</a> . From 2020, preparations are underway to increase the parental allowance to the aforementioned <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2916452-rodicovska-se-zrejme-vyrazne-zmeni-tak-jako-u-materske-davka-mohla-vychazet-z-vyse">CZK 300,000</a> .</p><p> There was <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit">agreement</a> across the political spectrum on increasing the parental allowance, however, there was disagreement on the key to increase the parental allowance and for whom. There were three options:</p><ol><li> Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Jana Maláčová (ČSSD) <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit">proposed</a> that the increased benefit apply to all parents whose children will be under 4 years old as of January 1, 2020. This option would mean an increase in budget costs of CZK 11.2 billion.</li><li> Minister of Finance Alena Schillerová (ANO) <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit">proposed</a> that the increased benefit apply to all parents who would be actively receiving parental allowance as of January 1, 2020. This option would be more economical by CZK 2.6 billion compared to option 1 and would mean an increase in budget costs by CZK 8.6 billion.</li><li> Another option and compromise <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2768231-komu-se-zvysi-rodicovska-vladni-navrh-se-vraci-na-stul-ministryne-financi">option</a> resulting from the coalition negotiations was the possibility of increasing the benefit for all parents whose child is born after January 1, 2020. This would represent a saving of approximately CZK 5.5 billion in the state budget compared to option 2 and an increase in budget costs of CZK 3 billion.</li></ol><p> In March, Minister Maláčová <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2764631-rust-rodicovske-a-duchodu-mohla-podporit-i-opozice-ne-ale-variantu-domluvenou-a">announced</a> that the coalition partners had agreed to implement a third option, which was subsequently denied by both Prime Minister Babiš and MP Maxová, saying that the agreement between the parties was different.</p><p> The individual coalition parties then stood by their proposals (ČSSD for the first option, ANO for the second option) and exchanged messages with each other through the media (e.g. <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2812658-zakon-o-rodicovske-predlozi-cssd-uz-za-tyden-nechceme-aby-se-navyseni-nestihlo">here</a> and <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819351-novy-rozpocet-bude-mit-schodek-40-miliard-sektorova-dan-nebude-banky-ale-maji">here</a> ). <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2769701-zive-o-kolik-se-zvednou-duchody-o-jejich-zvyseni-jednala-vlada"></a> , who and where has the savings to find the money for the announced increases, because the state budget deficit has already been announced at <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819351-novy-rozpocet-bude-mit-schodek-40-miliard-sektorova-dan-nebude-banky-ale-maji">CZK 40 billion</a> and it should not have been exceeded.</p><p> There was also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819144-rodicovska-na-programu-vlady-malacova-prichazi-s-kompromisem-potrebuje-osm-miliard">an option</a> to divide the increase in the allowance: in the first half of 2019 there would be an increase of CZK 40,000, and by the end of the election period there would then be a planned full increase of another CZK 40,000. However, MP Maxová supported the option of a one-time increase: &quot; <em>I personally would probably prefer the option that children whose parents receive parental allowance receive it, and spread the 80,000 according to the length of time they have been drawing parental allowance.&quot;</em> ( <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/pretahovani-o-rodicovskou-kdo-to-mysli-s-rodinami-lepe-malacova-nebo-babis-69733">Duel Seznam Zprávy</a> , time 1:40)</p><p> The bill was finally submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in <a href="https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/ALBSBCDM5SWO">a second version</a> (.doc, page 8) with a one-time increase of CZK 80,000 and passed <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=490">its second reading</a> in the Chamber of Deputies in September.</p><p> For the sake of completeness, let us add that MP Maxová was the chairwoman of the Social Policy Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic, but her <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2863985-zive-snemovna-resi-zvyseni-rodicovskeho-prispevku-i-oteviraci-dobu-obchodu">mandate as a member of parliament expired</a> in July because she became an MEP, and she therefore no longer participated <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=70821">in the vote</a> on the amendment to the law.</p>
