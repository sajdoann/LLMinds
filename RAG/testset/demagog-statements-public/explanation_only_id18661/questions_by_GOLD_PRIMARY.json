    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: Well, I recommended quite publicly when he was appointed (Minister of Culture Zaor√°lek, note: Demagog.cz) that he realize that he can have a comfortable life, going from reception to reception, from opening to opening, from festival to festival, but that the Ministry of Culture should take care of dilapidated cultural monuments.\nSECTION B: So I have problems with compulsory voting. I&#39;ll ignore the stupid argument that the communists introduced it. By the way, you know, right? On the contrary, they abolished Masaryk&#39;s law on compulsory voting and formally and only formally, voting was not compulsory. But something else is that under the communists, voting was enforced quite drastically, although not by law.\n\n\nSECTION C: When I recently told him (the director of the BIS Koudelka, note: Demagog.cz) that he should deal more with economic crime, the BIS spokesperson said that economic crime is not in the BIS job description, which means we have a stupid spokesperson here who doesn&#39;t even know the BIS Act, which includes the obligation to protect the economic interests of the Czech Republic. And tell me, what else but economic crime, including corruption and the fight against it, is the defense of economic interests.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
