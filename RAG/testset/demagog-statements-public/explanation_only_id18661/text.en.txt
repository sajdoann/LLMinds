<p>President Miloš Zeman <a href="https://www.barrandov.tv/video/167732-tyden-s-prezidentem-24-10-2019">stated</a> the following on TV Barrandov on October 24, 2019 (time 6:27): <em>&quot;Let Mr. Koudelka focus on economic crime in the Czech Republic instead of fictitiously chasing Russian and Chinese spies.&quot;</em></p><p> The President also responded to <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2955386-tajne-sluzby-rozbily-sit-kterou-v-cesku-vytvareli-rusove">the speech</a> of the Director of the Security Information Service, Michal Koudelka, in the Chamber of Deputies on October 21, 2019. He stated that the BIS and the National Center for Organized Crime (NCOZ) had last year uncovered and dismantled a spy network that was being built in the Czech Republic by the Russian intelligence service. The Russian Embassy denied this claim.</p><p> The BIS <a href="https://www.bis.cz/vyrocni-zpravy/vyrocni-zprava-bezpecnostni-informacni-sluzby-za-rok-2017-d85907e6.html">annual report</a> from 2017 also talks about Russian and Chinese influence. The report talks about two cyberattacks on <a href="https://www.bis.cz/public/site/bis.cz/content/vyrocni-zpravy/2017-vz-cz.pdf">the Foreign Ministry</a> (.pdf, pp. 15-16), about the &quot;infiltration&quot; of the Russian diplomatic mission by people with contacts in intelligence services (pp. 6-8), but also about disinformation websites (pp. 7-8).</p><p> A BIS spokesperson <a href="https://denikn.cz/minuta/221224/">defended himself</a> against Miloš Zeman&#39;s statement of October 24, 2019, saying: <em>&quot;The fight against corruption is not within the legal competence of the BIS. This issue is addressed by special units of the Czech Police.&quot;</em></p><p> The status and scope of the BIS are determined by Act <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153">No. 153/1994 Coll.</a> on the Intelligence Services of the Czech Republic. According to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153#p5-1-d">Section 5,</a> the BIS provides information on activities whose consequences may threaten the security or significant economic interests of the Czech Republic. According to the official website of the BIS, a significant economic interest <a href="https://www.bis.cz/ekonomicke-zajmy-statu/">is understood to be</a> an interest in the functionality of systems with a broad economic reach and in the optimal management of assets, the loss of which could threaten the basic functions of the state. <a href="http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1993ps/tisky/t101600.htm">The explanatory memorandum</a> to the Act on Intelligence Services speaks of the need to &quot; <em>detect through intelligence efforts also efforts directed against the mechanisms of the financial and economic functioning of the state in cases where their consequences may damage the interests of the Czech Republic&quot;.</em> These economic interests may be influenced, among other things, by illegal activities, which can include corruption, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the law or on the BIS website.</p><p> It cannot be ruled out that a specific case of corruption that would significantly threaten the economic interests of the Czech Republic could fall within the scope of the BIS. However, in general, the fight against economic crime is not within the scope of the BIS. This is investigated by specialized units of the Czech Police, <a href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/uokfk-skpv-utvar-odhalovani-korupce-a-financni-kriminality-skpv.aspx"></a> for example, the Corruption and Financial Crime Detection <a href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/uokfk-skpv-utvar-odhalovani-korupce-a-financni-kriminality-skpv.aspx">Unit</a> or the Organized Crime Detection <a href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/utvar-pro-odhalovani-organizovaneho-zlocinu-skpv-199737.aspx">Unit</a> of the SKPV.</p>
