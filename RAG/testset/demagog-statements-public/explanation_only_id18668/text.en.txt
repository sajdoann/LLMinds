<p>The ruling <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-za-novu-do-konce-dubna.A030318_144623_domaci_has">refers</a> to property disputes from 1999 to 2003 between TV Nova CEO Vladimír Železný (or CET 21, the broadcasting license <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/zelezny-prejmenuje-cet-21-na-tv-nova.A_990419_170757_domaci_jpl">holder</a> ) and American investors (CME). CME claims that its investments in TV Nova were <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/cesko-musi-cme-zaplatit-10-miliard-korun_200303151837_mtaborska">damaged</a> by Vladimír Železný&#39;s attempt to cut off foreign investors.</p><p> CEO Železný was <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-kvuli-nove-miliardy.A030314_200747_domaci_jpl">supported</a> in his attempt to spin off TV Nova from CME in 1999 by the Radio and Television Broadcasting Council, which is vaguely referred to in the ruling. These circumstances resulted in arbitration proceedings (or arbitral proceedings) that ended against the Czech Republic, which had <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/assets/cs/media/Dohoda_DPOI-USA-cesky.pdf">an obligation</a> (.pdf) to protect American foreign investments. The victorious company CME <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/rozhodnuto-cesko-za-arbitraz-zaplatilo.A030515_095759_domaci_has">received</a> over 10 billion crowns from the state in the arbitration dispute.</p>
