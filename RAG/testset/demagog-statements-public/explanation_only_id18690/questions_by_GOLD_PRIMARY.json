    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: TAKÁČ: The proposal says that the law on the obligation to provide information does not apply to ongoing criminal proceedings, with the exception of court decisions, so everyone will have access to the judgments. BARTOŠ: Well, but only at the very end of the whole case, so when there is a court proceeding, you would basically have a total embargo on all information until the decision.\nSECTION B: I was happy, for example, that I could support another year of the Romea scholarship awards for Roma students of secondary and higher vocational schools with Olga Richterová. It is a great project, but unfortunately there is a double excess of applicants who should receive the scholarship. It is not high, but the 14 thousand is a lot for their families.\nSECTION C: If we look at the records from the Chamber of Deputies, actually this whole one (the draft amendment to the Civil Service Act, note: Demagog.cz), why is it necessary to do it so conveniently for the government, Mr. Babiš and the Minister of Health argued that they have someone there who they can&#39;t seem to get rid of, which is simply not true.\nSECTION D: We are now also participating in the parliamentary anti-corruption group, where there are representatives of all parties, where the legislation is discussed so that there is a consensus. So the so-called &quot;Three Consensus&quot; version has now been negotiated, which will actually allow that if an investigation of the type &quot;I take the Rath case&quot; is underway, journalists would not even be able to write about the fact that this case is ongoing.\nSECTION E: EDITOR: ODS, TOP 09, STAN and the People&#39;s Party proposed rejecting measures that would burden people financially, whether it was doubling the land registry fee, taxing insurance company reserves, or maintaining a four percent tax on real estate transfers. You pushed through better conditions for home brewing and poker players. Isn&#39;t that a bit much? BARTOŠ: Their proposals didn&#39;t pass, ours did.\nSECTION F: It was the first thing that the government, still a minority government of Andrej Babiš without confidence, started to address, the civil service law. And unfortunately, the proposal that then seemed to fall out of their hands, was so opposed by the European Commission that the original idea of the law, which would cut off the influence of the executive branch and politicians, ministers on the operation of state administration, would lead to so-called depoliticization, and that is what is being disrupted by these measures. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
