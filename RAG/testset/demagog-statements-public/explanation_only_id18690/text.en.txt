The organization does not provide exact numbers of scholarship applicants, but <a href="https://romskastipendia.cz/index.php/aktuality/257-kdo-ziska-ze-studentu-ss-a-vos-stipendium-na-dalsi-skolni-rok-vysledky-budou-na-konci-letnich-prazdnin">it says</a> that last year there were approximately 150 applications. However, in the same article, scholarship program manager Jitka Votavová states that limited funds allow for scholarships to be provided to only about a third of applicants, which would mean 180 applications, given the 60 scholarships awarded last year.</p><p> The caption on the recording of this year&#39;s ceremony, which was provided by the internet television ROMEA TV, states that the scholarship recipients were selected from <em>&quot;more than 130 applicants&quot;</em> ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiqf2eL4H0c">video</a> , caption under the video, which is shown from 6:15 to 6:34). In his opening remarks, the moderator Lukáš Kotlár said that <em>&quot;the interest in Roma scholarships is really great, up to 150 students apply for these scholarships within the framework of the Romea program every year&quot;</em> ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiqf2eL4H0c">video</a> , 2:56). The exact number for this year is therefore probably between 130 and 150 applicants. This corresponds to approximately twice the number of scholarships awarded.</p><p> The amount of scholarships for secondary school students <a href="https://romskastipendia.cz/index.php/pro-studenty/pro-stredoskolaky-a-studenty-vos">is</a> 14,000 CZK per school year, while the organization offers a higher scholarship grant to VOŠ students, namely 21,000 CZK per school year.</p><p> We therefore assess the statement as true. We do not assess the amount of the scholarship as a value judgment, just as we do not assess its relative amount for the awarded families.</p>
