<p>On November 3, Mikuláš Ferjenčík started a new discussion thread on the Pirate Forum called <em>&quot;</em> <a href="https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407"><em>Establishment of a Party Ombudsman / Mediation Team</em></a> <em>&quot;.</em> The purpose of this thread is to determine whether to establish an institution within the Pirate Party that would aim to resolve internal party conflicts and create peace and consensus. At the same time, it should be an advisory institution where members could go if they felt that someone else in the party was treating them inappropriately. This thread also discusses the question of how <a href="https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407#p650292">to fill</a> this position and whether it should be <a href="https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407&amp;start=20#p650352">an internal</a> or external institution. This thread also discussed the question of whether it must be experts or whether listening to empathetic party members would be sufficient.</p><p> <a href="https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407&amp;start=30#p650657">Ivan Bartoš</a> divided his contribution to the forum into three parts. The first part concerns what the Pirates can resolve themselves, in the second part he focused on their own processes and their compliance, and in the third part he dealt with the mediation team, the ombudsman. In the third part of his contribution, he expressed himself in such a way that he would imagine an external institution and that it should be experts. He further stated: <em>&quot;For my part, I would like the Pirates to have resolved everything that is possible, including, for example, the selection of a partner to resolve these issues, by Christmas this year.&quot;</em></p><p> <a href="https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407">A poll question</a> was attached to this thread <em>: &quot;Do you consider the establishment of an ombudsman or mediation team a good idea?&quot;</em> The possible answers to this poll are Yes, No, and I don&#39;t know. 85 out of 100 voters voted in favor of establishing this institution, 6 voters were against, and 9 voters chose the I don&#39;t know option.</p><p> According to the Pirate Party&#39;s <a href="https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=248&amp;t=48927&amp;p=650901#p650901">budget</a> proposal for 2020, 300,000 crowns should be reserved for the creation of an ombudsman institution, a mediation team, or the hiring of a supervisor.<br/></p>
