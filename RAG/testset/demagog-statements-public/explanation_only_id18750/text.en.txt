<p>According to information from <a href="https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/vystavba-noveho-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan-by-mela-zacit-v-roce-2029--250598/">the Ministry of</a> Industry and Trade (MIT), a zoning decision on the construction of a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant should be issued in 2021, a supplier should be selected by the end of 2022, construction should begin in 2029, and the investment should be completed in 2036. There is a risk that in 2040, electricity supplies would not cover consumption for 678 or even up to 3,622 hours a year, and electricity consumption would therefore have to be regulated.</p><p> According to the news website <a href="https://ekolist.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/zpravy/cesi-jednali-poprve-v-bruselu-o-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan">Ekolist.cz,</a> a Czech delegation discussed the construction of a new nuclear unit in Dukovany in Brussels on November 20, 2019. It was the first major meeting that precedes the European Union&#39;s approval of the completion of the planned new unit at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant. We asked René Neděla, <a href="https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/ministerstvo/o-ministerstvu/vedouci-pracovnici/namestek-rene-nedela---strucny-portret--239909/">Deputy Minister</a> of Industry and Trade for Energy, who also <a href="https://ekonomickydenik.cz/cesi-jednali-bruselu-poprve-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan/">participated</a> in the meeting, whether the Commission had truly appreciated the Czech Republic&#39;s move towards a zero-emission economy.
