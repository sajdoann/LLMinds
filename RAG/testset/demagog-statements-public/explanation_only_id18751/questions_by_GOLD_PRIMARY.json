    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: ALSO, moderator: And the European Union, the European Commission appreciated it? You said. Does that mean some philosophical reservation like: no nuclear, that&#39;s out of the question, that wasn&#39;t made? HAVLÍČEK: In no case was it made at all. On the contrary, what was said was that it is right that we are heading towards a zero-emission economy, or rather energy, ad 1 and ad 2, it was clearly said that nuclear is a zero-emission source. The fact that someone has a tendency from time to time, especially from among the critics, to question that, that was said literally and literally by the Director General, (...) that&#39;s what the Director General of the Directorate General Energo, the European Commission, said directly.\nSECTION B: So we definitively announced that we are really going nuclear, we described what will be discussed, i.e. the fifth unit in Dukovany, and at the same time the so-called official negotiations have begun, which are not yet the exact itinerary of what, where, who will do exactly, but we had to start documenting why we are actually getting started. And the fundamental argument is clear, and I must say that the European Commission highly appreciated it - we are heading towards emission-free energy, that is, we will exchange coal, which today has a share of more than forty percent, for a higher position, i.e. the emergence of higher nuclear and renewable sources, and these are absolutely fundamental messages that to a certain extent actually correspond today with the priorities of the European Union or the European Commission.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
