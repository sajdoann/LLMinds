<p>Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlíček is talking about negotiations with the European Union regarding <a href="https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/vystavba-noveho-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan-by-mela-zacit-v-roce-2029--250598/">the completion of</a> a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany nuclear power plant. The Ministry of Industry and Trade has previously stated that the supplier should be selected by the end of 2022. The entire construction should therefore begin in 2029 at the latest, so that the new nuclear unit can be completed by 2036.</p><p> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said at the time that the construction was related to current events in Europe, both the fight against climate change and the reduction of emissions.</p><p> <em>&quot;If we look at what Europe looks like today, France is in first place, with 52 nuclear reactors, a nuclear share of 75 percent and a leader in the initiative to reduce CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Sweden has ten nuclear units and they also have hydropower resources. Unfortunately, we only have 30 percent at the moment and our goal is to have a nuclear share of 40 percent in 2040,&quot;</em> said Prime Minister Babiš <em>.</em> At the same time, <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/babis-cr-musi-stavet-jaderne-bloky-i-kdyby-porusila-pravo-eu/1809832">he has emphasized</a> in the past that the completion of the units must begin, even if it leads to a violation of European law.</p><p> Minister Havlíček further <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2976530-novy-jaderny-blok-v-dukovanech-ma-byt-dokoncen-v-roce-2036-uvedl-babis">stated</a> that the Czech Republic is negotiating the construction with the European Union with regard to the safety of the new facility and that it is also initiating the notification process with the European Commission, i.e. a certain authorization from the European Commission. As stated in the interview, these negotiations <a href="https://ekolist.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/zpravy/cesi-jednali-poprve-v-bruselu-o-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan">began</a> on November 20, 2019. In addition to the Czech energy mix, the Czech delegation also presented a vision for renewable sources in the Czech Republic, which should lead to a so-called <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2985236-cesko-miri-k-bezemisni-energetice-bude-predevsim-o-jadru-a-obnovitelnych-zdrojich">zero-emission economy</a> .</p><p> We asked about the course of these negotiations to <a href="https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/ministerstvo/o-ministerstvu/vedouci-pracovnici/namestek-rene-nedela---strucny-portret--239909/">the Deputy</a> for the Energy Section at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ing. et Ing. René Neděla, who also <a href="https://ekonomickydenik.cz/cesi-jednali-bruselu-poprve-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan/">attended</a> the negotiations. Since Deputy Neděla confirmed to us that the statements mentioned by Minister Havlíček actually occurred on the part of the Commission, we assess the statement as true.</p>
