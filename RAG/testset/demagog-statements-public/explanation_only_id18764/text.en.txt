<p>In his statement, Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlíček gives an illustrative example of the increasing costs of completing the Mochovce nuclear power plant in Slovakia.</p><p> Construction of the Slovak Mochovce nuclear power plant began in 1981. The two originally planned units with a total output of 880 MW were <a href="https://www.skoda-js.cz/reference/jaderna-elektrarna-mochovce-2/">completed</a> and commissioned in 1998 and 2000, respectively, while the construction of units 3 and 4, which Minister Havlíček is talking about, was <a href="http://www.seas.sk/data/file/87/sz-eia-mo34-sk.pdf">suspended</a> in 1992 (.pdf, pp. 1–3) and <a href="http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf">preserved</a> for a long time (.pdf, p. 11).<br/><br/> The actual construction work <a href="http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf">began</a> (.pdf, p. 12) in 2008 with a planned completion date of 2013 or 2014, but there have been several delays and the construction has become more expensive, for example due to <a href="https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/slovensky-urad-zjistil-nedostatky-v-budovane-jaderne-elektrarne-1362287">the introduction of</a> new safety features. According to the current plan, the power plant should be <a href="https://cz.seas.sk/jaderna-elektrarna-mochovce">completed</a> in 2020. However, developments <a href="https://oenergetice.cz/rychle-zpravy/dokonceni-slovenske-jaderne-elektrarny-mochovce-se-prodrazi-a-opet-opozdi/">indicate</a> that completion or start of operation on schedule may not happen again.</p><p> The construction of units 3 and 4 was stopped at a relatively advanced stage. At the time of the construction of the building, approximately 70% of the construction work had already <a href="http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf">been completed</a> (.pdf, p. 11) and approximately 30% of the equipment had been delivered. If Minister Havlíček is talking about this basis for the construction of the nuclear power plant worth 1 to 2 billion euros, then we have not been able to verify this amount. However, given the scope of the work carried out, it is likely that the amounts involved are in the order of billions of euros, as Havlíček correctly states.</p><p> If we now take a closer look at the financing of the completion of the Mochovce power plant, the latest reported cost increase <a href="https://oenergetice.cz/rychle-zpravy/dokonceni-slovenske-jaderne-elektrarny-mochovce-se-prodrazi-a-opet-opozdi/">is</a> 5.67 billion euros, which is 144.6 billion crowns at <a href="https://www.kurzy.cz/kurzy-men/nejlepsi-kurzy/EUR-euro/">the exchange rate</a> of 25 November 2019. For example, in 2014, the estimated costs <a href="https://www.seas.sk/clanok/akcionari-schvalili-rozpocet-na-dokoncenie-mochoviec/138">were</a> 4.6 billion euros, which would be 117.3 billion crowns at today&#39;s exchange rate. If the price of the power plant was set at 7 billion euros, the price of the power plant would be 178.5 billion crowns at today&#39;s exchange rate. Similar prices are not <a href="https://oenergetice.cz/jaderne-elektrarny/jake-jsou-ceny-za-jaderne-reaktory-iii-generace/">unusual</a> .</p><p> Let us add that <a href="https://www.seas.sk/mochovce-3-4-npp">the output</a> of the parts of the nuclear power plant being built should be 2 x 471 MWe, a total close to the 1000 MW stated by Havlíček.</p><p></p>
