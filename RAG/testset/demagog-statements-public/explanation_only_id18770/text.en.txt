<p><a href="https://www.nukib.cz/cs/o-nukib/">NÚKIB</a> is the central administrative authority for cybersecurity, including the protection of classified information in the field of information and communication systems and cryptographic protection. The abbreviation NÚKIB stands for National Office for Cyber and Information Security.</p><p> On December 17, 2018, the agency issued <a href="https://www.nukib.cz/cs/uredni-deska/">a warning</a> against the use of software and hardware from Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. The agency&#39;s <a href="https://www.nukib.cz/download/uredni-deska/Varov%C3%A1n%C3%AD%20N%C3%9AKIB%202018-122-17.pdf">report</a> (.pdf, p. 1) states, among other things, that &quot; <em>the use of technical or program resources from the above-mentioned companies poses a threat to cybersecurity</em> .&quot; The agency justifies its position, among other things, by saying that Chinese laws and the political environment &quot; <em>require private companies to cooperate in pursuing the interests of the PRC, including participation in intelligence activities&quot;</em> (p. 1).<br/><br/> State agencies and private companies that manage critical information infrastructure or important information systems <a href="https://www.itbiz.cz/zpravicky/huawei-vyvoj-kauzy">are required</a> by law to conduct a security audit based on a warning from the National Cybersecurity Office. The institutions <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/huawei-kauza-vyrobky-cinska-firma-varovani-nukib-analyza-audit-riziko_1901250600_kno">are not required</a> to publish their analysis or submit it to the government. By law, only the Cybersecurity Office can review the audits.</p><p> Analyses of critical systems falling under the Cybersecurity Act were already <a href="https://www.nukib.cz/cs/informacni-servis/aktuality/1349-ministerstva-urady-i-firmy-provedly-predepsane-analyzy-prijimaji-opatreni-ke-snizeni-rizika/">completed</a> in the first half of this year. Other systems have also undergone analysis; for example, the Ministry of the Interior planned <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/varovani-nukib-huawei-bezpecnostni-hrozba-ministerstva_1903260600_tec">to complete</a> the analyses of all systems only by the end of the third quarter of 2019. However, this was due to the large number of systems that the ministry manages. On the contrary, the Ministries of Health and Labor and Social Affairs, for example, completed audits of all their systems in the spring of 2019.</p><p> We therefore assess the statement as false, because even though we cannot rule out that some audit is actually underway, most of them, especially audits of critical infrastructure, have already been completed.</p>
