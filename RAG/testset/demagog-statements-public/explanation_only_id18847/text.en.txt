<p>President Miloš Zeman, at a meeting with foreign ambassadors on October 27, 2019, did indeed begin <a href="https://www.hrad.cz/cs/prezident-cr/soucasny-prezident-cr/vybrane-projevy-a-rozhovory/projev-prezidenta-republiky-pri-setkani-se-cleny-diplomatickeho-sboru-15112">his speech</a> with almost identical words: <em>&quot;Distinguished ambassadors, dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends of the Czech Republic, welcome to a successful country! Welcome to a country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, stable economic growth, and very low national debt.&quot;</em> He did not mention the declining national debt at the time.</p><p> We consider the opening words to be true in terms of content as well. The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is indeed the lowest in the European Union. According to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics">Eurostat data from October 2019</a> , it is 2.2%, while the average unemployment rate in the EU-28 is 6.3%.</p><p> If we measure economic growth by GDP, then the Czech Republic is truly in a period of growth. According to <a href="https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/92010940/chmu100119.xlsx/d8a25f9f-e671-4fd1-a1f7-0b090610fbbd?version=1.0">Czech Statistical Office data</a> (.xlsx), GDP has been growing by at least 2.5% year-on-year since 2013.</p><p> President Miloš Zeman says that the state debt is relatively decreasing and low. It is true that in relative terms of state debt to GDP, the debt is indeed decreasing. As can be seen <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en">in Eurostat data</a> , this trend has been evident since 2013, when the debt was at 44.9%. In 2018, the share of state debt to GDP was 32.6%. However, in absolute numbers, state debt is not clearly decreasing, on the contrary, it is rather fluctuating, which can be traced <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/rizeni-statniho-dluhu/dluhova-statistika/struktura-a-vyvoj-statniho-dluhu">in the data of the Ministry of Finance</a> . According to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en">Eurostat data,</a> the debt of the Czech Republic is one of the lowest in the EU. The average share of state debt to GDP in the EU is 80.4%. Estonia and Bulgaria, for example, have lower relative state debt than the Czech Republic.</p><p> The average wage growth is reported <a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/prace_a_mzdy_prace">by the Czech Statistical Office</a> . In the 3rd quarter of 2019, the average wage reached CZK 33,697 (increased by 6.9% year-on-year).</p><p> The growth of old-age pensions can be monitored, for example, <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/statni-rozpocet/hospodareni-systemu-duchodoveho-pojisten">on data from the Ministry of Finance</a> . In 2016, the average old-age pension was CZK 11,460, in 2017 it was CZK 11,850, and in 2018 the average old-age pension reached CZK 12,418.</p>
