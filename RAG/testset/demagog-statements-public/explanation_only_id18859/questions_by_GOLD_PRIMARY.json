    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: And then there is Libya. That is the biggest problem. There is not actually one government there, there are elections coming up, the Libyan guard, which we helped as part of Operation Sofia, is very effective. It is holding the ships, 84% and they didn&#39;t have oil in August. So Prime Minister Conte was dealing with oil, because it is a state-owned company, but the government was not able to force them to give the Libyan guard oil so that they could hold the ships.\nSECTION B: He (Miloš Zeman, note: Demagog.cz) was known to Mr. Sobotka, who first went to the president with the nomination of Mr. Prouza to head the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and when he told Sobotka that he would never appoint Prouza, he came up with another name and did not even propose Prouza. It was the same with my dismissal, which he did not push through, so I resigned myself.\nSECTION C: ...and I discussed it with him (Wolfgang Schäuble - note: Demagogue) and he always understood us, he saw it at the press conference and said yes, here is the Czech Republic, and the V4 have a different history, they don&#39;t have the multicultural model and we don&#39;t want it, because the foreigners haven&#39;t been integrated in the individual states. \nSECTION D: Why, at a time when no foreign power threatens us or interferes in our affairs, and we, as a state and as citizens, truly have our destiny in our own hands for the first time in centuries, do we have so few reasons for joyful satisfaction? These words were uttered exactly 28 years ago, in 1992, in the New Year&#39;s speech of the then President Václav Havel.\nSECTION E: On April 24, a petition demanding Stanek&#39;s dismissal was created, and on April 28, the vice-chairman of the ČSSD Onderka began demanding the dismissal of his own minister, contrary to the position of his own chairman. On May 2, I received the petition signatories at the Government Office, and Mr. Hamáček, who stood up for Stanek, was also at the meeting with them.\n\nSECTION F: Look at how we are increasing pensions. Here we are, the coalition government, we haven&#39;t had time yet. And here we are, 2018, 475 crowns and this is the proposal of the minority government of the ANO movement. That, my government, which ruled brilliantly for 205 days, without confidence, but it worked perfectly, is increasing 918 crowns on average per month and another 1,000 crowns for pensioners aged 85. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
