The speech began with the following <a href="http://www.darius.cz/ag_nikola/cl_havel_4.html">words</a> : <em>&quot;Dear fellow citizens, I have been asking myself this fundamental question for some time now: why, at a time when no foreign power threatens us or interferes in our affairs, and we</em> - <em>as a state and as citizens</em> - <em>truly have our destiny in our own hands for the first time in centuries, do we have so few reasons for joyful satisfaction?&quot;</em><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
