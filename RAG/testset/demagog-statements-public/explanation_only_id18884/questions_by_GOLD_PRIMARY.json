    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: What we disagree on is that the Ministry of the Interior actually calculated it as if we were building all the offices on a green field, as if there were no construction procedures here. So of course it calculated the new offices for civil servants at 30 billion crowns. Nothing like that will happen and I am sorry that the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior does not state that the state currently pays municipalities for the civil servants who handle construction procedures, for the rental of those rooms, for overheads, and so on. It is not a small amount. The state pays municipalities 4 billion a year. And of that, 360 million is roughly for overheads and rent.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
