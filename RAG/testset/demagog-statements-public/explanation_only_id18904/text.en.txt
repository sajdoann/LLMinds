<p>Jindřich Šídlo actually <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/batolata-s-plamenometem-se-chystaji-prevzit-moc-pomohli-jsme-piratum-vybrat-cleny-jejich-budouci-vlady-79756">used</a> the phrase &quot;toddlers with flamethrowers&quot; in his show Happy Monday on September 30, 2019. Specifically, at 5 minutes and 32 seconds. The entire sentence reads: &quot; <em>These are the Pirates, or as we, traditional voters, toddlers with flamethrowers, who may soon rule us.&quot;</em> He used this sentence after describing the internal party vote on performers at a pre-election rally before the 2019 EP elections. The vote was on whether the leader of the candidate, Marcel Kolaja, or a pony, would speak at the rally. The pony <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/pirati-ponici-hlasovani-kolaja-olomouc-anketa-evropsky-parlament.A190523_093758_zahranicni_elz">won</a> .</p><p> The phrase was not <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/spratci-s-plamenometem-chteji-zmeknout-a-vzit-babisovi-volice-neztrati-ty-vlastni-86178?seq-no=86&amp;dop-ab-variant=&amp;source=clanky-home">repeated</a> literally by the reporter of the Seznam Zprávy server, Václav Dolejší, specifically saying &quot;with <em>workers with flamethrowers&quot;.</em> In his article, he describes his view of the national pirate forum, which took place between January 11 and 12, 2020. He also describes, from his perspective, the coming of age of the party, the Pirate Party&#39;s plans for the next elections, and also the vote to dissolve the party, which is allegedly <a href="https://www.televizeseznam.cz/video/stastne-pondeli/o-rozpusteni-strany-budeme-hlasovat-kazdy-rok-varuji-pirati-64020001">an exaggeration</a> (time 1:31) and takes place every year.</p><p> The words &quot;toddlers&quot; and &quot;toddlers&quot; are different, but they share a common context.</p><p> However, the phrase &quot;toddlers with flamethrowers&quot; has been used several times in history. Specifically, in the program <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/10117034229-168-hodin/219452801101027">168 hodin</a> (time 8:00) broadcast on October 27, 2019, Václav Dolejší stated that he had read the term on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=batolata%20s%20plamenometem&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">Twitter</a> . Before the broadcast, the term was mentioned on Twitter three times. On September 30, 2019, which could have been related to Jindřich Šídl&#39;s program. However, the absolute first traced mention of this term dates back to September 29, 2017, when Petr Honzejk mentioned it in <a href="https://nazory.ihned.cz/c1-65896710-volebni-denik-petra-honzejka-pirati-jedou-copak-nam-vezou-z-napadu-na-vladu-vseholidu-jdou-na-liberala-mrakoty">Hospodářské noviny</a> , saying that he found it on Josef Bouška&#39;s Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bouska.j?fref=search&amp;__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARATv4gnMklW-3fhW7T_6Ng1rzvfL_T7Di8q8pbhcxbV2_78eUX0x_OdUuVJu0E_WLYxWR1PRrg8_GWG">profile</a> . We went through the posts, but we did not find the mention. However, the post may have been deleted.</p><p> Although the term &quot;toddlers with flamethrowers&quot; appeared before Jindřich Šídlo used it, he undoubtedly contributed significantly to its popularization, and we therefore assess the statement as true.</p>
