    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: EDITOR: ODS, TOP 09, STAN and the People&#39;s Party proposed rejecting measures that would burden people financially, whether it was doubling the land registry fee, taxing insurance company reserves, or maintaining a four percent tax on real estate transfers. You pushed through better conditions for home brewing and poker players. Isn&#39;t that a bit much? BARTOŠ: Their proposals didn&#39;t pass, ours did.\nSECTION B: I talked about the need to hire a dedicated person to set up communication processes and identify burnout among some politicians. I proposed a budget amendment so that we could pay for such an expert. I promised on our online forum that I would come up with some concrete proposal by Christmas. \nSECTION C: Even in the 2017 pre-election strategy, and in the next one, it is clearly defined. We said that we will not go with undemocratic parties or support a government that will use their votes. So at the moment it is SPD or KSČM. And then we set clear conditions and those conditions of cooperation were there. It will not be a government that will have a majority of YES. There will be no people who have a corrupt past or are in a conflict of interest.\nSECTION D: It was the first thing that the government, still a minority government of Andrej Babiš without confidence, started to address, the civil service law. And unfortunately, the proposal that then seemed to fall out of their hands, was so opposed by the European Commission that the original idea of the law, which would cut off the influence of the executive branch and politicians, ministers on the operation of state administration, would lead to so-called depoliticization, and that is what is being disrupted by these measures. \nSECTION E: Editor: And Mr. Chairman, do you think that you are already an adult party and that what commentators often say about you, that you are toddlers with a flamethrower, because you burn everything out of the opposition, but you are unable to come to an agreement with anyone, no longer applies to you? Bartoš: That was a famous statement by Mr. Jindřich Šídl, I saw it when someone repeated it in your editorial office in a comment on the forum.\nSECTION F: I was happy, for example, that I could support another year of the Romea scholarship awards for Roma students of secondary and higher vocational schools with Olga Richterová. It is a great project, but unfortunately there is a double excess of applicants who should receive the scholarship. It is not high, but the 14 thousand is a lot for their families.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
