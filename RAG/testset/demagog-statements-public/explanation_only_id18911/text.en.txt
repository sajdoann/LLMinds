<p>By the term &quot;pre-election&quot;, Pirates Chairman Bartoš probably means <a href="https://www.pirati.cz/program/psp2017/povolebni-strategie/">the 2017 post-election strategy</a> , which the Pirates published before the 2017 elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the introduction of which states:</p><p> <em>&quot;We will negotiate with all other political parties. Our support for any government is conditional on the fact that incompetent people or people with a history of corruption are not nominated to the government. In no case will we support a government with the participation of entities threatening the foundations of liberal democracy or with a historical legacy of the liquidation of democracy in this country, i.e. in particular with the participation of the KSČM, SPD or a predominance of ANO.&quot;</em> The post-election strategy further states: <em>&quot;We will demand reasonable guarantees to prevent abuse of power, for example, we will refuse to support candidates who would be in a constant conflict of interest.&quot;</em></p><p> The Pirates therefore really condition their support for the government on the democracy of their potential coalition partners. According to the cited post-election strategy, the Pirates reject cooperation with the SPD and the KSČM. Ivan Bartoš further states the refusal to support a government in which the ANO movement will have a majority, which is also in line with the cited part of the strategy. According to the cited post-election strategy, Bartoš also states a corrupt past and a conflict of interest as an obstacle to possible support for the government.</p><p> There is also a pirate <a href="https://wiki.pirati.cz/program/eu2019/strategie">post-election strategy for the 2019</a> European Parliament elections, which is in line with the previously cited document. It states:</p><p> &quot; <em>We want our program priorities and personnel requirements for the Commissioners to be reflected in the negotiations. European Commissioners must be competent people, without corruption scandals and ties to lobbyists of large corporations. (...) We therefore refuse to participate in the formation of a political group with undemocratic parties or parties that do not respect human rights or are fundamentally against the existence of the European Union as such.&quot;</em></p>
