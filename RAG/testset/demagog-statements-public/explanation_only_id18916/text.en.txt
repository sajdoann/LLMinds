<p>Lukáš Wagenknecht <a href="http://www.nfpk.cz/oznamovatele/4198">is</a> truly an expert in the fight against corruption. For his work, for example, in 2015 he received the Courage Award from the Anti-Corruption Foundation.</p><p> Wagenknecht was the first deputy at the Ministry of Finance from February<a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/volby/lukas-wagenknecht-andrej-babis-obse-agrofert_1904171355_haf">2014</a> , when Andrej Babiš was the Minister of Finance. He dismissed him after a year and a quarter, although he also offered him the position of political deputy, which Wagenknecht did not accept.</p><p> In his statement, Ivan Bartoš is apparently referring to <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/babis-odvolal-prvni-namestka-wagenknechta.A150620_070857_domaci_zt">the conflict</a> between Lukáš Wagenknecht and Andrej Babiš regarding the non-transparent tender procedure for the IT system prepared by the Ministry of Regional Development. This case ultimately <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1608335-brusel-dal-cesku-stopku-na-dotace-na-projekty-za-568-milionu-korun">led</a> to the suspension of the disbursement of subsidies in the amount of 568 million crowns. However, we will not assess the real reasons for Wagenknecht&#39;s dismissal, because we understandably do not know the real motivation of Prime Minister Babiš.<br/><br/> In 2018, Lukáš Wagenknecht was actually <a href="https://volby.cz/pls/senat/se1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=9&amp;xt=1">elected</a> senator for the Pirates.</p>
