    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: EDITOR: But you had a campaign based on a bus, in which you had pictures of various politicians. IVAN BARTOŠ: There was a funny bus, so everyone was in civilian clothes, there were caricatures and people from the Social Democrats were sitting there. People who were in the government for the KDU-ČSL and then for TOP 09, for example, were sitting there.\nSECTION B: So I&#39;ll just briefly talk about Lukáš Wagenknecht. Andrej Babiš brought him to finance as a top analyst who fights corruption. And Lukáš Wagenknecht started doing his job, and of course Mr. Babiš didn&#39;t like that, so he fired him, he rejected him. Lukáš Wagenknecht was elected for the Pirates in the last election period in the last Senate elections,\nSECTION C: I talked about the need to hire a dedicated person to set up communication processes and identify burnout among some politicians. I proposed a budget amendment so that we could pay for such an expert. I promised on our online forum that I would come up with some concrete proposal by Christmas. \nSECTION D: Even in the 2017 pre-election strategy, and in the next one, it is clearly defined. We said that we will not go with undemocratic parties or support a government that will use their votes. So at the moment it is SPD or KSČM. And then we set clear conditions and those conditions of cooperation were there. It will not be a government that will have a majority of YES. There will be no people who have a corrupt past or are in a conflict of interest.\nSECTION E: Editor: And Mr. Chairman, do you think that you are already an adult party and that what commentators often say about you, that you are toddlers with a flamethrower, because you burn everything out of the opposition, but you are unable to come to an agreement with anyone, no longer applies to you? Bartoš: That was a famous statement by Mr. Jindřich Šídl, I saw it when someone repeated it in your editorial office in a comment on the forum.\nSECTION F: He is on the election committee (Lukáš Wagenknecht, note: Demagog.cz), which elected him himself. There are a lot of people on the election committee. People from the media department, our politicians, regional campaign coordinators, and Lukáš Wagenknecht was elected there as the head who deals with the preparation of the campaign, its financing and coordination.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
