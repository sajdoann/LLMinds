<p>Jakub Michálek <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/pirati-jakub-michalek-hlasovani-tajna-volba_1911042232_cha">faced</a> an unsuccessful attempt to dismiss him from the position of First Vice-Chairman of the Pirates at the turn of October and November 2019. In November 2019, he announced that <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/pirati-jakub-michalek-hlasovani-tajna-volba_1911042232_cha">he would not</a> defend his position as Vice-Chairman and would continue to work in the Chamber of Deputies. He has been <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/detail.sqw?id=6477">the chairman of</a> the Pirates parliamentary group since October 2017. <a href="https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=477&amp;t=49233&amp;fbclid=IwAR3CjlxLyM3wButbNNkQJZXW5XgKCeq4WkJXgZrKibvgYQTMkXuSl3cGYSk#p645886)%20">He commented</a> on his dismissal on the Pirates forum in a post dated October 24, 2019, as follows:</p><p> <em>&quot;I said some time ago that I would not run again, that I want to fully concentrate on leading the club and leave the work in the republican presidency to someone else who has fresh enthusiasm to move things forward. We have a lot of new, talented representatives and I want to take a break, finish my dissertation and devote more time to my loved ones.&quot;</em></p><p> MP Michálek then actually on January 7, 2020 <a href="https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/michalek-zustava-predsedou-poslaneckeho-klubu.html"></a> <a href="https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/michalek-zustava-predsedou-poslaneckeho-klubu.html">defended</a> the post of chairman of the Pirates parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, as Michálek&#39;s post on the pirate forum confirms the words of MP Bartoš that Michálek had proclaimed his intention not to defend the post of party vice-chairman even before the case of his dismissal. However, we were unable to find out from public sources whether this was actually the case in the summer of 2019.</p>
