<p>The Minister of Industry and Trade, Karel Havlíček, has indeed announced to the media his intentions to postpone the frequency auction in which the fourth operator is to be selected. The first mentions appeared in <a href="https://www.respekt.cz/spolecnost/ministr-premysli-ze-odlozi-aukci-na-ctvrteho-operatora">October</a> 2019. At that time, the start of the auction was <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/ctu-presunul-zahajeni-aukce-mobilnich-kmitoctu-na-leden/1810374">postponed</a> to the beginning of January 2020. According to the media, the reason was Vodafone&#39;s complaint to the European Commission about network sharing by CETIN and T-Mobile, or rather the Commission&#39;s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/ip_19_5110">communication</a> , which implies a possible restriction of competition.</p><p> Talk of a further shift began again in <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/internet-a-pc/mobil/clanek/ctvrty-operator-v-cesku-ministerstvo-zvazuje-posunuti-aukce-5g-siti-40306971">December</a> 2019. Minister Havlíček argued that the current auction conditions would not attract a sufficient number of bidders.</p><p> A fundamental change was brought about by the resignation, or rather the dismissal, of the head of the Czech Telecommunications Office, Jaromír Novák. He submitted his resignation on January 31, 2020. The government <a href="https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABLBBAHHQ">managed</a> to dismiss him that day. Jaromír Novák <a href="https://twitter.com/xmireknovak/status/1221716597624184833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1221716597624184833&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lupa.cz%2Fclanky%2Fpredseda-rady-ctu-jaromir-novak-rezignoval-kvuli-tlaku-ministra-na-aukci-5g-kmitoctu%2F">justified</a> his resignation by saying that he was dissatisfied with the development of the auction conditions.</p><p> As for the argument about security risks, we were unable to find any statements or reports in connection with the Ministry of Industry and Trade mentioning a potential security risk. The only mentions of the security issue were made after Jaromír Novák was dismissed. In an article for <a href="https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/proc-verim-ve-ctvrteho-operatora/">the Lupa.cz</a> server, Novák stated that he had asked the Prime Minister to check the economic ties between potential participants in the auction and the resulting security risks. He said that he had not encountered any problems that would lead to the exclusion of any participant from the auction. In an interview for <a href="https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66713970-zlevneni-prinese-jen-silny-ctvrty-operator-inspirace-slovenskem-nicemu-nepomuze-rika-odvolany-sef-ctu-novak">Hospodářské noviny</a> , he also stated that he had not received any information from the security services last autumn.</p><p> We cannot therefore decide whether the Ministry of Industry and Trade or Minister Havlíček personally warned anyone about the security risks of potentially setting the auction in favor of one participant. However, no one from the Ministry of Industry and Trade spoke publicly about such a risk.</p>
