<p>Minister Havlíček <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/internet-a-pc/mobil/clanek/ctvrty-operator-v-cesku-ministerstvo-zvazuje-posunuti-aukce-5g-siti-40306971">opposed</a> the proposed terms of the frequency auction prepared by the Czech Telecommunications Office. He defended his words by saying that the proposed method would not attract a sufficient number of interested parties.</p><p> The situation escalated at the end of January 2020. On January 27, the then Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Office, Jaromír Novák, submitted his resignation effective January 1. The Ministry of Industry and Trade managed <a href="https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABLBBAHHQ">to dismiss</a> Novák on January 27. Jaromír Novák justified his resignation by saying that the new proposed auction conditions would not lead to an improvement in the competitive environment, would jeopardize the rapid deployment of 5G networks, and would lead to a number of lawsuits.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="cs" dir="ltr"> I summarized the reasons for my resignation in a letter. <a href="https://t.co/dSK8o623vq">pic.twitter.com/dSK8o623vq</a></p> — Jaromir Novak (@xmireknovak) <a href="https://twitter.com/xmireknovak/status/1221716597624184833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2020</a> </blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p> Jaromír Novák also said that the final moment when he decided to resign came when the government was allegedly discussing a new auction proposal, but he <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/internet-a-pc/mobil/clanek/odvolany-predseda-rady-ctu-jaromir-novak-prichod-ctvrteho-operatora-je-ohrozen-40311903">was not</a> invited to the meeting.</p><p> Before his resignation, Jaromír Novák positively <a href="https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/kmitocty-jaromira-novaka-od-aukce-pres-velkoobchodni-nabidky-az-k-zakonu/">assessed</a> the prepared conditions of the auction: <em>&quot;We prepared the auction with the utmost responsibility and care, and we believe it has the potential to meet the goals that the government was informed about last year, namely in particular strengthening competition through the entry of a nationwide fourth infrastructure operator and starting the development of 5G networks. We can also see this in the market responses, where there is a real interest from new players in participating in the auction, as well as the concerns of existing operators about new competition that would stimulate competition in the household segment and ensure better conditions for customers nationwide.&quot;</em> Even after leaving office, the former chairman <a href="https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/predseda-rady-ctu-jaromir-novak-rezignoval-kvuli-tlaku-ministra-na-aukci-5g-kmitoctu/">defended</a> the course of preparation and the result itself in the form of the auction rules.</p><p> As for the CTU <a href="https://www.ctu.cz/rada-ctu">Council</a> , we found only one mention of the original CTU proposal. And that was by the current chairwoman Hana Tóvárková, who was <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/operator-mobilni-operatori-v-cr-cesko-hana-tovarkova-ctu-cesky-telekomunikacni_2001291830_ako">appointed</a> to replace Jaromír Novák. On November 12, 2019, the then member of the CTU Council Tóvárková <a href="https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/aukce-5g-kmitoctu-je-do-velke-miry-politicka-zalezitost-rika-nova-radni-ctu-hana-tovarkova/">said</a> that the proposal could be subject to changes, but she also supported the then chairwoman Novák in saying that the auction must take place as quickly as possible.</p><p> We did not find any public statements from other members of the CTU Council, specifically Jiří Peterka, Josef Chomyn and Lukáš Zelený, regarding the auction or the upcoming changes. However, we do not know whether they opposed the conditions prepared by the CTU in closed negotiations with the Ministry of Industry and Trade or elsewhere. Therefore, we assess the statement as unverifiable.</p>
