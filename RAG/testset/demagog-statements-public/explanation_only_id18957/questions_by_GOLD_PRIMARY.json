    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: It is necessary to respect the opinion of the European Commission, which made a fundamental comment, namely the so-called network sharing. It stated that as it is in the Czech Republic, it is definitely not in the regime of a normal competitive environment, literally and literally stating that it eliminates further investments in innovation and thus eliminates consumer comfort. \n\nSECTION B: And what is also extremely important, what was said by the European Commission, is that the energy mix is somehow the exclusive competence of individual European Union countries. We will not interfere with how you model it, on the other hand, you must meet certain legislative criteria also vis-à-vis the European Commission in terms of, for example, illegal support and the like. And if you meet all of this, we are ready to notify the process. \nSECTION C: If you look, in Slovakia it cost, I mean Mochovce, three, four, which is approximately 1000 MW of power, it cost 6 billion euros. Yes, someone still claims, but you already had a base there in the order of one to two billion, so let&#39;s admit that it was 7 billion. That means, then it&#39;s around the amount of 100, 150, 160, 180 billion. It depends on the exchange rate used to convert it.\nSECTION D: The Czech Telecommunications Office also acknowledged this (doubts about the auction for the operator&#39;s entry, note: Demagog.cz). There were people from the CTU Council, such as Chairman Novák, who said, it&#39;s absolutely perfect, I support it; and there were other members of the Council who said, I absolutely disagree with it; and they leaned towards the solution suggested by the Ministry of Industry and Trade or other operators. \n\nSECTION E: HAVLÍČEK: (...) and then we have NÚKIB, an independent institution. TAKÁČ, moderator: Who stated what he stated that it is a security risk (Huawei, note: Demagog.cz). HAVLÍČEK: Yes, he stated it at the end of last year. At the moment, if I have the correct information, an audit of all devices is actually underway at the state level.\nSECTION F: We have been warning for several months and we also had security information that this (the operator entry auction, note: Demagog.cz) can only benefit one interested party, that there will be no foreign entity and that therefore what was expected from it will not happen, and that this is a really good competitive environment that will lead to a reduction in the prices of data services and the preparation of the environment for 5G.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
