<p>The European Commission&#39;s preliminary conclusions on the network sharing agreement in the Czech Republic between O2 CZ/CETIN and T-Mobile CZ can be found in the European Commission&#39;s press <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/ip_19_5110">release</a> from August 2019.</p><p> The report states that network sharing is &quot; <em>a common practice that can reduce costs and facilitate the development of electronic communications networks. In most cases it leads to greater efficiency. However, in certain circumstances it can have negative effects on competition</em> .&quot;</p><p> According to the same source, Commissioner Margrethe Vestager commented on the situation in the Czech Republic as follows:</p><p> <em>“Network sharing by operators is generally beneficial to consumers, as it leads to faster network development, cost savings and coverage of rural areas. However, if there are indications that cooperation agreements may harm consumers, it is our duty to investigate them and ensure that there is real competition in the market. In this case, we are concerned that a network sharing agreement between the two largest operators in the Czech Republic is restricting competition in more densely populated parts of the country.”</em></p><p> The Commission identified two aspects as specific variables occurring on the Czech market:</p><ul><li> high concentration of the Czech market with only three mobile operators</li><li> The operators O2 and T-Mobile, which are affected by the sharing, control three quarters of the market</li></ul><p> The press release concludes with the following:</p><p> <em>&quot;The Commission therefore preliminarily concludes that the network sharing agreement between the two main Czech mobile operators</em> <em><strong>restricts competition, thereby hindering innovation</strong></em> <em>, and thus infringes EU antitrust rules. The Commission is of the opinion that in this specific case the agreement does not lead to greater efficiency and quality of services, but rather likely to lead to a lack</em> <strong><em>of incentives for the operators concerned to improve their networks and services for the benefit of users</em></strong> .&quot;</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because in his statement the Minister fulfilled the essence of the wording of the European Commission&#39;s press release. It is necessary to note that the Minister is not entirely precise (the use of the word &quot;eliminate&quot;). However, <a href="http://synonymus.cz/doslova/">we will not</a> take the final part of the Minister&#39;s statement as an attempt at an exact quotation, because the expression &quot;literally and literally&quot; can have different meanings (for example, &quot;word by word&quot;, but also &quot;really&quot;).</p>
