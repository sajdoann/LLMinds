<p>We interpret the term “our period” as the period when the ANO movement ruled in a minority cabinet after the elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the autumn of 2017. Taking into account a certain amount of time to form a government, we examined the changes in the Value Added Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Act”) from 1 January 2018. Since this period, VAT has been reduced under three amendments. These were Amendment No. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501">256/2019</a> Coll., Amendment No. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=">80/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6">6/2019</a> Coll.</p><p> Amendment No. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501">256/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=">80/2019</a> Coll. were government bills that introduced a reduction in VAT on a wide range of goods and services. What did not escape great media attention was the reduction in the rate on beer.</p><p> List of goods and services for which the VAT rate was reduced by Amendment No. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501">256/2019</a> Coll.:</p><ol><li> <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501?text=%C2%A7%2047">Electronic books</a></li><li> Catering services, serving drinks (VAT on beer is reduced under this item)</li><li> Interior cleaning services performed in households</li><li> Home care for children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled</li><li> Shoe and leather goods repair</li><li> Repairs and alterations of clothing and textile products</li><li> Bicycle repairs</li><li> Hairdressing and barber services</li></ol><p> As part of Amendment No. <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=68877">80/2019</a> Coll. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=104.">, &quot;heat and cold</a> &quot; was moved from the first reduced rate (15%) to the second reduced rate (10%).</p><p> Since these were government amendments to the law, it is understandable that they were <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=70948">supported</a> by the ANO movement. Deputies from the ČSSD and the KSČM, which supports the government, also <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=69368&amp;l=cz">voted</a> for the proposals. In fact, not a single deputy was against the amendment No. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=">80/2019</a> .</p><p> The amendment to the VAT Act No. <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6">6/2019</a> Coll. was adopted in the Chamber of Deputies as <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=140">a parliamentary proposal</a> by deputies from the STAN movement. It also contains a reduced rate for regular land public passenger transport, which Andrej Babiš talks about in his statement. In the Chamber of Deputies, this amendment <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=68622&amp;l=cz">was not supported</a> by the ANO movement and deputies from the ČSSD, the vast majority of whom abstained from voting.</p><p> Regular ground public passenger transport has therefore <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6">moved</a> from the first reduced rate (15%) to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-235?text=p%C5%99%C3%ADloha%20%C4%8D.%202a">the second</a> reduced rate (10%). However, carriers have made it clear that the reduction in the rate will not bring a reduction in prices. For example, Leo Express spokesman Emil Sedlařík <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/">told</a> Aktuálně.cz: <em>&quot;The reduction in the VAT rate comes at the same time as an increase in the prices of traction electricity, wages and other cost items. Thanks to the reduction in the VAT rate, we can better cover these increased expenses, which will not affect the price of our tickets.&quot;</em> Radek Joklík, spokesman for Czech Railways, made a similar <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/">statement</a> .<br/><br/> For the reasons stated above, we evaluate the statement as true.<br/><br/></p>
