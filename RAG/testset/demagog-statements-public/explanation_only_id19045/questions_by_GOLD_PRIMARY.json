    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: He (Miloš Zeman, note: Demagog.cz) was known to Mr. Sobotka, who first went to the president with the nomination of Mr. Prouza to head the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and when he told Sobotka that he would never appoint Prouza, he came up with another name and did not even propose Prouza. It was the same with my dismissal, which he did not push through, so I resigned myself.\nSECTION B: Why, at a time when no foreign power threatens us or interferes in our affairs, and we, as a state and as citizens, truly have our destiny in our own hands for the first time in centuries, do we have so few reasons for joyful satisfaction? These words were uttered exactly 28 years ago, in 1992, in the New Year&#39;s speech of the then President Václav Havel.\nSECTION C: Look at how we are increasing pensions. Here we are, the coalition government, we haven&#39;t had time yet. And here we are, 2018, 475 crowns and this is the proposal of the minority government of the ANO movement. That, my government, which ruled brilliantly for 205 days, without confidence, but it worked perfectly, is increasing 918 crowns on average per month and another 1,000 crowns for pensioners aged 85. \nSECTION D: On April 24, a petition demanding Stanek&#39;s dismissal was created, and on April 28, the vice-chairman of the ČSSD Onderka began demanding the dismissal of his own minister, contrary to the position of his own chairman. On May 2, I received the petition signatories at the Government Office, and Mr. Hamáček, who stood up for Stanek, was also at the meeting with them.\n\nSECTION E: I requested from the Ministry of Finance a list of goods and services where VAT was reduced during our period. This (passenger transport, note Demagog.cz) was the only item where we did not do it (we did not vote for a VAT reduction, note Demagog.cz), because transport companies would make money from it without it being reflected in reduced fares for people.\nSECTION F: Kateřina Perknerová: But the marginal issue is certainly not the bribery affair at the Ministry of Transport, when former Minister Kremlík did not report the alleged corrupt offer of 1.5 million crowns. Andrej Babiš: He reported it. Kateřina Perknerová: He told the head of the BIS three weeks after the bribe offer. A normal person acts differently, right? Andrej Babiš: That&#39;s true.\n\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
