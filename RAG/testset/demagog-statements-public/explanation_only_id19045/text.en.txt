<p>Vladimír Kremlík <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/vladimir-kremlik-173245/">was</a> Minister of Transport from April 29, 2019 to January 23, 2020.</p><p> Former Minister Kremlík <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/nabidli-mi-uplatek-15-milionu-rekl-kremlik-babis-mlci-ale-bis-to-vi-88094">allegedly</a> met with lawyer Martin Janoušek at the ministry&#39;s headquarters on December 20, 2019. Janoušek allegedly offered a bribe of 1.5 million crowns for CGI to retain oversight of the toll system.</p><p> 25 days later, specifically on January 14, Vladimír Kremlík was supposed to send a report to the director of the Security Information Service about the situation that had arisen. According to the Seznam news server, Vladimír Kremlík was supposed <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3043235-podivna-situace-kremlik-pry-jako-ministr-dostal-korupcni-nabidku-padla-uz-tri-trestni">to file</a> a criminal complaint on Monday, February 3, 2020.</p><p> According to <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/kremlik-odvolani-uplatek-transparency-international-bis-policie_2002041632_aur">the statement</a> of the Transparency International lawyer, the alleged criminal report was filed late. In the interview, it is said that, according to the interpretation of the law, a crime must be reported within a maximum of a few days. Similarly, the commentary to the Criminal Code (Šámal et al., CH Beck, 2012) states that <em>“reporting an act without delay means that a person who has reliably learned that one of the crimes listed in this provision has been committed takes the earliest opportunity to report it.”</em> In any case, <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2009-40#f3921514">the law</a> itself, specifically in Section 368 of the Criminal Code, does not explicitly state the time within which a crime must be reported. However, from the interpretation of the provisions of the Criminal Code, it can be concluded that the former Minister Kremlík did indeed report the crime late.</p><p> As for the actual reporting of a crime, anyone can report a crime. They can do so orally, in writing, electronically or in another way. A crime can be <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2009-40#p368-1">reported</a> to any police authority or to the public prosecutor&#39;s office. Let us therefore focus on whether former Minister Kremlík reported the crime to the relevant authority, or whether his SMS message to the Director of the BIS can be considered a report to a police authority. According to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1961-141#p12-2-f">Section 12, paragraph 2, letter f)</a> of Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Code of Criminal Procedure, a police authority includes, among other things, the authorized bodies of the Security Information Service in proceedings concerning crimes committed by members of the Security Information Service. Since <a href="https://www.bis.cz/inspekce/">the BIS Inspectorate</a> , as a police authority, is directly subordinate to the Director of the BIS, it is valid that Vladimír Kremlík reported the crime to a police authority within the meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p><p> However, in order to evaluate the statement, it is important to clarify whether by the term “reported” Andrej Babiš means reporting a crime under the Criminal Code, or generally passing on information about a suspicion of committing a crime to a third party. Since Andrej Babiš did not use the word “report” as used in criminal law, we assume that by reporting he means a simple communication to another person, not necessarily to an authority involved in criminal proceedings and not necessarily within the time limit required by the Criminal Code. Since, according to the available information, the former Minister Kremlík should have reported his suspicions to the Director of the BIS, and indeed after about three weeks, as Andrej Babiš himself admitted, we evaluate the statement as true.</p>
