<p>The first information about the order for 1.1 million respirators and 5 million masks from China appeared on March 15 on Jan Hamáček&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/jhamacek/status/1239161035816415233">Twitter account</a> .</p><p> According to <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/ministerstvo-zdravotnictvi-neumelo-rousky-objednat-pomohl-ty/r~d5fe94d8689111ea9c800cc47ab5f122/">Aktuálně.cz</a> , this was supposed to happen after Prime Minister Andrej Babiš entrusted the Ministry of the Interior with the purchase of respirators and masks. This is allowed by Act <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-240#p4-1-b">No. 240/2000 Coll.</a> The reason was the inability of the Ministry of Health to order this equipment.</p><p> <i>&quot;So we have a fast payment system and I can tell you that we now have more than 30 million masks, 6 million respirators, 250,000 protective biosuits for doctors and medical staff, and 250,000 glasses and shields paid for and under contract in China. This is something that should fundamentally change the situation.&quot;</i> This was the statement of the Minister of the Interior on March 17 at <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-po-mimoradnem-jednani-vlady--17--brezna-2020-180412/">a press conference</a> after an extraordinary government meeting. According to this statement, the number of equipment ordered from China has increased.</p><p> So far, the latest information with a higher number of protective equipment was heard on March 22 in <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/220411030500322/">Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions</a> (time 26:25).

The only difference here is the number of protective suits, where Info.cz states the number of 300,000, instead of the 250,000 announced by Jan Hamáček.</p><p> Information about the contract for face masks, FFP2 respirators, goggles, protective shields, or disposable tests is not searchable in <a href="https://smlouvy.gov.cz">the contract register</a> .</p>
