    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: Even in the 2017 pre-election strategy, and in the next one, it is clearly defined. We said that we will not go with undemocratic parties or support a government that will use their votes. So at the moment it is SPD or KSČM. And then we set clear conditions and those conditions of cooperation were there. It will not be a government that will have a majority of YES. There will be no people who have a corrupt past or are in a conflict of interest.\nSECTION B: So I&#39;ll just briefly talk about Lukáš Wagenknecht. Andrej Babiš brought him to finance as a top analyst who fights corruption. And Lukáš Wagenknecht started doing his job, and of course Mr. Babiš didn&#39;t like that, so he fired him, he rejected him. Lukáš Wagenknecht was elected for the Pirates in the last election period in the last Senate elections,\nSECTION C: He is on the election committee (Lukáš Wagenknecht, note: Demagog.cz), which elected him himself. There are a lot of people on the election committee. People from the media department, our politicians, regional campaign coordinators, and Lukáš Wagenknecht was elected there as the head who deals with the preparation of the campaign, its financing and coordination.\nSECTION D: EDITOR: He stayed (Jakub Michálek, note: Demagog.cz), but he no longer wanted to run for first vice-chairman. IVAN BARTOŠ: Yes, he did. He announced that sometime in the middle of last year. After all, the focus of his work lies in the parliamentary club, where the chairman of the parliamentary club was elected last week and Jakub Michálek defended him.\nSECTION E: The Central Crisis Staff, which is also required by law, was not created at the very beginning. In fact, the government retained a kind of preferential right to announce its decisions to people, politicians, and companies through press conferences, and only then was the Central Crisis Staff created, which was supposed to be a body consisting of experts, which provides the government with the documents, and based on them, the government takes individual measures.\nSECTION F: EDITOR: But you had a campaign based on a bus, in which you had pictures of various politicians. IVAN BARTOŠ: There was a funny bus, so everyone was in civilian clothes, there were caricatures and people from the Social Democrats were sitting there. People who were in the government for the KDU-ČSL and then for TOP 09, for example, were sitting there.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
