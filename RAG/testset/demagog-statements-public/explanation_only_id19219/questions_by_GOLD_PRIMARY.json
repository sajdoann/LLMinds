    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: There were some property disputes there (at TV NOVA, note: Demagog.cz) and unfortunately we had to pay a fine of 10 billion crowns also because some institution, I don&#39;t know now if it was the media committee of the Chamber of Deputies or someone like that, said that everything was fine. So we agreed to it, and well, it wasn&#39;t fine.\nSECTION B: Danuška, Dana Košanová, my little daughter, go to sleep already. I think that was a poem by Vojtěch Mihálik, who later deserted to the regime, but wrote this beautiful poem at the time. Do you know who Dana Košanová was? She has a monument now and she was shot by a Soviet soldier, no tank, Mr. Soukup, normal shooting. I don&#39;t even know if it was from behind.\nSECTION C: Well, I recommended quite publicly when he was appointed (Minister of Culture Zaorálek, note: Demagog.cz) that he realize that he can have a comfortable life, going from reception to reception, from opening to opening, from festival to festival, but that the Ministry of Culture should take care of dilapidated cultural monuments.\nSECTION D: When I recently told him (the director of the BIS Koudelka, note: Demagog.cz) that he should deal more with economic crime, the BIS spokesperson said that economic crime is not in the BIS job description, which means we have a stupid spokesperson here who doesn&#39;t even know the BIS Act, which includes the obligation to protect the economic interests of the Czech Republic. And tell me, what else but economic crime, including corruption and the fight against it, is the defense of economic interests.\nSECTION E: Let me start the same way I did when I met with about a hundred foreign ambassadors. I said to them: Welcome to a successful country. A country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, that has stable economic growth, that has a relatively declining and relatively low national debt. A country where both the average wage and old-age pensions are growing.\nSECTION F: On the other hand, those who babble that it is nationalization should realize that a similar position was taken by the American administration, which you certainly cannot suspect of Bolshevism. For example, with General Motors. So they entered there and when General Motors got back on its feet, they sold their share again. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
