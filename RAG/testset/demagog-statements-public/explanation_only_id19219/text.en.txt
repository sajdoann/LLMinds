<p>General Motors is an American multinational corporation that is one of the world&#39;s largest car manufacturers. However, it ran into major problems, among other things due to the effects of the global economic crisis of 2008. GM has had enough of its own problems over the past decade, such as a constantly declining market share, with the price per share gradually <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/05/31/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy_looms/index.htm?postversion=2009053112">falling</a> to almost 75 cents. </p><figure class="image"><img src="https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/chart_gm_shrinking.03.gif"><figcaption> Source: <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/">CNN</a></figcaption></figure><p> But the Great Recession also meant that car sales dropped significantly. All of these factors led GM to declare <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/ceska-ekonomika/obri-bankrot-automobilky-je-tu-gm-chce-ochranu/r~i:article:638814/?redirected=1532723355">bankruptcy</a> on June 1, 2009. On the same day, the company filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. The administration of then-President Barack Obama bailed out GM with a nearly $50 billion <a href="https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402">injection</a> of cash, for which it acquired a 60.8% stake in the company. Canada also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1405425-automobilka-general-motors-zbankrotovala">bought</a> part of the company, and the United Auto Workers union bought another part. The United States then gradually sold off this stake, for which it collected $39 billion. The last part of its stake <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/12/09/government-treasury-gm-general-motors-tarp-bailout-exit-sale/3925515/">was sold by</a> the United States in December 2013.</p><p> General Motors remained in bankruptcy for only 39 days and soon returned to the stock market thanks to reorganization. As part of the restructuring, the company <a href="https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402">stopped</a> production of some unprofitable brands such as Hummer, Pontiac and Saturn. The company also closed some of its factories and focused on a narrower selection of brands - such as Chevrolet and Cadillac. The US entry into car manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler ultimately saved 1.5 million jobs. It is estimated that the US <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-bailout-study-idUSL1N0JO0XU20131209">saved</a> $ 105 billion in collecting social security payments and social benefits for people who would have lost their jobs due to the bankruptcy.</p><p> The Czech Republic can help Czech companies in this way. <a href="https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66746670-vlada-hodla-vstoupit-do-vyznamnych-soukromych-firem">According to</a> Deputy Prime Minister Karel Havlíček, this would be a similar model to that outlined by Miloš Zeman using the example of the USA and General Motors. &quot; <i>We call it the American model, it is not socialization, as we are now being criticized a lot.&quot;</i> Many states are trying to save their strategic companies in this way, as are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesasquith/2020/04/01/could-airlines-be-nationalised-as-italy-takes-full-ownership-of-alitalia-will-more-airlines-follow/#59f3640877df">airlines</a> .</p><p> Finance Minister Alena Schillerová and the government of Andrej Babiš have <a href="https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66751220-schillerova-chce-zestatnovat">proposed</a> that shares in some Czech companies, such as CSA, should be bought back and then <a href="https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66749800-deficit-200-miliard-i-pristi-rok">sold</a> again, following the American model. Czech Airlines <a href="https://www.lidovky.cz/byznys/doprava/zachrana-csa-verdikt-zrejme-padne-do-dvou-tydnu.A200416_130657_ln-doprava_ele">is</a> currently 98 percent owned by Smartwings, 49 percent of which is owned by the Chinese state-owned company CITIC. However, this proposal is criticized by many economists and experts who do not consider CSA to be a strategic enterprise, and <a href="https://www.e15.cz/koronahelpdesk-e15/v-cesku-zadna-strategicka-firma-ke-znarodneni-neni-shoduje-se-opozice-s-analytiky-1368824">the opposition</a> is also opposed. Petr Bartoň, the chief economist of the Natland group, compared the situation between CSA and GM for <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/znarodneni-csa-nic-neresi-rika-ekonom-40321128">Novinky.cz</a> : &quot; <i>The management is not in a state of catastrophic failure and it is not an irreplaceable critical infrastructure. CSA was only prohibited from offering its services. There would be demand, but citizens are prohibited from traveling anywhere. This can be solved with existing programs to maintain economic relations for the rest of the economy. That is, if those programs were sufficient.&quot;</i></p>
