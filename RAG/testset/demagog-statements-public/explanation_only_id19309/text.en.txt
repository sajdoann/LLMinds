<p>Minister Dostálová is talking about <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173718">the government bill</a> (.pdf) amending Act <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134/zneni-20191126">No. 134/2016 Coll.</a> , on public procurement. This bill has been submitted to the Chamber of Deputies as Chamber of Deputies Paper <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=862">No. 862.</a> By Government <a href="https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABPJ9RLH6">Resolution No. 534</a> (.pdf) of Monday, May 11 (4 days before the interview), the Government requested that this bill be discussed in a shortened session, and the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Radek Vondráček, <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173719&amp;pdf=1">granted</a> the request (.pdf).</p><p> According to <a href="https://www.psp.cz/docs/laws/1995/90.html#99">Section 99</a> of the Act on the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies, an abbreviated session in a state of legislative emergency means omitting the first reading of the bill, the possibility of omitting the general debate, and the possibility of limiting the time of individual deputies at the rostrum in the plenary session. It also gives the Speaker of the Chamber the opportunity to order the Guarantee Committee a deadline by which the committee must submit a resolution on the given proposal.</p><p> This resolution was issued by the guarantee committee, i.e. the committee for public administration and regional development, at meeting <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173728&amp;pdf=1">No. 39</a> (.pdf, invitation) on May 13, 2020 at 10:00. Here, it issued resolution <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173897&amp;pdf=1">No. 203</a> (.pdf) on the proposal, in which it proposes to the Chamber of Deputies to hold a general debate, conduct a detailed debate on all parts of the proposal and conclude the discussion on the proposal by 24:00 on the same day, i.e. Wednesday, May 13, 2020. At the same time, it recommends that the PS approve the proposal.</p><p> Before the start of the Chamber of Deputies&#39; session on May 13 (which <a href="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/048schuz/s048001.htm">began</a> at 3:00 p.m.), press conferences were held by the parliamentary groups. From <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=1509">the regular order</a> of speeches by the individual parties in the press atrium and the recording <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/p...220411058330513">of the Czech Television broadcast</a> from that day, we conclude that at the original time of its press conference (2:40 p.m.), the ANO parliamentary group was still deliberating.</p><p> At 12:30, Martin Kolovratník, a member of parliament for ANO, <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=862">uploaded</a> his <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176886">amendment (.docx) to the proposed amendment</a> to the parliamentary system. At 14:16, member of parliament Pekarová Adamová (TOP 09) uploaded her amendment <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176892">No. 5248</a> (.docx) and at about the time of the press conference, i.e. at 14:43, 3 more amendments <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176896">No. 5251</a> (.docx), <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176898">No. 5252</a> (.docx) and <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176900">No. 5253</a> (.docx) from member of parliament Profant (Pirates) were already uploaded to the system. As early as May 12, there was <a href="http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176872">amendment No. 5225</a> (.docx) from member of parliament Jelínek (SPD). At the time when the ANO parliamentary group was in session, several amendments to the government amendment to the law had already been uploaded to the parliamentary system.</p><p> <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/ischuze.sqw?o=8&amp;s=48&amp;pozvanka=1">Originally,</a> the agenda of this meeting was to discuss the aforementioned government proposal. Right at the beginning of the meeting, deputies Michálek, Pikal (Pirates), Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) and Okamura (SPD) spoke out against this point. <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/detail.sqw?id=6190">Deputy Faltýnek</a> (chairman of the ANO parliamentary group) responded <a href="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/048schuz/s048002.htm">by announcing</a> that at the meeting of the parliamentary group, after which they did not have time to announce this decision to the media at a press conference, they agreed not to discuss this proposal in a state of legislative emergency (in an abbreviated meeting) and to postpone its regular discussion to the next meeting. At the proposal of deputy Michálek, this point was eliminated <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=72987">by vote</a> no. 3 with the support of 101 out of 107 registered deputies (6 abstained). The next 49th meeting of the PS is scheduled for May 26, 2020, and the first reading of the proposal is tentatively <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/ischuze.sqw?o=8&amp;s=49&amp;pozvanka=1">scheduled</a> there as point no. 76.</p><p> The gradual recording of amendments could therefore have been one of the reasons why the ANO parliamentary group supported the discussion of the law in the standard procedure.</p>
