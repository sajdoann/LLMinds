    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: Tomáš PANCÍŘ, moderator: In the end, your parliamentary group, the parliamentary group of the ANO movement, agreed to postpone the discussion (of the amendments to the Public Procurement Act, note: Demagog.cz) until the regular meeting. Why did you, as ANO, withdraw? (…) Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: (…) Other amendments and suggestions began to be made (…)\nSECTION B: What we disagree on is that the Ministry of the Interior actually calculated it as if we were building all the offices on a green field, as if there were no construction procedures here. So of course it calculated the new offices for civil servants at 30 billion crowns. Nothing like that will happen and I am sorry that the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior does not state that the state currently pays municipalities for the civil servants who handle construction procedures, for the rental of those rooms, for overheads, and so on. It is not a small amount. The state pays municipalities 4 billion a year. And of that, 360 million is roughly for overheads and rent.\nSECTION C: This partial amendment was really only intended to speed up procedures and remove the administrative burden in the so-called negotiated procedure without publication, which is really only for two reasons, that is, we did not change anything in the law, only the negotiated procedure without publication due to extremely urgent circumstances, or if there is only one supplier.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
