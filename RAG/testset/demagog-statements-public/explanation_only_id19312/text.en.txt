<p>The statement by the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová, relates to the amendment to the Public Procurement Act <a href="https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABPJ9RLH6">approved</a> by the government.</p><p> The Minister states that the main reason for submitting the amendment is the effort to speed up procedures and eliminate administrative burdens, which, according to her, is to be adjusted by changing the so-called negotiation procedure without publication. At the request of the government, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies decided that this <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=862">proposal</a> will be discussed in a state of legislative emergency, which significantly limits the legislative process. The amendment is currently on the agenda of the meeting from May 26, 2020.</p><p> <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173714">The explanatory memorandum</a> (.pdf, p. 3) of the amendment to the law states:</p><p> &quot; <i>The proposed amendment removes administrative obstacles to the award of contracts in negotiated procedures without publication so that negotiated procedures without publication based on Section 63, paragraphs 3 and 5 can be implemented in the shortest possible time.</i> &quot;</p><p> And he further comments on the need for adjustments due to the situation caused by the COVID-19 epidemic:</p><p> <i>&quot;It is necessary to ensure that the negotiated procedure, which is awarded in extremely urgent circumstances, is as administratively demanding as possible. Given the need to conclude the contract as quickly as possible, <strong>it is not appropriate to insist on actions to ensure the qualification of the supplier</strong> , convene an evaluation committee, or prevent the conclusion of the contract, as the public interest in the rapid performance of the public contract prevails here.&quot;</i></p><p> The key amendment is in Section 67, which regulates the procedure (ibid., p. 1). The following paragraph is added to the current wording:</p><p> <i><strong>&quot;(3) In the case of negotiated proceedings without publication pursuant to Section 63(3) and (5), Section 48(7) and (9), Section 73, Section 86 and Section 122 shall not apply.&quot;</strong></i></p><p> This point deserves further explanation, as it contains the changes that are to be made. According to paragraphs 3 and 5 <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p63">of Section 63</a> , the following applies:</p><ul><li> <i>“The contracting authority may also use a negotiated procedure without publication if the public contract can only be performed by a particular supplier (…)”</i></li><li> <i>“The contracting authority may also use the negotiated procedure without publication if this is necessary as a result of extremely urgent circumstances which the contracting authority could not have foreseen and which it did not cause (…)”</i></li></ul><p> The proposed amendment to the law is therefore intended to allow certain requirements of the law not to be applied in cases of a negotiated procedure without publication, if there is not a large number of suppliers on the market or if there are urgent circumstances for this procedure. The key issue, however, is which requirements of the law will not have to be complied with in these cases.</p><p> As a result of the new Section 67, paragraph 3, access to contracts in the negotiated procedure without publication is simplified, for example, for companies that do not have book-entry shares (they do not have to have a clear ownership structure), which is regulated in the current version by <a href="	https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p48-7">Section 48, paragraphs 7</a> and <a href="	https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p48-9">9.</a> Companies do not have to submit documents on qualification pursuant to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p86">Section 86</a> , and in the case of legal entities, the contracting authority does not have to ascertain information about its beneficial owner pursuant to <a href="	https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p122-4">Section 122, paragraph 4.</a> At the same time, one of the basic criteria for selecting a supplier pursuant to this Act is abolished - namely, the one that provides the most economically advantageous tender pursuant to <a href="	https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p122-1">Section 122, paragraph 1</a> .</p><p> It is therefore clear that these changes will significantly simplify the process of awarding public contracts through negotiated procedures without publication. However, Transparency International Czech Republic <a href="https://www.transparency.cz/vlada-ve-stavu-nouze-navrhuje-novelu-zakona-o-zadavani-verejnych-zakazek-ktera-otevira-dvere-miliardovym-skodam-a-ohrozuje-bezpecnost-cr/">lists</a> a number of consequences that the adoption of the amendment may have. These include, for example, suspicious purchases and potential financial damage to the state caused by providing freedom in the negotiated procedure without publication. The Ministry of Regional Development, in turn, <a href="https://mmr.cz/cs/ostatni/web/novinky/mmr-novela-zakona-o-verejnych-zakazkach-zajisti-r">argues for</a> the need to simplify the administratively overly complex procedure.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because the justification of the amendment to the Public Procurement Act and its content clearly show the goal of simplifying and accelerating the award of public contracts in cases falling under tender procedures without publication. However, this fact does not call into question the criticism directed at the discussed amendment. The amendment to the Act may be perceived as potentially dangerous.</p>
