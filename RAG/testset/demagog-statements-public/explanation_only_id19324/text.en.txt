<p>Vít Rakušan is talking here about the statement of the chairman of the KSČM, Vojtěch Filip, who, in <a href="http://redstar.ru/vojteh-filip-bolshinstvo-grazhdan-cheshskoj-respubliki-vot-uzhe-75-let-ispytyvayut-chuvstvo-blagodarnosti-k-krasnoj-armii-2/">an interview</a> published on May 15, 2020 by the Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, stated:</p><p> <i>“(…) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [is] departing from the national position when it criticizes the Russian Federation for not yet restoring war memorials on its territory to the fallen Czechoslovak legionnaires who fought in Samara, near Lipiag near Novokuybyshev and in other places in Russia with Russian revolutionary communists in 1918.</i></p><p> <i>Members of the KSČM and other citizens of the Czech Republic positively perceive the fact that the Russian government does not show interest in forcing local authorities to build monuments to those Czech legionnaires who did not liberate anyone in Russia and did nothing good for the most brilliant world socialist revolution of the last century in 1917 in Russia.”</i></p><p> The mentioned legionnaires who fought in <a href="http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:b5c8164d-afea-4a70-b22a-624680b5fdef?page=uuid:88aa7912-10f7-11e8-b8ac-005056b73ae5">Samara</a> on the Volga in June 1918 (PLESKÝ, Metoděj. <i>4th Regiment of Prokop the Great</i> . 1936, p. 219) and at the Lipjagi station in the nearby city of Novokuybyshevsk (ibid., pp. 202–203) are soldiers of the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý and <a href="http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:dde50707-6b59-4eef-a3d6-916586657465?page=uuid:cefb781e-0fc9-11e8-ad37-005056b73ae5&amp;fulltext=samara">the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi</a> (LANGER, František. <i>Memorial Book of the 1st Rifle Regiment of Jan Husi.</i> 1920, p. 44). They defeated the Bolshevik troops here, with whom they came into conflict mainly because the Russian side did not comply with the agreement on the departure of the Czechoslovak legionnaires via Vladivostok to France. Tomáš Jakl, a historian at the Military Historical Institute, <a href="http://www.vhu.cz/co-se-odehravalo-behem-velke-valky-na-vychodni-fronte/">states</a> :</p><p> <i>&quot;However, at the end of April 1918, the transportation of Czechoslovak transports practically stopped due to pressure from Germany. In addition, at the end of May, the Soviet government attempted to completely disarm the Czechoslovak corps and transfer the Czechoslovaks either to the Red Army or to labor units. The Czechoslovak soldiers responded to this attempt by deciding to leave for Vladivostok on their own.&quot;</i></p><p> Before the beginning of the conflicts with the Bolsheviks, these Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia had already achieved a number of military successes in battles with the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. In March 1918, for example, the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý took part in the Battle of <a href="http://www.vhu.cz/exhibit/ruske-legie-v-bitve-u-bachmace-1918/">Bachmač</a> , where an important railway junction was located. And above all, the soldiers of the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi fought victoriously at <a href="http://www.vhu.cz/zborov-bitva-ktera-cs-vojakum-vydobyla-respekt/">Zborov</a> in early July 1917.</p><p> Currently, both cities are located in Ukraine, and at the time of the fighting, Bachmač was part of the independent <a href="http://www.haidamaka.org.ua/obr/sxslob/mapaunr.jpg">Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic</a> and Zborov was part of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Europe_1918.jpg">the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</a> However, it is important to mention that, for example, Bachmač was still part of <a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/map-russian-empire-1914">the Russian Empire</a> at the beginning of World War I. Let us add that at Zborov, the entire Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade was directly subordinated to the Russian <a href="https://kramerius.army.cz/search/i.jsp?pid=uuid:0fee9338-6380-4fab-8551-ecef91c582d5&amp;q=&amp;fq=document_type:%22monograph%22&amp;fq=keywords:%221.%20%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A1%20d%C4%9Blost%C5%99eleck%C3%A1%20brig%C3%A1da%22#monograph-page_uuid:51ea50b3-0fc3-11e8-927a-005056b73ae5">49th Army Corps</a> (KAVENA, Karel. <i>History of the 1st Artillery Regiment of Jan Žižka of Trocnov in the Russian Revolution and in the Fatherland</i> . 1937, p. 44). It is also an indisputable fact that the 4th and 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiments, with their work (along with many others), helped Russia to achieve final victory on the Eastern European battlefield.</p><p> According to historians, the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian army near the town of Zborov also <a href="https://books.google.cz/books?id=li-2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=v%C3%BDznam+zborova+samostatn%C3%A9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkOxi0hmPp&amp;sig=ACfU3U2orK3G_vX83GzgA2tpeU7ffHK1ew&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiv3P358sfpAhXJ8OAKHZvtAqQQ6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A9%20st%C3%A1tn%C3%AD%20samostatnosti&amp;f=false">played</a> (MOJŽÍŠ, Milan, RAK, Michal et al. <i>Zborov 1917–2017</i> . 2019, p. 150) along with other combat actions of Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia a very <a href="http://www.acr.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=11914">important role</a> in political negotiations on the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak Republic. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Zborov in 2017, for example, the Chamber of Deputies adopted <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=10179">a resolution</a> that ends with the words: <i>&quot;The deeds of the legionnaires should never be forgotten. The heroes of Zborov have contributed to the state.&quot;</i></p><p> For these reasons, Vojtěch Filip&#39;s statement can to some extent be considered as questioning the historical role of these units, as Vít Rakušan states in the statement. However, it is clear from the statement that Vojtěch Filip directly questioned the role of the legionnaires in the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia. Filip spoke only about their importance for Russia and the revolution in Russia. Rakušan thus presents Filip&#39;s statement in a misleading context.</p>
