    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: (...) but to question within the Russian Federation, within their media space, the role of our legionnaires in history – those who simply stood as one of the first for the freedom of Czechoslovakia, for the fact that we had the first democratic state, the so often invoked first republic – and he dares to question it (Vojtěch Filip, note: Demagog.cz).\nSECTION B: I read the article in translation, or rather the interview with Mr. Vice-Chairman Filip, he was of course described in the Russian military magazine as the Vice-Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, he was not there only as the Chairman of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia. He acted as one of the highest constitutional officials and that is how he spoke for that medium.\nSECTION C: After all, in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions, Jan Hamáček also expressed that at least that part of the resolution that I proposed and where we say that the legionnaires as such are simply those who have contributed to our state, and that should not be questioned and the Chamber of Deputies supports that, so he is ready to support that part of the resolution.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
