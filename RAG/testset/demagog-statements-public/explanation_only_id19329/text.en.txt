This happened after General Vlasov <a href="https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach">was captured</a> by the Germans during the defense of Leningrad. The ROA <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/veda-technologie/historie/ustr-historik-historie-osvobozeni-cesko-rusko-vlasovci_1912141111_hag">members</a> included Soviet prisoners of war and the so-called white emigration, or people who left the USSR in the 1920s and decided to fight against Stalin. Their main <a href="https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach">goal</a> was to defeat Stalin. Germany was to help them achieve these goals. On the side of Nazi Germany, <a href="https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473">they fought</a> against the USSR in the area between the Oder and the Neisse.</p><p> However, in the spring of 1945, it became <a href="https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473">clear</a> to Vlasov (audio, time from 15:30) that he could not count on Germany&#39;s help in the long-term fight against Stalin. On the contrary, the Germans were rather using Vlasov&#39;s army for their own purposes. For this reason, he decided to leave Germany with his army for Linz. In an attempt to win the favor of the Allied (or American) troops, he then decided, together with General Bunyachenko, to help liberate Prague.</p><p> <a href="https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/zradci-a-vrazi-nebo-zneuznani-osvoboditele-diskuze-o-vyznamu-kontroverznich-8121440">They arrived</a> in Prague on May 5, 1945.
