<p>Vít Rakušan talks about the resolution in connection with <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/babisuv-odhalil-ze-si-tiskne-vladni-maily-ve-firme-ze-sverenskych-fondu-98372">the case of</a> Prime Minister Babiš from the beginning of April. During his regular <a href="https://youtu.be/2SwQpWtZTQE?t=332">weekend report</a> (video) on his YouTube channel, Andrej Babiš read information about the financing of the health sector from a piece of paper on which an e-mail addressed to the Prime Minister from the Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, was printed on the other side. Minister Vojtěch sent the message to the Prime Minister&#39;s private e-mail address, who then forwarded it to an employee of the IMOBA company, who printed it for him.</p><p> <a href="https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vysledky?subjektId=713630&amp;typ=PLATNY">IMOBA</a> is a member of the SynBiol concern, which is part of Andrej Babiš&#39;s <a href="https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66371830-kdo-je-kdo-ve-sverenskych-fondech-pres-ktere-podle-expertu-babis-dal-ovlada-agrofert-dulezite-funkce-maji-premierovi-pravnici-i-manzelka">trust fund</a> called AB private trust I. The video also shows that Prime Minister Babiš uses his personal address with the domain &quot;e-babis.cz&quot; for government email communication. In response to the video, a wave of criticism arose, firstly, regarding the Prime Minister&#39;s continuing ties to his former trust companies and secondly, due to the way the Prime Minister operates with potentially sensitive government information on unsecured email addresses.</p><p> The 37th meeting of the House Committee on Security took place on May 14. According to its <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173747&amp;pdf=1">invitation</a> (.pdf), the deputies were to discuss the 5th item <i>&quot;Securing government materials when using private e-mail addresses by the Prime Minister and members of the government&quot;.</i> This item was proposed by Vít Rakušan, and the head of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security Karel Řehka was also invited to comment. It is true that due to time constraints, this item <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-e-maily-soukroma-posta-imoba-bezpecnostni-vybor-poslanci-snemovna_2005190600_kno">was not</a> discussed and was postponed to the next meeting of the House of Representatives, which is scheduled to take place at the end of May.</p><p> This particular meeting of the Security Committee was not public according to <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173747&amp;pdf=1">the invitation</a> and no <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4905&amp;ido=1311&amp;kk=4&amp;td=3&amp;n=2">minutes</a> or <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4905&amp;ido=1311&amp;kk=5&amp;td=1&amp;n=9">resolutions</a> have been made available yet. Therefore, we cannot verify whether the draft resolution that Vít Rakušan mentions actually contained information regarding the methodology of internet communication of government members.</p>
