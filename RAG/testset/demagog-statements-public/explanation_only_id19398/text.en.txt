<p>In his statement, Andrej Babiš <a href="https://www.euroskop.cz/8917/sekce/zakladajici-smlouvy/">uses</a> the old name of the currently valid Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Treaty of Lisbon changed the name of <a href="http://www.euroskop.cz/gallery/2/756-smlouva_o_es_nice.pdf">the Treaty establishing the European Community</a> to the aforementioned <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN">Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</a> In this case, this is only a minor error; moreover, Prime Minister Babiš correctly quotes Article 311, which is found in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU):</p><p> <i>&quot;</i> <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN"><i>Article 311</i></a></p><p> <i>The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to achieve its objectives and to successfully implement its policies.</i></p><p> <i>The budget is financed entirely from own resources; other revenues are not affected.</i></p><p> In accordance with the ruling, the European Union <a href="https://www.respekt.cz/agenda/prevratny-navrh-unie-si-chce-spolecne-pujcit-na-obnovu-ekonomiky-po-koronaviru">has not previously borrowed</a> , because, in addition to the fact that, according to Article 311 TFEU, the Union manages only its own resources, according to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN">Article 125</a> TFEU, <i>&quot;The Union</i> <i>shall not be liable for or assume the obligations of central governments, regional or local authorities or other public bodies, other bodies governed by public law or public undertakings of any Member State, except in the case of mutual financial guarantees for the joint implementation of a specific project.&quot;</i> Furthermore, according to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN">Article 310 TFEU,</a> <i>&quot;the EU budget must be in balance in terms of revenue and expenditure.&quot;</i> These norms of EU primary law <a href="https://finmag.penize.cz/ekonomika/417060-unie-si-jde-pujcit-na-financni-trhy-my-nic-my-eu-to-nejaky-fond-z-bruselu">prohibit</a> EU loans that would adversely affect a balanced EU budget, or a loan to secure the financing of Member States for which the EU is responsible (the EU does not assume the obligations of Member States).</p><p> The European Union as a whole cannot borrow for the time being. However, this does not apply to the European Investment Bank (EIB), which uses the loan to carry out its tasks. However, it is clear from the context of the statement that Andrej Babiš is talking about loans from the EU as a whole and not about the EIB, which has its own legal personality:</p><ul><li> <i>&quot;Article 308 TFEU</i><br> <i>The European Investment Bank shall have legal personality.&#39;</i><br></li><li> Protocol (No 5) to the TFEU on the Statute of the European Investment Bank<br> <i>&quot;</i> <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A12016E%2FPRO%2F05"><i>Article 20</i></a><br> <i>1. The Bank borrows the funds necessary to carry out its tasks on the capital market.</i><br> <i>2. The Bank may borrow on the capital markets of the Member States within the framework of the legal provisions governing those markets.</i><br> <i>The competent authorities of a Member State with a derogation within the meaning of Article 139(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union may refuse consent only if there is a risk of serious disturbances on the capital market of that State.’</i></li></ul><p> The European Commission is eligible to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-financial-assistance/eu-borrower_en">borrow</a> on behalf of the EU from the capital markets to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/how-does-eu-finance-its-financial-assistance_en">finance</a> loan programmes intended to provide assistance to countries in need. Loan programmes include balance of payments assistance, the European Stability Mechanism and financial assistance to non-EU countries. Assistance is <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/policies/financial-assistance-eurozone-members/">provided</a> mainly because of the interconnectedness of the economies of the countries and therefore the potential negative impact of a dysfunctional economy of the affected country. In these cases, the Commission acts only as a kind of intermediary between the capital markets and the Member State, where these funds are not used to finance the operation of the Union, but are provided, again as a loan, to the Member State. In contrast, in the case of financing the Next Generation EU programme, the funds are to be used to finance the operation of the Union, or rather to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/about_the_european_commission/eu_budget/2020.2139_cs_04.pdf">finance</a> subsidies to Member States.</p><p> For the reasons described above, we evaluate the statement as true.</p>
