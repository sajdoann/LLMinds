<p>Representatives of the ANO movement are part of the Renew Europe (formerly ALDE) faction in the European Parliament. No internal communication regarding the European Parliament resolution on the conflict of interest of Andrej Babiš has been published. In general, the Renew Europe faction has not commented on this topic on its <a href="https://reneweuropegroup.eu/en/news/">website</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RenewEurope/">social networks</a> or otherwise. Of the total number of <a href="https://reneweuropegroup.eu/en/about-us/our-meps/">98</a> MEPs in this faction, 72 MEPs voted for the entire resolution ( <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/PV-9-2020-06-19-RCV_FR.pdf">.pdf, p. 316</a> ).</p><p> Only the statement of MEP and member of this faction Radka Maxová is available. In an interview with Seznam Zprávy, she <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/babisova-europoslankyne-resim-jestli-setrvani-v-ano-je-pro-me-jeste-unosne-109740">stated</a> that she did not agree with voting on the resolution as a whole, and that it would be appropriate to vote on certain parts ( <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2020-0164_CS.html">part A and paragraphs 11, 14, 20, 21, 49</a> ) separately.</p><p> Whether there were discussions within the faction about whether it would be appropriate to vote on certain parts separately and whether the faction supported this proposal cannot be verified due to the lack of sources. However, in the end it was indeed <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/cs/press-room/20200615IPR81227/parlament-zada-vysetreni-mozneho-stretu-zajmu-ceskeho-premiera">a resolution</a> as a whole.</p>
