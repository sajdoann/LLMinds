<p>A police <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/brno-policie-zasah-urad_1903070859_pj">raid</a> by the National Headquarters against Organized Crime (NCOZ) took place at the Brno-Střed city hall on March 7, 2019. In connection with this raid, nine people were immediately <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/brno-stred-zasah-razie-policie-obvineni-ano_1903080614_ako">charged</a> , led by Jiří Švachula (ANO movement), the former deputy mayor of this city district. This case, now known as Stoka, is said to involve the misuse of public contracts for bribes. A more detailed insight into the case is provided by <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1142743803-reporteri-ct/219452801240016/">Reportéři ČT</a> (broadcast on May 6, 2019) in the first part of the program (time 1:02 to 17:40), where they talk about the creation of a corruption system in which the city hall management manipulates the awarding of public contracts for apartment repairs in favor of certain construction companies, who in return pay them 10% of the contract value in cash. The total amount of contracts affected in this way is supposed to have reached 180 million crowns. In order for the town hall to tailor the contract to a specific company, the Brno-střed town hall was to use one specific company, which purposefully prepared the tender conditions in such a way that a specific construction company would win. For the tender conditions prepared in this way, the company was to receive 2% of the total volume of the contract. The Stoka case is still the subject of a police investigation, the information provided by the ČT Reportéři program is drawn from individual resolutions on charges and from certain witnesses. As of July 8 of this year, according to the Aktuálně.cz server, a total of 37 people and one company had already <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/kauza-stoka-se-rozleva-dale-policie-obvinila-z-korupce-dalsi/r~081076dac10c11eab115ac1f6b220ee8/">been charged</a> in the Stoka case.</p><p> In connection with this case and other possible corruption scandals or the connection of certain ANO members to &quot;questionable groups&quot;, the Brno presidium of ANO, headed by Petr Vokřál, <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/brno/zpravy/predsednictvo-ano-brnenske-organizace-zruseni-zidenice-cernovice-stary-liskovec.A200305_191413_brno-zpravy_zuf">dissolved</a> the Brno cells in Židenice, Černovice and Starý Lískovec on March 5, 2020. In connection with the dissolution of these local organizations, the membership of 37 members was terminated. In May, the presidium of the ANO movement (the nationwide leadership of ANO) reversed this decision to dissolve the Brno organizations and decided to <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ano-jedna-o-zrusenych-brnenskych-bunkach-i-clenstvi-faltynka-jr-40324100">resume</a> their activities. The reason given was that the dissolution was not carried out procedurally correctly and that the blanket dissolution of membership for all 37 members was too radical a solution. At the same time as this revocation of the Brno resolution on dissolution, the membership of Jiří Faltýnek (son of Jaroslav Faltýnek) in the ANO movement was <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ano-jedna-o-zrusenych-brnenskych-bunkach-i-clenstvi-faltynka-jr-40324100">suspended</a> . Jiří Faltýnek is often associated in the media with the corruption case in Brno-střed. However, he has not yet been charged.</p><p> At the beginning of June, Petr Vokřál, the vice-chairman of the ANO movement, former mayor and candidate for governor of the South Moravian Region, <a href="https://www.lidovky.cz/domov/mistopredseda-ano-petr-vokral-ve-strane-konci-oduvodnil-to-udajnym-napojenim-brnenske-bunky-na-podsv.A200601_184743_ln_domov_ele?zdroj=vybava_recombee">announced</a> that he was leaving the movement. The reason was that <i>he “no longer wants to associate his name with people who use the ANO movement only for their own personal gain and who thus destroy the good work of colleagues who have already managed to do a lot of good work.”</i> Petr Vokřál was one of the initiators of the dissolution of the three Brno cells mentioned above. Two weeks after Petr Vokřál’s resignation, the leadership of the ANO movement decided to <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/brno-zruseni-organizace-hnuti-ano-predsednictvo_2006161352_cen">dissolve</a> the entire Brno organization.</p><p> The police raid in March 2019 was a kind of media trigger for the investigation of corruption in Brno by politicians of the ANO movement. Only then do we learn from individual articles that this corrupt behavior can be dated back to 2016. For example, investigative journalist Janek Kroupa talks about this in an article for <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/brno-korupce-jiri-svachula-podnikatele-faltynek_1903082045_jak">iRozhlas</a> , in which he criticizes the lax approach of the police, who allegedly had evidence of corruption from wiretapping for three years. He wrote about this in more detail in the autumn of 2018 for the magazine <a href="https://reportermagazin.cz/a/irEbn/brnenske-ano-akdo-ridi-politiky-my">Reportér.</a></p><p> Signals of corruption before the police raid, as mentioned above, are therefore traceable. The police raid took place in March 2019, so approximately one and a quarter years have actually passed since it. The closure of the three Brno organizations took place at the beginning of March of this year. Radka Maxová thus made an inaccuracy when she confused March with February. However, we assess this inaccuracy as minor and therefore assess the entire statement as true.</p>
