    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: I have already initiated the re-establishment of the Disability Intergroup, which is a group for people with disabilities. I have obtained the signatures of several dozen colleagues from all factions. All committees are represented there. We have already had two meetings where we agreed on the basic parameters. The group should be established at the beginning of next year. And it is currently cooperating very closely with the European Commission and other organizations that deal with this issue.\nSECTION B: The faction supported the proposal of the ANO delegation for a special vote on the individual articles that were controversial. They supported that we would express support for this separate vote, but there was a lot of talk from the majority of the faction, from members who discussed that we are a faction that is based on values, on democracy, on respect for the rule of law, and that therefore the majority intends, regardless of the outcome of the vote on those articles, to vote for the resolution.\nSECTION C: For example, when parental leave was increasing, I pointed out during the negotiations that this very directive that we were talking about, the reconciliation of family and work life, was approaching us, and that there would be a big change in maternity leave. And that it would be necessary to talk about a systemic change and work it into it. Well, I was not heard from either side, so we have now increased the parental allowance in one go.\nSECTION D: From the indications that I have read, it is evident that there were signals even before Mr. Švachula&#39;s arrest. Of course, things are different now that the police have gotten involved, but it has been a year and a quarter since the police actually started investigating, and only now, sometime in February, if I remember correctly, was the dissolution or expulsion of the three organizations discussed. \nSECTION E: Spěváčková: And the amount of 80 thousand (increase in parental allowance, Demagog.cz) is also okay for you? Maxová: It was in the coalition agreement. Spěváčková: There were big disputes about that, how to actually increase it. Maxová: There were disputes about how it would actually be calculated, who would get it, whether it would be divided into two amounts, twice 40 thousand or a one-time amount. I advocated a one-time amount.\nSECTION F: It follows from Mr. Vokřál&#39;s latest interviews that he also wanted to dissolve after the 3 organizations were not actually dissolved, so he wanted to dissolve the whole of Brno, then I don&#39;t know what happened in the leadership that they didn&#39;t actually dissolve the 3 organizations, the resolution was revoked and it&#39;s not that Mr. Andrej Babiš said he would dissolve it, but Petr Vokřál... proposed it and of course it happened.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
