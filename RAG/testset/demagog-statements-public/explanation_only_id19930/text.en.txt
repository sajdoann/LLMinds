<p>First of all, let us state that Jan Hamáček responds to this statement by Vít Rakušan with another <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/19933">statement</a> . Both statements concern similar matters and at first glance, the two statements may be mutually exclusive. However, the factual statements contained in the statements are different; here we focused on whether (all) preparatory steps based on Pavel Řehák&#39;s recommendations were carried out over the summer.</p><p> Vít Rakušan talks here about <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/muze-s-tabulkou-uz-podruhe-neposlechli-pak-cesko-zaskocila-druha-vlna-125528">Pavel Řehák&#39;s</a> team, which at the end of May 2020 created <a href="https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY">a document</a> (.pdf) entitled &quot;Rapid Response System for a Possible Second Wave of the Covid-19 Epidemic and Other Epidemics&quot;. This material recommends 32 specific steps that need to be taken to minimize the impact of the next wave of Covid-19 on the health of the population and the economy. Let us add that Pavel Řehák <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/muze-s-tabulkou-uz-podruhe-neposlechli-pak-cesko-zaskocila-druha-vlna-125528">sent</a> the aforementioned document to Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and other ministers on May 26.</p><p> In short, the material calls for rapid data evaluation, a rapid response in the implementation of epidemiological measures, and a massive increase in testing capacities, or rather, ensuring a system that will then be able to handle a large number of tests. It also calls for the creation of a central call center, which will allow for a multiple increase in the capacities of regional hygiene stations and enable effective tracing of the infected even with higher numbers of infected people.</p><p> This advisory document also points out that the current Pandemic Plan of the Czech Republic ( <a href="https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/wepub/5520/14546/Pandemick%C3%BD%20pl%C3%A1n%20%C4%8CR.pdf">.pdf</a> ) was created for an influenza <a href="https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY">epidemic</a> (.pdf, p. 13) and needs to be updated, through the Central Epidemiological Commission (.pdf, p. 7 et seq.).</p><p> The Central Epidemiological Commission did not really meet &quot;in the summer months&quot;, as Vít Rakušan states in his statement. Its meetings were held in <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/o-koronaviru-bude-dnes-jednat-ustredni-epidemiologicka-komise-vojtech-zdravotnictvi.A200227_085552_domaci_lre">February</a> , <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/cisla-rostla-ministr-vojtech-dal-klicove-komisi-ctyri-mesice-prazdnin-119731">March</a> and April. It then met on May 15, but the next meeting did not take place until <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/ustredni-epidemiologicka-komise-bude-jednat-o-covidu-19/1932645">September 17, 2020.</a> The fact that the Central Epidemiological Commission did not meet in the summer was even described as a mistake by Prime Minister <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/babis-byla-chyba-ze-se-epidemiologicka-komise-v-lete-nesesla/1934219">Andrej Babiš</a> .</p><p> Among other recommendations that Pavel Řehák&#39;s material contained and that did not &quot;run&quot; during the summer months, one can select, for example, the aforementioned establishment of a central call center for tracing contacts of infected people ( <a href="https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY">.pdf</a> , p. 8). On September 14, 2020, the then Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/hygienikum-ma-ulehcit-call-centrum-mozna-nekdy-na-podzim-planuje-vojtech-119777">stated</a> that its creation would take place <i>&quot;during the autumn&quot;</i> . Let us add that regional hygiene stations began to have problems with <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/napor-na-hygieny-sili-ktere-kraje-nestihaji-trasovat-121213">tracking</a> in the second half of August. With the situation worsening, in October, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/hygiena-trasovani-firmy-vyzva-call-centra-trasovani_2010111124_tzr">called on</a> Czech companies to have their call center employees help regional hygiene stations with tracing.</p><p> Another recommendation that the government did not implement in the summer months is to ensure higher <a href="https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY">testing capacities</a> (.pdf, pages 20 and 21). The Czech Republic only reached the recommended numbers of 30–50 thousand tests per day almost in <a href="https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19">mid-</a> October.</p>
