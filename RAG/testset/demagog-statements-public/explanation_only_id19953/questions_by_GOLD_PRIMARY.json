    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: Zuzana TVARŮŽKOVÁ: Can you imagine that in such a country there could exist, let&#39;s say, a comparable form of democracy to which we are accustomed here in the European Union? Jan HAMÁČEK: Well, if you look at the countries surrounding Afghanistan, you will have a hard time finding a country that would even remotely come close to what we are accustomed to in Europe, that is a very high bar indeed.\nSECTION B: Let&#39;s remember March, April, when Italy and Spain called for help. I remember how the Spanish Hercules arrived, which we loaded with protective suits, material aid was sent to Italy, North Macedonia received a million masks from us, we lent material to Slovenia, we helped the Slovaks build an air bridge.\nSECTION C: We pointed out that when it&#39;s from one plane, when firefighters are going to that region, because they&#39;re taking care of other regional hospitals, social care institutions, and so on, because that&#39;s the task of the regional distribution, it doesn&#39;t seem logical to us that the fire brigade convoy should be followed by a convoy from the Ministry of Health, or rather the army, which is transporting it for them, carrying the same thing from the same plane to more or less the same place.\nSECTION D: (...) bed capacity has been drastically increased recently, it will simply be increased by the fact that hospitals are gradually postponing any postponeable procedures and de facto almost all hospitals are switching to the Covid regime, so according to what Professor Černý is reporting, there should be enough beds at least in the foreseeable future, the problem will be with the staff.\n\nSECTION E: We ordered and paid for 77,000,000 face masks in China, which are actually masks that are worn over the mouth. We ordered and paid for 8.6 million second-class respirators, we ordered 250,000 suits, we ordered 250,000 goggles. We ordered 250,000 protective shields, we ordered several hundred thousand disposable testers, and all of that is paid for and is in China.\nSECTION F: Zuzana TVARŮŽKOVÁ: As Minister of the Interior, how do you assess the selection of the future head of the General Inspectorate of Security Forces? If it is Radim Dragoun. Jan HAMÁČEK: Then it is not my competence, it is the competence of the Prime Minister. I assume that there were 14 applicants for the position, some kind of selection procedure took place here. Mr. Dragoun, who was therefore selected by the Prime Minister, is still awaiting a hearing in the relevant committee of the Chamber of Deputies and then, after that, an appointment.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
