    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: And now we have introduced another specific support that will go to those operators, either owners or whatever we call them, who will receive a certain payment, which we will calculate based on the number of employees. So if someone has, for example, 5 employees, they will receive 400 CZK per person per day.\nSECTION B: If you look, in Slovakia it cost, I mean Mochovce, three, four, which is approximately 1000 MW of power, it cost 6 billion euros. Yes, someone still claims, but you already had a base there in the order of one to two billion, so let&#39;s admit that it was 7 billion. That means, then it&#39;s around the amount of 100, 150, 160, 180 billion. It depends on the exchange rate used to convert it.\nSECTION C: We have been warning for several months and we also had security information that this (the operator entry auction, note: Demagog.cz) can only benefit one interested party, that there will be no foreign entity and that therefore what was expected from it will not happen, and that this is a really good competitive environment that will lead to a reduction in the prices of data services and the preparation of the environment for 5G.\nSECTION D: HAVLÍČEK: (...) and then we have NÚKIB, an independent institution. TAKÁČ, moderator: Who stated what he stated that it is a security risk (Huawei, note: Demagog.cz). HAVLÍČEK: Yes, he stated it at the end of last year. At the moment, if I have the correct information, an audit of all devices is actually underway at the state level.\nSECTION E: It is necessary to respect the opinion of the European Commission, which made a fundamental comment, namely the so-called network sharing. It stated that as it is in the Czech Republic, it is definitely not in the regime of a normal competitive environment, literally and literally stating that it eliminates further investments in innovation and thus eliminates consumer comfort. \n\nSECTION F: The Czech Telecommunications Office also acknowledged this (doubts about the auction for the operator&#39;s entry, note: Demagog.cz). There were people from the CTU Council, such as Chairman Novák, who said, it&#39;s absolutely perfect, I support it; and there were other members of the Council who said, I absolutely disagree with it; and they leaned towards the solution suggested by the Ministry of Industry and Trade or other operators. \n\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
