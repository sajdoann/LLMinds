<p>To evaluate this statement, we will use only a quote from the Constitution of the Czech Republic. Specifically, <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl68">Article 68</a> , which states:</p><p> <i>“(1) The Government is responsible to the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> <i>(2) The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President of the Republic and, upon his proposal, shall appoint the other members of the Government and entrust them with the management of ministries or other offices.</i></p><p> <i>(3) The Government shall appear before the Chamber of Deputies within thirty days of its appointment and request a vote of confidence.</i></p><p> <i>(4) If the newly appointed government does not gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the procedure shall be as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. If the government thus appointed also fails to gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Republic shall appoint the Prime Minister on the proposal of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> It is precisely the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned article in the Constitution that describes that in the event of a vote of no confidence being cast on the first attempt, the same procedure is followed again. However, if a vote of no confidence is cast on the second attempt, a third attempt follows, during which the power to select the Prime Minister lies with the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> Let us add that this constitutional procedure gives the President of the Republic considerable room for discretion. In particular, the Constitution does not dictate to the President who should be appointed Prime Minister in each attempt to form a government. As a rule, this is the chairman of the party that won the election, but as Miloš Zeman mentions in a verified interview, the coalition potential of individual parliamentary parties also plays a role. Let us recall the parliamentary elections in 2010, when the ČSSD won, but President Klaus instead of Bohuslav Sobotka <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sanci-vyjednat-vladu-ma-necas-sobotku-klaus-zklamal/r~i:article:670008/">entrusted</a> the formation of the government to the chairman of <a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2010/ps2?xjazyk=CZ">the second</a> ODS, Petr Nečas, whom he subsequently <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/klaus-jmenoval-necase-premierem-45608">appointed</a> Prime Minister.</p><p> A similar case occurred in 2013 after the fall of the Nečas government, when the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Miroslava Němcová had 101 parliamentary signatures in support of a possible new government, but President Zeman instead <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1090181-vladu-sestavi-ekonom-rusnok-rozhodl-zeman">tasked</a> Jiří Rusnok with forming a caretaker government and subsequently <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/-vladu-odborniku-povede-rusnok-prezident-zeman-ho-jmenoval-premierem_201306251920_mskalicky">appointed</a> him prime minister.</p><p> Even in the second attempt to appoint a prime minister who will form a government with confidence, there is no stipulation as to who should be appointed, especially that it should be the “second in line.” In 2018, for example, President Zeman <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/premier-andrej-babis-prezident-milos-zeman-podruhe_1806061400_ako">appointed</a> Andrej Babiš as prime minister even after his government failed to win confidence in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
