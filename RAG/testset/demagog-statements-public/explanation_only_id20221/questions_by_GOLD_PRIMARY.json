    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: That was in the draft resolution - that point was not discussed for technical reasons, it was postponed to the next meeting of the security committee - but the resolution asked whether there was any methodology and whether there should not be, and whether there should not be a binding methodology for all members of the government, specifically for the use, the secure use of email accounts, the government&#39;s own.\nSECTION B: After all, in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions, Jan Hamáček also expressed that at least that part of the resolution that I proposed and where we say that the legionnaires as such are simply those who have contributed to our state, and that should not be questioned and the Chamber of Deputies supports that, so he is ready to support that part of the resolution.\nSECTION C: Lucie VOPÁLENSKÁ, moderator (…) if there were to be any significant disputes between STAN and the Pirates, how would you resolve them? Vít RAKUŠAN, chairman of the STAN movement It is defined in the coalition agreement, where such disputes are simply resolved by the coalition council, which is a representative body that is actually above the decisions of the party bodies in certain competences.\nSECTION D: I am originally a history teacher and I perceive the role of the Vlasovites as very contradictory. I realize that at the end of the war they certainly helped Prague, for example, but overall we cannot see their role as entirely positive, although history always has many interpretations. They are people who opposed Stalin, but at the same time they are people who fought on the side of the Germans.\nSECTION E: (...) the preparatory steps, even according to the recommendations of this team (Pavel Řehák, note: Demagog.cz), were supposed to be carried out in those summer months. And they were not. In those summer months, the Central Epidemiological Commission did not even meet, which, by the way, is exactly recommended here, how it should work, how to prepare pandemic plans.\nSECTION F: If you look at the vote of the security committee that evaluated the information from the Security Information Service, even the parties that usually don&#39;t applaud the BIS, whether it&#39;s the SPD or the Communists, they all voted for the resolution where we defined the threat as serious. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
