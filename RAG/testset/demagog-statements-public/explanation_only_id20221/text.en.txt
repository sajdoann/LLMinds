<p>The Pirates and the STAN movement <a href="https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/Pirati-a-STAN-predstavili-navrh-koalicni-smlouvy.html">presented</a> the coalition <a href="https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/fmfile/0/files/2020%20hlavn%C3%AD%20STAN/koalicni-smlouva-pirati-a-starostove.pdf">agreement</a> (.pdf) on December 22, 2020 and submitted it to their members for a vote. The STAN national committee <a href="https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/info-a-media/tiskove-zpravy/celostatni-vybor-hnuti-stan-schvalil-koalicni-smlouvu-s-piraty">approved</a> the agreement on January 7, and the Pirates approved it at their national online forum <a href="https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/79-procent-piratu-odsouhlasila-koalici-se-stan.html">on January 12,</a> 2021.</p><p> The coalition <a href="https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/fmfile/0/files/2020%20hlavn%C3%AD%20STAN/koalicni-smlouva-pirati-a-starostove.pdf">agreement</a> (.pdf, Appendix No. 2, page 2) states regarding the coalition council:</p><p> <i>&quot;2.1. The highest body of the coalition is <strong>the coalition council</strong> , which meets in the format of 2 to 5 members in equal numbers for each coalition party (…).&quot;</i></p><p> The scope of the coalition council&#39;s activities is then listed in point 2.3. (ibid., pp. 2–3).<i> </i>For example, the council will approve the coalition&#39;s program, be responsible for fulfilling legal obligations (p. 6), create a joint post-election negotiation team (p. 7), or approve rules regarding the management of joint property (ibid., Appendix No. 4, p. 3).</p><p> As for disputes, point no. 12 (ibid., Appendix no. 2, p. 8) regarding their resolution states as follows:</p><p> <i>&quot;12.1. If a dispute arises between the parties to this contract regarding the performance, interpretation or alleged breach of this contract or its threat, the parties undertake to resolve it amicably, by personal negotiations between the interested parties or by negotiations with a mediator whom both parties trust, or by referral to a higher level within the coalition, or to the national leaders of the coalition parties, and to make all necessary efforts to reach an agreement and resolve the matter amicably.&quot;</i></p><p> <i>&quot;12.2. If the dispute cannot be resolved by agreement or negotiation, either party has the right to initiate conciliation proceedings, based on a written proposal to <strong>the coalition council. Three representatives of each contracting party participate in the conciliation proceedings</strong> .&quot;</i></p><p> Disputes between the parties of the coalition are therefore resolved in various ways. However, it is true that significant disputes can be resolved by the coalition council as the highest body. At the same time, it is true that, for example, in the area of programs or post-election negotiations, the coalition council is the key decision-making body, which is thus superior to party bodies.</p>
