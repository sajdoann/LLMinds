<p>At a press conference after the meeting of the Government Council for Health Risks on August 17, 2020, the then Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-po-zasedani-rady-vlady-pro-zdravotni-rizika--17--srpna-2020-183179/">stated</a> that from September 1, the obligation to wear masks in public transport and in closed public spaces (with the exception of restaurants and, in the case of schools, in classrooms) would be reintroduced.</p><p> At the same conference, Minister of Education Robert Plaga <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-po-zasedani-rady-vlady-pro-zdravotni-rizika--17--srpna-2020-183179/">announced</a> that a joint Manual of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education ( <a href="https://www.msmt.cz/file/53580_1_1/">.pdf</a> ) was presented at the Council meeting, which concerns the operation of schools and school facilities in the 2020/2021 school year in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. This manual was subsequently intended for schools. It should be added that the document also contained references (.pdf, p. 5) to the so-called <a href="https://www.mzcr.cz/tiskove-centrum-mz/system-pohotovostnich-stupnu-nabidne-obcanum-predvidatelny-plan-protiepidemickych-opatreni-v-souvislosti-s-covid-19/">traffic light</a> measures in individual districts, according to which schools were to follow.</p><p> On August 19, 2020, the Minister of Health Vojtěch and the Chief Hygienist Jarmila Rážová <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/rousky-budou-povinne-v-kadernictvich-i-u-voleb-zive/1923208">spoke</a> at a press conference in the Chamber of Deputies regarding <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/skoly-skolstvi-zaci-rousky-koronavirus-opatreni-adam-vojtech.A200820_184410_domaci_wass">the published</a> emergency measure ( <a href="https://www.cak.cz/assets/mimoradne-opatreni-noseni-ochrannych-prostredku-dychacich-cest-s-vyjimkami-s-ucinnosti-od-1-9-2020-do-odvolani.pdf">.pdf</a> ) on the mandatory wearing of masks indoors, on public transport and in schools.</p><p> The government&#39;s actions regarding masks at the time were criticized by the head of the ODS, Petr Fiala. <i>&quot;3 weeks ago, Minister Vojtěch solemnly introduced a &#39;traffic light&#39; according to which the state would introduce new measures. Today, when the traffic light is white almost throughout the country, masks are being introduced again across the board, including restaurants and hairdressers. Doesn&#39;t that make sense to you? It doesn&#39;t matter. Nobody cares,&quot;</i> <a href="https://twitter.com/P_Fiala/status/1296088775873921027">he wrote</a> on Twitter.</p><p> On August 20, the Minister of Health and epidemiologists met with Prime Minister Babiš. <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/v-narizenich-o-rouskach-je-chaos-babis-se-sejde-s-vojtechem-40333880">The topic of</a> the meeting was the chaotic regulations on the wearing of masks, which Andrej Babiš had reservations about. After this meeting, Prime Minister Babiš later identified epidemiologist <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/premier-andrej-babis-rousky-koronavirus-vojtech-jermanova.A200821_200443_domaci_aug">Rastislav Maďar</a> as the one who promoted the strict rules on the wearing of masks. Babiš repeatedly <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koronavirus-babis-vojtech-rousky-opatreni-belorusko_2008212149_onz">claimed</a> in media interviews that Vojtěch did not have good information, because each working group had a different opinion on the wearing of masks.</p><p> <i>&quot;Associate Professor Maďar wanted the area-wide measures to be implemented regardless of the traffic light. But we wanted the measures to be controlled by the traffic light and other data from the smart quarantine, because otherwise the traffic light is pointless,&quot;</i> <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/madar-dostal-pres-prsty-za-rouskovy-zmatek-bude-degradovan-116899">said</a> Petr Šnajdárek, the architect of the smart quarantine, to Seznam Zprávám on August 20, who also attended the aforementioned meeting.</p><p> Some members of his team and other working groups also <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/madar-dostal-pres-prsty-za-rouskovy-zmatek-bude-degradovan-116899">disagreed</a> with the form of the measures that Rastislav Maďar advocated and that were to come into effect on September 1. <i>&quot;A number of opinions were expressed at the meeting of our group that we do not agree with it being</i> <i>announced in this wording on Wednesday (August 19, note: Demagog.cz). I did not want masks to be mandatory in schools,&quot;</i> <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/madar-dostal-pres-prsty-za-rouskovy-zmatek-bude-degradovan-116899">said,</a> for example, epidemiologist and member of Maďar&#39;s team Roman Chlíbek.</p><p> Immediately after, <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-ministra-zdravotnictvi-k-mimoradnym-opatrenim--20--srpna-2020-183212/">a relaxation of</a> the planned measures was announced at a press conference on August 20. According to the new rules, people were only supposed to wear them when there was a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in the region. <i>“We are actually able to react very promptly if there were any changes in the situation. (…) So we came to a certain conclusion regarding the modification of the extraordinary measure, but not its cancellation, rather better targeting where we currently perceive the greatest risk in terms of the spread of the disease,”</i> Adam Vojtěch explained at the time, justifying the change in decision.</p><p> On August 21, the Seznam Zprávy portal reported that Minister Vojtěch <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/mlcte-a-me-vynechte-po-rouskovem-debaklu-meni-vojtech-boj-s-covidem-116946">had moved</a> all three working <a href="https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/pracovni-a-poradni-skupiny/">groups</a> dealing with the Covid-19 epidemic, i.e. the laboratory, clinical and epidemiological groups, to the so-called Integrated Central Management Team ( <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/ppov/rada_vlady_pro_zdravotni_rizika/integrovany_centralni_ridici_tym/uvodni-text-integrovany-centralni-ridici-tym-183148/">ICŘT</a> ) of smart quarantine.
