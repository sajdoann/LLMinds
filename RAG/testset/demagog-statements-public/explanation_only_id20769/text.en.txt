<p>The entire <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-prvni-audit-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_2104232054_tzr">process</a> investigating Andrej Babiš&#39;s potential conflict of interest has been ongoing since 2018, when Transparency International <a href="https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-podava-prvni-podnet-tykajici-se-stretu-zajmu-andreje-babise/">pointed out</a> the potential conflict of interest and also filed <a href="https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-podava-druhy-podnet-tykajici-se-stretu-zajmu-andreje-babise-a-evropskych-dotaci-pro-agrofert/">a complaint</a> with the European Commission. The first preliminary audit report arrived in the Czech Republic in <a href="https://euractiv.cz/section/cr-v-evropske-unii/news/cesky-cerven-v-eu-traskave-audity-evropske-komise/">June</a> 2019.</p><p> The audit investigation that preceded the report also <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropske-dotace-babis-agrofert-stret-zajmu-audit-kontroly-eu_1901111806_jgr">affected</a> , among other things, the Ministry for Regional Development (MMR), or rather the National Coordination Body (NOK), whose <a href="https://kormoran.vlada.cz/usneseni/usneseni_webtest.nsf/web_file/uv130612.0448.doc/$File/uv130612.0448.doc">role</a> (.doc, p. 1) <a href="https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/fondy-eu/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci">is performed</a> by the MMR. At that time, officials were already in charge of the Czech side&#39;s response, so the minister should not have had any influence on it, at least not directly. However, she herself <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/ministerstvo-pro-mistni-rozvoj-audit-evropska-komise-stret-zajmu-premier-andrej-babis.A190827_142058_domaci_rko">stated</a> : <i>&quot;Now we contradict every sentence on every page. We feel very hurt because a lot of things are not true.&quot;</i> We were unable to find in publicly available sources that Minister Dostálová met with EU auditors during the audit or at any time later, or that she was in direct contact with them regarding the report on Andrej Babiš&#39;s conflict of interest.</p><p> In the case of the response to the second audit report, which was delivered to the Czech Republic in <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-prvni-audit-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_2104232054_tzr">December 2019</a> and was supposed to contain the final conclusions of the review and also mentioned a conflict of interest, it took longer to write the response. Minister Dostálová herself <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ministerstvo-poslalo-do-bruselu-odpoved-na-audit-k-babisove-stretu-zajmu-40325921">stated</a> at the time that responses to audit reports are processed by officials. More precisely, she named officials of the National Coordination Body and also their <i>&quot;colleagues from the affected departments&quot;</i> . <i>&nbsp;</i> As we can learn from information on <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-stret-zajmu-praha-audit-evropska-komise-agrofert-dotace_1912051210_kno">the iROZHLAS</a> server, this was mainly the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, whose competences include drawing subsidies from the aforementioned structural funds and the Cohesion Fund.</p><p> The Minister for Regional Development, especially shortly after the arrival of this second audit report, <a href="https://livestream.com/accounts/17590784/events/8915480/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=false&amp;defaultDrawer=&amp;autoPlay=false&amp;mute=false">emphasized</a> (video, 0:48) that the documents are so-called <i>confidential</i> , i.e. in a confidential regime, and that <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/dostalova-komentuje-vysledky-auditu-k-babisovu-stretu-zajmu-40305726">not</a> even ministers have access to them and that it is purely a matter for officials. She allegedly <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/dostalova-komentuje-vysledky-auditu-k-babisovu-stretu-zajmu-40305726">did not read</a> the report herself and <i>is not &quot;interested&quot;</i> in it. However, she had also previously <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/klara-dostalova-evropska-komise-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_1912031101_miz">added</a> : <i>&quot;We will definitely want to talk about some things face to face.&quot;</i></p><p> The only document currently published is the final audit <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cz_functioning_report/cz_functioning_report_en.pdf">report</a> (.pdf) of the European Commission. For example, the report states that other entities audited (.pdf, pp. 1–2) are the Ministries of the Environment, Industry and Trade, and Labour and Social Affairs. In addition to the aforementioned ministries, agencies and funds were also <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/20770">audited</a> , such as the Agency for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic, the Agency for the Promotion and Entrepreneurship and Investment CzechInvest, the ESI Funds Council, the Common Strategic Framework Funds Council, the National Coordination Body, the Steering and Control Committee, and the City of Prague.</p><p> In response to this final report, the Minister <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/dostalova-andrej-babis-agrofert-audit-soud-eu-evropska-komise_2104262032_ban">stated</a> that the Czech authorities <i>“hold the legal opinion, based on the arguments sent to the European Commission, that there was no breach of regulations”</i> . She also insisted on the existence of two legal interpretations, between which only a court can decide. The Ministry for Regional Development <a href="https://mmr.cz/cs/ostatni/web/novinky/vyjadreni-mmr-k-auditu-evropske-komise">states</a> in its press release that the Czech authorities in their responses to the European Commission <i>“have repeatedly stated that the management and control systems have been set up in the Czech Republic in accordance with EU and national rules governing the issue of conflict of interest and that the Czech Republic maintains this position”</i> .</p><p> In conclusion, let us summarize that we were unable to find in publicly available sources whether Klára Dostálová interfered with the officials of the National Coordination Body in formulating their responses to the European Commission, or to what extent this was done. For this reason, we assess the statement as unverifiable.</p>
