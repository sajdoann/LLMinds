    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: This partial amendment was really only intended to speed up procedures and remove the administrative burden in the so-called negotiated procedure without publication, which is really only for two reasons, that is, we did not change anything in the law, only the negotiated procedure without publication due to extremely urgent circumstances, or if there is only one supplier.\nSECTION B: What we disagree on is that the Ministry of the Interior actually calculated it as if we were building all the offices on a green field, as if there were no construction procedures here. So of course it calculated the new offices for civil servants at 30 billion crowns. Nothing like that will happen and I am sorry that the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior does not state that the state currently pays municipalities for the civil servants who handle construction procedures, for the rental of those rooms, for overheads, and so on. It is not a small amount. The state pays municipalities 4 billion a year. And of that, 360 million is roughly for overheads and rent.\nSECTION C: I was not in contact with the auditors at all and I did not participate in any way in the responses to the European Commission. (...) I was not the one who stated, in response to the auditors&#39; criticisms, that in the case of a possible conflict of interest of Prime Minister Babiš, there was no violation of Czech or European laws. (...) I did not decide on the response to the European Commission. Our ministry only sent it because it has the role of the national authority for coordinating finances from EU funds.\nSECTION D: Tomáš PANCÍŘ, moderator: In the end, your parliamentary group, the parliamentary group of the ANO movement, agreed to postpone the discussion (of the amendments to the Public Procurement Act, note: Demagog.cz) until the regular meeting. Why did you, as ANO, withdraw? (…) Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: (…) Other amendments and suggestions began to be made (…)\nSECTION E: Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: (Andrej Babiš, ed. Dermagog.cz) has fulfilled everything that Czech law requires of him. And Czech officials also claim this. Radek BARTONÍČEK: Officials from your Ministry for Regional Development. Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: No. They were officials from seven ministries who were preparing the answer. (...) Officials were also from ministries that ANO does not have, or they were from the Prague operational program, where Pirát is the mayor.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
