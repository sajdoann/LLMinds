<p>In connection with formulating the response to the European Commission&#39;s preliminary audit, which announced the existence of a conflict of interest of Prime Minister Babiš, as well as its final version from December <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-prvni-audit-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_2104232054_tzr">2019</a> , Minister <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ministerstvo-poslalo-do-bruselu-odpoved-na-audit-k-babisove-stretu-zajmu-40325921">Dostálová</a> always spoke about the document being processed by officials. Specifically, she mentions officials of the National Coordination Body (NOK), whose <a href="https://kormoran.vlada.cz/usneseni/usneseni_webtest.nsf/web_file/uv130612.0448.doc/$File/uv130612.0448.doc">function</a> (.doc, p. 1) <a href="https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/fondy-eu/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci">is performed</a> by the Ministry of Regional Development, and their &quot; <i>colleagues from the affected departments&quot;.</i></p><p> In this regard, <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-stret-zajmu-praha-audit-evropska-komise-agrofert-dotace_1912051210_kno">the iRozhlas</a> server mentions part of the preliminary audit report from June 2019, which states that this concerns &quot; <i>the drawing of subsidies from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. This is money that is redistributed primarily by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.&quot;</i></p><p> However, in the final version of the audit report <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cz_functioning_report/cz_functioning_report_en.pdf">published by</a> the European Commission (.pdf, pp. 1–2) in April this year, we can also read a list of institutions &quot; <i>involved in the process of managing and distributing subsidies&quot;</i> that were the subject of the audit, and which are therefore the above-mentioned &quot; <i>affected departments&quot;</i> . It is these institutions that communicated with the European Commission.</p><p> In addition to the supra-ministerial <a href="https://www.dotacni.info/tag/spolecny-strategicky-ramec/">Council</a> for the Common Strategic Framework Funds, <a href="https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/evropske-fondy-v-cr/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci/pracovni-skupiny/rada-pro-fondy-ssr">the Council</a> for the ESI Funds and the Steering and Coordination <a href="https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/evropske-fondy-v-cr/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci/koordinace/ridici-a-koordinacni-vybor">Committee,</a> there is the already mentioned National Coordination Body. Three ministries are also listed here: the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of the Environment. In addition to them, the report also lists the Agency for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic, the Agency for Entrepreneurship and Investment Support CzechInvest and the capital city of Prague.</p><p> In total, the audit report <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cz_functioning_report/cz_functioning_report_en.pdf">lists</a> (.pdf, pp. 1–2) 7 &quot; <i>managing and intermediary institutions&quot;</i> , which include the ministries and agencies just mentioned, and 4 &quot; <i>horizontal institutions&quot;</i> , which include the National Coordination Body and other supra-departmental institutions.</p><p> Minister Dostálová is also right that these are not only ministries led by ministers from the ANO movement. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is led by <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/ministryne">Jana Maláčová</a> from the ČSSD, and the Mayor of Prague is <a href="https://www.praha.eu/jnp/cz/o_meste/primator_a_volene_organy/Primator/vizitka_primatora_hmp/index.html">Zdeněk Hřib</a> from the Pirate Party.</p><p><br></p>
