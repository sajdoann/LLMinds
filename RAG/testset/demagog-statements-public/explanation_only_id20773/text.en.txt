<p>Minister Dostálová made the statement as part of her assessment of the generality of European Union rules in relation to Andrej Babiš&#39;s conflict of interest. She stated verbatim: <i>&quot;Prime Minister Babiš is proceeding strictly according to the law. He put his assets into trust funds, he did everything according to the law. The problem is that the European Union regulations are formulated in very general terms. (…)</i> <i>It&#39;s terribly vague, really. It&#39;s really terribly general. Everything can fit under that.&quot;</i> The entire assessment of generality by the minister must therefore be seen in the context of the applicability of the civil law institute of trust funds to avoid conflicts of interest.</p><p> Whether a legal regulation is &quot;general&quot; (abstract or concrete in legal theory) is, of course, a largely subjective judgment that we do not assess. We only assess whether the formulation used by the Minister is part of European Union law.</p><p> The statement itself is an almost verbatim quote from the provisions of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R1046&amp;from=cs">Regulation</a> (EC) No 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (.pdf, p. 57, Article 61). Article 61, paragraph (1), literally states that:</p><p> <i>&quot;Participants in financial operations within the meaning of Chapter 4 of this Title and other persons, including national authorities at all levels, involved in the implementation of the budget under direct, indirect and shared management, including in the preparation for such action, in audit or control, shall refrain from any action which may bring their interests into conflict with those of the Union. They shall also take appropriate measures to prevent, in the functions within their responsibility, any conflict of interest and to address situations which may objectively be perceived as a conflict of interest.&quot;</i></p><p> However, the conflict of interest under paragraph (1) is further slightly specified in paragraph (3) of the same article, which states that: <i>“(…) a conflict of interest occurs if, for family reasons, for emotional ties, for political or national affinity, for economic interest or for other direct or indirect personal interest, the impartial and objective performance of the functions of a participant in financial operations or another person under paragraph 1 is threatened.”</i></p><p> However, European legislation does not specify whether it is possible to &quot;avoid&quot; conflicts of interest using the institution of trust funds (i.e. whether trust funds can be considered &quot;appropriate measures&quot; within the meaning of the article cited above).</p><p> We have already described the legal basis of the entire European Commission audit and other regulations in our other <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/20704">justification</a> .</p>
