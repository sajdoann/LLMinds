    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: This partial amendment was really only intended to speed up procedures and remove the administrative burden in the so-called negotiated procedure without publication, which is really only for two reasons, that is, we did not change anything in the law, only the negotiated procedure without publication due to extremely urgent circumstances, or if there is only one supplier.\nSECTION B: They state (in the European rules on conflict of interest, note: Demagog.cz) that &quot;participants in financial operations, including national authorities at all levels, involved in the implementation of the budget, shall refrain from any action that could bring their interests into conflict with those of the EU, and shall at the same time take measures to prevent the emergence of a conflict of interest in the functions within their responsibilities.&quot;\nSECTION C: I was not in contact with the auditors at all and I did not participate in any way in the responses to the European Commission. (...) I was not the one who stated, in response to the auditors&#39; criticisms, that in the case of a possible conflict of interest of Prime Minister Babiš, there was no violation of Czech or European laws. (...) I did not decide on the response to the European Commission. Our ministry only sent it because it has the role of the national authority for coordinating finances from EU funds.\nSECTION D: Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: (Andrej Babiš, ed. Dermagog.cz) has fulfilled everything that Czech law requires of him. And Czech officials also claim this. Radek BARTONÍČEK: Officials from your Ministry for Regional Development. Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: No. They were officials from seven ministries who were preparing the answer. (...) Officials were also from ministries that ANO does not have, or they were from the Prague operational program, where Pirát is the mayor.\nSECTION E: And I just want to remind you that the Czech Republic was &quot;scammed&quot; in Brussels by the then Deputy Minister of Finance Lukáš Wagenknecht, without the subsequent investigation finding anything illegal. So the monitoring system was investigated by the police, the Office for the Protection of Competition and the European Commission. And the latter finally told us that under pressure it would return the funding for European projects.\nSECTION F: Tomáš PANCÍŘ, moderator: In the end, your parliamentary group, the parliamentary group of the ANO movement, agreed to postpone the discussion (of the amendments to the Public Procurement Act, note: Demagog.cz) until the regular meeting. Why did you, as ANO, withdraw? (…) Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: (…) Other amendments and suggestions began to be made (…)\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
