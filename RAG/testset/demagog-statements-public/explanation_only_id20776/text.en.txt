<p>The audit, which <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1513060-policiste-hledaji-na-mmr-podklady-k-elektronickemu-systemu">was carried out</a> at the Ministry of Regional Development in connection with the monitoring system of European funds, was carried out at the request of the European Commission. The audit was carried out by a team from the Ministry of Finance, which actually <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1608335-brusel-dal-cesku-stopku-na-dotace-na-projekty-za-568-milionu-korun">revealed</a> irregularities in the contract.</p><p> At the time the Ministry of Finance provided the European Commission with the aforementioned audit report, it <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/o-ministerstvu/zakladni-informace/historie-ministerstva/ministri-v-historii">was headed by</a> Andrej Babiš. At the time, Lukáš Wagenknecht <a href="https://www.e15.cz/domaci/babis-vymenil-prvni-namestky-na-ministerstvo-miri-wagenknecht-a-hornochova-1058079">held</a> the position of First Deputy Minister of Finance and was in charge of the audit at the Ministry for Regional Development. Since the Ministry of Finance had officially requested the preparation of the audit by the European Commission, and Minister Babiš thus had information about the audit itself, the accusation against Lukáš Wagenknecht is quite problematic.</p><p> The then Minister for Regional Development, Karla Šlechtová, questioned the audit conclusions, however, Lukáš Wagenknecht <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1520944-cesko-nemuze-zahajit-cerpani-penez-z-eu">stated</a> that the audit was carried out in accordance with the law, international audit standards and European Commission guidelines.</p><p> Based on an audit report prepared by the Ministry of Finance, the European Commission <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2695622-policie-odlozila-vysetrovani-zakazky-ministerstva-na-monitorovani-evropskych-dotaci">announced</a> <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1608335-brusel-dal-cesku-stopku-na-dotace-na-projekty-za-568-milionu-korun">on October 14,</a> 2015 that it had suspended the reimbursement of some projects until the police investigation was completed. At the same time, it also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1533184-ek-potvrdila-ze-tendr-na-monitorovaci-system-provazely-chyby">postponed</a> the decision on the amount that it would not reimburse to the Czech Republic. However, the government immediately <a href="https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/VPRA9W3AAB5O">decided</a> (.pdf) to reimburse the monitoring system from the state budget. As a result, the state <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2695622-policie-odlozila-vysetrovani-zakazky-ministerstva-na-monitorovani-evropskych-dotaci">lost</a> approximately 820 million crowns.</p><p> The police <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2695622-policie-odlozila-vysetrovani-zakazky-ministerstva-na-monitorovani-evropskych-dotaci">dropped</a> the investigation into the contract for the monitoring system for European subsidies in early 2019, stating that no crime had occurred. The Commission was <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/zakazka-monitorovaci-system-evropske-dotace-lidove-noviny-vysetrovani-eu_1901030624_dp">made aware</a> of this and consequently <a href="https://www.lidovky.cz/domov/kartel-ktery-nebyl-stal-cesko-miliardu.A190103_104114_ln_domov_ele">applied</a> a 25% correction for errors that occurred in the award of the contract.</p><p> In addition to the Czech Police and the European Commission, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2695622-policie-odlozila-vysetrovani-zakazky-ministerstva-na-monitorovani-evropskych-dotaci">investigated</a> the IT contract at the Ministry for Regional Development. At the end of 2015, the Antimonopoly Office <a href="https://neovlivni.cz/uohs-udelil-pokuty-mmr-za-it-zakazku-monitorovaci-system/">imposed</a> a fine of 100,000 crowns on the ministry for errors in the contract, but also <a href="https://mmr.cz/cs/pro-media/mmr-v-mediich/2016/2-0-pro-slechtovou-zastaly-se-ji-2-urady">decided</a> that it did not find evidence of a cartel agreement. The fine was subsequently reduced to 50,000 crowns.</p><p> Minister Dostálová is therefore right that the case of the contract for the monitoring system of European funds was examined by the Police of the Czech Republic, the Antimonopoly Office and the European Commission. The Police&#39;s conclusions show that no crime was committed. However, it is not true that Lukáš Wagenknecht &quot; <i>scammed</i> &quot; the Czech Republic in Brussels. The European Commission requested the audit, with the knowledge of today&#39;s Prime Minister Babiš.</p>
