<p>According to <a href="https://denikn.cz/130092/neruseni-kvot-diktat-uredniku-i-hlasovani-europoslancu-prosli-jsme-babisovo-predvolebni-cau-lidi/">verification by Deník N</a> , the so-called migration quotas, i.e. the system <a href="https://euractiv.cz/section/vnitro-a-spravedlnost/opinion/ohlednuti-zpet-proc-cr-v-roce-2015-odmitla-uprchlicke-kvoty-a-stalo-to-za-to/">of redistribution</a> of asylum seekers, were approved in September 2015 at <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/jha/2015/09/22/?fbclid=IwAR3p8V8_AckMRtiZDWWoblSFoYw064jgsBHTZ1u0_Id4wLMQIrMnMJlmyn0">a meeting</a> of the Council of Ministers. The Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians and Romanians <a href="https://denikn.cz/130092/neruseni-kvot-diktat-uredniku-i-hlasovani-europoslancu-prosli-jsme-babisovo-predvolebni-cau-lidi/">spoke out</a> against the proposal. The Finns abstained. On behalf of the Czech Republic, the former Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) rejected the introduction of quotas. According to current EU rules, the proposal was accepted because the consent of all <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/IP_15_5596">member states</a> was not required, but only a qualified majority.</p><p> <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1601&amp;from=EN&amp;fbclid=IwAR2mO6h45kRLy7MRHjUZ6Dnrd0i6ZO_6-ZrdUwVnjbIP8dYdqawelyMmogw">Council Decision 2015/1601</a> of 22 September 2015, which introduced the quotas, states in Article 13 that the decision <i>“shall apply until 26 September 2017”</i> and was therefore temporary. In <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/21600/19-euco-final-conclusions-cs.pdf">October 2017</a> (.pdf), the EU heads of government, at the European Council meeting, where the Czech Republic was represented by the then Prime Minister <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/ocekavane-udalosti/premier-sobotka-bude-jednat-v-ramci-v4-s-predsedou-evropske-komise-junckerem--nasledne-se-zucastni-evropske-rady-160703/">Bohuslav Sobotka</a> , called for the use of voluntary resettlement programmes ( <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/21600/19-euco-final-conclusions-cs.pdf">.pdf</a> , p. 2). The refugee quotas were therefore no longer to be mandatory. <i>“The mandatory quotas were thus de facto abolished before Babiš took office as Prime Minister,”</i> <a href="https://denikn.cz/130092/neruseni-kvot-diktat-uredniku-i-hlasovani-europoslancu-prosli-jsme-babisovo-predvolebni-cau-lidi/">Deník N</a> reports.</p><p> At the aforementioned summit in <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/evropsky-parlament/tusk-zeme-eu-zajisti-fondu-pro-afriku-penize-k-reseni-migrac/r~09df7dd6b4fc11e7ad190025900fea04/">October 2017,</a> EU countries also agreed that new refugee quotas could only be adopted <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/zahranicni/migrace-povinni-kvoty-prerozdelovani-cesko-summit-eu.A171021_359426_zahranicni_aha">unanimously</a> .

It rejected mandatory quotas, saying that it did not consider them a solution. However, it appealed <i>for “European solidarity with overburdened states and for a common European approach.”</i></p>
