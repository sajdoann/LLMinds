<p>The European refugee crisis, as the wave of migration to Europe in 2015 and 2016 was called, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/czech-republic/news/migrace/migrace_historicky_prehled_cs">began</a> in the spring of 2015 and was caused by the escalation of the <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3283818-krvavy-konflikt-v-syrii-vypukl-pred-deseti-lety-u-moci-zustava-oslabeny-basar-asad">war</a> in Syria. </p><figure class="embed"><iframe style="border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/48Cio/1/" id="datawrapper-chart-48Cio" aria-label="Interactive line chart" title="Number of asylum applications to EU countries"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></figure><p> A dispute arose in the European Union over the redistribution of refugees heading to Europe who had already arrived in Greece and Italy. Many countries <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/povinne-kvoty-pro-prijimani-uprchliku-odmita-rada-zemi-eu-tvrdi-cesko_201505191154_akottova">had</a> reservations about mandatory quotas. However, the loudest opposition <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti">came</a> from <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/mezinarodni-organizace-a-vs-visegradska-ctyrka.aspx">the Visegrad Four</a> . The quotas <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti">were</a> approved by EU interior ministers in September 2015. In December of the same year, Slovakia and Hungary <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti">filed</a> a lawsuit with the Court of Justice of the EU against the redistribution of asylum seekers based on quotas. In June 2017, for example, the Czech government <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vlada-cesko-uz-neprijme-zadneho-migranta-na-zaklade-kvot-zhorsila-se_1706051706_pj">decided</a> that it would no longer accept any asylum seekers based on quotas, <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti">accepting</a> 12 of the 2,600 people allocated.</p><p> The European Commission then decided to open infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In September 2017, the relocation programme for applicants from Greece and Italy <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti">ended</a> , with 29,144 people out of 160,000 being relocated and only five countries fulfilling their quotas. In April 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti">had failed to fulfil</a> their obligations under European Union law.</p><p> On the contrary, in 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3173733-od-vety-zvladneme-uplynulo-pet-let-rozhodla-bych-se-stejne-tvrdi-merkelova">took a</a> welcoming stance towards accepting refugees with her famous media statement &quot;we will <i>manage it</i> &quot;. At that time, Germany <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/migr_asyappctza/default/table?lang=en">was</a> also the country with the highest number of asylum applications. However, Armin Laschet, the CDU candidate for chancellor in the September German elections, has now expressed the opposite. After the capture of Kabul, <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fluechtlinge-afghanistan-121.html">he stated</a> that Germany &quot; <i>must not give the impression that we can accept every person in need</i> &quot;.</p><p> French President Emmanuel Macron <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/evropsky-parlament/v-evrope-rostou-nove-ploty-unie-se-boji-uprchlicke-vlny-z-af/r~a5d8490204d511ec966d0cc47ab5f122/">spoke</a> about the need to &quot; <i>defend against illegal migration</i> &quot; after the fall of Kabul. His predecessor, Fran√ßois Hollande, chose a different rhetoric in 2015, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-france/hollande-opens-french-doors-to-refugees-despite-opposition-idUKKCN0R70WC20150907">saying he</a> would &quot; <i>get the crisis under control</i> &quot; and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/french-president-francois-hollande-welcomes-refugees-paris-attack/story?id=35274658">defending</a> his decision to uphold his refugee admission commitments despite the terrorist attacks in Paris.</p><p> Six EU member states, including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/six-countries-urge-eu-not-stop-deportations-afghanistan-belgium-says-2021-08-10/">sent</a> a letter to the European Commission in early August 2021 warning against halting deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers, despite the Taliban&#39;s advance in their homeland. However, Germany, along with another signatory of the letter, the Netherlands, subsequently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/">announced</a> that they would not deport the unaccepted Afghans for the time being due to the development of the conflict. However, Austria <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/">did not change</a> its position and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-austria-pm-wont-take-in-any-more-afghanistan-refugees-taliban/">ruled out</a> accepting people fleeing Afghanistan, saying that this would not happen during his term in office. The Greek Minister for Migration, whose country <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/grafika-reseni-migracni-krize/r~1a7e43b8e45911e59e52002590604f2e/">faced</a> a strong influx of migrants due to its position during the last crisis and is another signatory of the letter, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/">said</a> that &quot; <i>the EU is not prepared and does not have the capacity to handle another major migration crisis</i> &quot;.</p>
