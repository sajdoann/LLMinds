<p>Petr Fiala answered <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030501017/#t=48m28s">a question</a> in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions (video, time 48:28) that mentioned that more than a million voters lost their votes in the parliamentary elections, and are therefore not represented in the Chamber of Deputies. Petr Fiala stated (time 49:22) that <i>&quot;good government governs for everyone, even for those who did not vote for it&quot;</i> . He then illustrates this position by referring to his older statement from the election staff, which is the content of the verified statement.</p><p> Petr Fiala, in the SPOLU coalition&#39;s election staff, gave his first post-election speech on October 9, when <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3383514-zmeny-je-tady-my-jsme-ji-slibili-my-ji-udelame-rekl-lidr-spolu-fiala">he said</a> (video, time 1:52): <i>&quot;(…) I would like to ask you something in this context. All of you who are watching us. It doesn&#39;t matter who you voted for, it doesn&#39;t matter what your political preferences are. First and foremost, we are all citizens of the Czech Republic who want to live here and we want to live here together, as neighbors, as friends, as colleagues. That is what unites us all.&quot;</i></p><p> Let us add that the SPOLU coalition <a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps124?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xkraj=0&amp;xstrana=13&amp;xv=1">, consisting of</a> ODS, TOP 09 and KDU-ČSL, won <a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps2?xjazyk=CZ">27.79%</a> of the votes in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, finishing first.</p>
