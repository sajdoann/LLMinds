<p>Miloš Zeman spoke about the need to abolish tax exemptions in the Chamber of Deputies in <a href="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/035schuz/s035223.htm">2019</a> , and a year later, in his budget speech at <a href="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/062schuz/index.htm">the 62nd meeting</a> of the Chamber of Deputies, <a href="https://www.hrad.cz/cs/prezident-cr/soucasny-prezident-cr/vybrane-projevy-a-rozhovory/projev-prezidenta-republiky-pri-62.-schuzi-poslanecke-snemovny-15653">he stated</a> : <i>&quot;We calculated with Minister Schillerová that abolishing tax exemptions and reliefs would represent 380 billion crowns.&quot;</i> However, it is not certain how they calculated this 380 billion, because the former Minister of Finance Alena Schillerová herself later <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/v-mediich/2021/ministryne-financi-alena-schillerova-hos-41828">mentioned</a> 300 billion in <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3310573-schillerova-vidi-cestu-z-krize-v-investicich-dle-wagenknechta-a-zamrazilove-se">an interview</a> on Czech Television, while in <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/v-mediich/2021/nechme-dane-nizke-zrusme-vyjimky-41999">a second</a> interview she spoke about 330 billion.</p><p> In addition to the Minister&#39;s words, the last official calculation of tax reliefs was from 2018, when, according to <a href="https://www.kurzy.cz/zpravy/597053-muze-ceskou-verejnou-kasu-zachranit-zruseni-danovych-vyjimek/">estimates</a> by the Ministry of Finance (MF), the total value was over 500 billion crowns. The total tax relief is calculated from tax reliefs for personal income tax, corporate income tax and value added tax. According to <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=20996">the document</a> (.pdf, p. 1) Quantification of tax reliefs in the Czech Republic for 2018, which was published as an annex to the Fiscal Outlook of the Ministry of Finance, the total tax reliefs in 2018 amounted to <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=20996">520 billion CZK</a> (.pdf, p. 5).</p><p> At the same time, however, <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=20996">there is no</a> (.pdf, p. 1) uniform methodology for calculating these reliefs and no other restrictive rules for the form of tax relief analysis are given. The difference in the estimate of the Ministry of Finance and Alena Schillerová may therefore be caused by a different methodology.</p><p> The state budget deficit should amount to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2020-600#p1-1">500 billion</a> crowns this year according to the State Budget Act, but this plan is unlikely to be fulfilled. The state budget <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2021/pokladni-plneni-sr-43761">ended</a> with a deficit of 401.5 billion crowns at the end of November, and it can therefore be assumed that the resulting deficit for 2021 will not be much higher. The aforementioned 380 billion crowns almost reach this year&#39;s estimated deficit.</p><p> Miloš Zeman is therefore correct in stating that he spoke about tax exemptions in the past in the Chamber of Deputies and even mentioned the amount of 380 billion crowns at that time. This sum does not correspond to the estimates of the former Minister of Finance or the estimates of the Ministry of Finance from 2018. Although they differ significantly, Miloš Zeman&#39;s 380 billion is between these estimates, which also do not have a uniform methodology. We therefore assess his statement as true with reservations.</p><p> For context, let us add that <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/assets/cs/media/Dane_Zprava_2014_o-danovych-ulevach-v-Ceske-republice-za-roky-2011-2015.pdf">a tax relief</a> is a measure (.pdf, p. 5) that is an advantage for the taxpayer in the form of lower or later tax payments compared to the situation where such a measure would not be included in the law. The reason for introducing a tax relief may be to support other public policies (for example, reducing taxes for taxpayers whose economic activity the state wants to support), achieving greater efficiency of the tax system (for example, exempting taxpayers with relatively low or zero incomes), or a combination of both.</p><p> Tax reliefs include, for example, tax exemptions, items reducing the tax base, items reducing the tax, reduced tax rates, etc. More specifically, for personal income tax, tax-exempt items include, for example, income in the form of awards in <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-586#p4-1-f">the field of culture</a> , income in the form <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-586#p4-1-k">of scholarships</a> from the state budget or from university funds.</p>
