<p>We were unable to find the letter mentioned by Petr Fiala in publicly available sources, so we contacted the European Commission Representation in the Czech Republic to ask whether the President of the European Commission had received the letter from Prime Minister Petr Fiala with the request that Fiala was talking about.</p><p> The Head of the Representation&#39;s Press Department, <a href="https://czechia.representation.ec.europa.eu/novinky-udalosti/tiskove-centrum_cs">Magdaléna Frouzová,</a> confirmed to us that European Commission President Von Der Leyen received a letter from Fiala: <i>&quot;Yes, we can confirm that the President of the Commission received a letter from the Czech Prime Minister, in which she formulates the position of the Czech government supporting the inclusion of gas and nuclear energy in the EU taxonomy, in full accordance with the resolution adopted by both chambers of the Czech Parliament on December 15, 2021.&quot;</i></p><p> Petr Fiala also refers to the resolution of the Czech Parliament in his statement. On December 14, 2021, the Chamber of Deputies <a href="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2021ps/stenprot/004schuz/bqbs/b02100901.htm">voted</a> on <i>the Resolution of the Parliament on the necessary role of nuclear energy in the decarbonization of the economy</i> . This is <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=15300">a resolution</a> according to which the Chamber of Deputies:</p><ul><li> notes that the Czech Republic has committed to the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal,</li><li> appreciates that the EU recognises the right of Member States to freely choose the composition of their energy mix,</li><li> stresses that the Czech Republic, due to its geographical conditions, is unable to meet its obligations without the use of nuclear energy,</li><li> recalls that the important role of nuclear energy was also confirmed by the President of the European Commission,</li><li> therefore notes that nuclear energy must be fully recognised as part of the solution for decarbonising the economy. It cannot be seen as just a &quot;transitional&quot; category, but as a tool that &quot;enables&quot; the low-carbon transformation of the economy and makes it economically and socially sustainable in the long term. The criteria for the sustainability of the low-carbon transformation of the economy should be technologically neutral and must not differentiate between generations of nuclear installations or reactor technology,</li><li> also notes that the Czech Republic intends to temporarily use natural gas in its mix,</li><li> Calls on the EU to include gas as a transitional source and nuclear energy as a sustainable source,</li><li> instructs Andrej Babiš, the outgoing Prime Minister, to present this opinion to the European Council at its meeting on 15 December 2021.</li></ul><p> The majority of deputies, with the exception of SPD representatives, voted <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=77438&amp;l=cz">in favor of</a> this proposal. The Senate also <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/senat-ve-shode-se-snemovnou-podporil-vyuzivani-jaderne-energie/2133449">supported</a> the Chamber of Deputies&#39; resolution the following day.</p>
