<p>Alena Schillerová <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/statni-zamestnanci-platy-za-rok-2020-vzrust-prumerneho-platu_2105150933_kuc">spoke</a> about freezing the salaries of civil servants in the spring of 2021. According to the former Minister of Finance, salaries should only <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/v-mediich/2021/schillerova-vyvoj-pandemie-rozhodne-o-no-41240">be increased</a> for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers as part of the consolidation of public finances. Although <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/schillerova-chci-obnovit-eet-40358028">she stated</a> several times in <a href="https://cnn.iprima.cz/pojdme-rusit-danove-vyjimky-vyzvala-alena-schillerova-dane-pry-zvysovat-nechce-23442">April</a> that she did not want to reduce the salaries of firefighters and police officers, she did not talk about increasing their salaries.</p><p> Let us also add that in <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3326254-odbory-kritizuji-plan-na-zmrazeni-platu-statnich-zamestnancu-schillerova-na-nem">June 2021</a> , the government of Andrej Babiš approved a draft state budget, which envisaged that the salary freeze would apply not only to civil servants, but also to police officers, firefighters and soldiers. The only exception was to be teachers&#39; salaries. Alena Schillerová stated at the time that the government could not afford to increase the salaries of civil servants due to the high state budget deficit.</p><p> The then Minister of the Interior, Hamáček, <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/hamacek-rakusan-fiala-rozpocet-bis.A210829_120337_domaci_vlc">had</a> long opposed freezing the salaries of police officers and firefighters, and on the contrary, proposed a 3.5% increase in salaries for these groups.</p><p> However, former Minister Schillerová finally reversed course in September 2021 and <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/platy-statnich-zamestnancu-nakonec-vzrostou-potvrdila-poprve-schillerova-40372366">agreed</a> to increase the salaries of all civil servants, including firefighters and police officers, although debates continued over the rate of increase. The ČSSD opposed a percentage increase and proposed a fixed monetary amount. In mid- <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3398176-zive-vlada-k-mimoradne-pomoci-kvuli-zdrazovani-energii">November</a> , Andrej Babiš&#39;s government finally approved a blanket <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/od-ledna-se-zvysi-platy-ve-statnim-a-verejnem-sektoru-o-1-400-korun--rozhodla-vlada-191806/">increase in civil servants&#39; salaries</a> by more than a thousand crowns, starting in January 2022.</p><p> On December 29, 2021, the government of Petr Fiala <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/vlada-prida-socialnim-pracovnikum-zdravotnikum-a-ucitelum/2138652">approved</a> a salary increase for only some civil servants. The new government had previously announced that it did not agree with a blanket increase. The salaries of social service workers are to increase by 700 crowns from January 2022, the salaries of healthcare workers by 6% and teachers by 2%. The government also approved an increase in the salaries of soldiers, firefighters and police officers by 700 crowns. The government of Petr Fiala decided to freeze the salaries of civil servants in ministries and other offices from January.</p><p> In the spring of last year, Alena Schillerová publicly declared that she wanted to save on the salaries of civil servants as part of the consolidation. She wanted to increase salaries only for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers. In September, she proposed increasing salaries for all civil servants. However, neither position corresponds to the move by the Fiala government. The government increased salaries for more groups of employees than Alena Schillerová proposed in the spring, but at the same time, the new cabinet increased salaries by less than the then minister had planned in September.</p><p> Petr Fiala thus incorrectly states that his government did exactly what Alena Schillerová proposed. Moreover, the Prime Minister points out the former minister&#39;s alleged hypocrisy by drawing attention to her relatively restrictive stance from the spring, but neglecting her more budgetary-relaxed position from September 2021.</p>
