    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: And as Prime Minister, I think, on December 22nd, I sent a letter on behalf of the Czech Republic to the President of the European Commission, where I say: our government considers the core to be extremely important, I ask you to take this into account when making decisions, and here I am attaching the decision of our Parliament, which shows that this is what the Czech Republic wants across the political spectrum.\nSECTION B: I would like to recall the statements of the former Minister of Finance, Mrs. Schillerov√°, from the spring of last year, when she said that the path to budget consolidation lies, among other things, in not valorizing, not increasing the salaries of employees in the state sector. And that only the salaries of teachers, firefighters, police officers, and so on will increase. And that is exactly what we did.\nSECTION C: And I already said in my first post-election speech, let&#39;s overcome those differences, we respect, of course, that we have different political opinions, we vote for different parties, we have different ideas about what the level of taxes should be, and so on, but we are all citizens of the Czech Republic, we have to live together here as neighbors, as collaborators.\nSECTION D: Economists say that about half of it (inflation, note: Demagog.cz) is caused by international influences. But - and this is important and both independent economists and, for example, the Czech National Bank agree on this - half of it is due to the poor management of our state and the way the previous government managed its finances.\nSECTION E: It was not easy for ODS, as a strong party and a long-term traditional party in the Czech political system, not to field a candidate in all 27 districts, and we did it anyway, we did not field one, sometimes we made an agreement, we supported someone else, and what did it ultimately lead to, weakening ODS? No, strengthening it. We won the Senate elections by a landslide.\nSECTION F: Today, the situation is significantly (...) different from the migration wave in 2015-2016. And what is different is that at that time, some European countries actually wanted to accept migrants and a dispute arose within Europe. And that is not the case today. If you look at the statements of all the leading representatives of European countries, including Germany, including the Netherlands, not to mention Austria, they all say no, this time we cannot accept any migration wave.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
