<p>Petr Fiala talks about the ratio of international and domestic influences that contribute to the increase in inflation. No studies that would determine exactly how individual components contribute to the increase in inflation <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030500912/">have</a> apparently been conducted (video, 9:02).</p><p> Economists such as <a href="https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/">Jan Švejnar</a> (video, 0:46) and <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030500912/">Štěpán Jurajda</a> (video, 8:57) include, for example, the disruption of import chains, i.e. delays or shortages of some raw materials, among the international influences on price increases. Some input raw materials can also become more expensive, the main ones recently being <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/energy-chaos-adds-to-inflation-angst-for-europe-s-policy-makers?sref=qI83munY">energy</a> , <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3379052-kremikove-trzni-peklo-zdrazil-o-tri-sta-procent-a-do-problemu-dostal-mnoho-odvetvi">silicon</a> , <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3383072-kvuli-nedostatku-cipu-automobilky-prijdou-o-biliony-korun-nedodelana-auta-stoji">chips</a> or <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/zdrazovani-materialu-cesko-ceny-stavba-rekonstrukce_2111021338_ern">building materials</a> such as <a href="https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/">wood</a> (video, 3:08). The costs of <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3364898-lodni-doprava-zdrazuje-za-zbozi-z-ciny-si-zakaznici-priplati-i-v-cesku">shipping</a> and <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/silnicni-dopravci-zdrazi-az-o-ctvrtinu-40375524">land</a> transport have also increased. Therefore, this type of inflation is called <a href="https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/">supply-side inflation</a> (video, 3:08), which is caused by an increase in the prices of inputs to production.</p><p> As for the domestic influences that contribute to this wave of rising inflation, we can mention, for example, the words of the head of the National Budget Council <a href="https://echo24.cz/a/Sx5mc/ceka-nas-to-nejhorsi-ekonomove-reaguji-na-tvrdy-boj-cnb-s-inflaci">, Eva Zamrazilová:</a> <i>&quot;The connection between inflation and the legacy of the previous fiscal policy is obvious, and we have repeatedly pointed out this fact. The problem of inflation certainly cannot be brushed off the table by saying that it is purely global imported inflation.&quot;</i></p><p> Economist <a href="https://forbes.cz/horska-hleda-se-vinik-inflace-jen-globalni-problemy-za-ni-nemohou/">Helena Horská</a> , for example, talks about the government&#39;s influence on price increases. She states that when the economy reopens, most restaurateurs, hoteliers, and service providers in general will increase their prices to offset losses from the lockdown period and meet increased deferred demand. She also adds: <i>&quot;This demand is being inflated by other factors. Specifically, the abolition of the super-gross wage, the increase in pensions beyond the framework of valorization, the abolition of the real estate acquisition tax, and other steps that have loosened budgetary discipline so much that even after the pandemic subsides, the state treasury is expected to be short of almost 400 billion crowns during the economic boom.&quot;</i> However, Helena Horská does not see government policy as the main cause of inflation.</p><p> The only government influence is a short quote <a href="https://www.e15.cz/volby/volby-do-snemovny/vlada-je-spoluvinikem-inflace-zbytecne-utraci-dluh-statu-rychle-roste-a-je-stale-drazsi-1383895">from Petr Kříž</a> in the daily E15, who lists high state budget deficits or rising pensions as causes. However, such statements are exceptions. According to the rest of the article and other economists cited here, however, government policy is not the main culprit of the current inflation.</p><p> The CNB <a href="https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/komentare-cnb-ke-zverejnenym-statistickym-udajum-o-inflaci-a-hdp/Inflace-v-zari-2021-vysoko-nad-prognozou-CNB-a-horni-hranici-tolerancniho-pasma-cile/">sees the cause of the current high inflation elsewhere</a> than in &quot;poor state management&quot;. According to it, one of the main causes is <i>&quot;a surge in consumer demand after the dismantling of anti-epidemic measures&quot;,</i> which leads to a sharp increase in prices in the service sector, while at the same time the growth in prices of goods has accelerated, as Helena Horská also <a href="https://forbes.cz/horska-hleda-se-vinik-inflace-jen-globalni-problemy-za-ni-nemohou/">states</a> . However, according to the CNB, this effect also occurs in other countries. The CNB <a href="https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/komentare-cnb-ke-zverejnenym-statistickym-udajum-o-inflaci-a-hdp/Inflace-v-zari-2021-vysoko-nad-prognozou-CNB-a-horni-hranici-tolerancniho-pasma-cile/">identified</a> another significant cause of inflation as &quot; <i>the high growth in industrial producer prices in the world due to disruptions in supply chains, to which is added a significant increase in the price of many raw materials and materials&quot;.</i> At the end of its commentary, the CNB writes about <i>&quot;unexpectedly strong and widespread inflationary pressures from the domestic and foreign economies&quot;</i> . CNB Governor Rusnok has previously <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/cnb-prekvapila-uroky-vyskocily-na-150-175938">pointed out</a> that the government&#39;s budgetary policy is at least partly causing today&#39;s level of inflation. On the other hand, CNB Councilor Aleš Michl <a href="https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/autorske-clanky-rozhovory-s-predstaviteli-cnb/Nesmysly-o-inflaci/">stated</a> that the government <i>&quot;cannot really be held responsible&quot;</i> for inflation.</p><p> Petr Fiala emphasizes in his statement that economists and the Czech National Bank attribute equal credit for rising inflation to international factors and the previous government&#39;s economic management. The statements of some economists may be in line with the Prime Minister&#39;s statement, although this is clearly a minority position. However, the published positions of representatives of the Czech National Bank are completely inconsistent with the Prime Minister&#39;s statement - the Czech National Bank attributes the main responsibility for rising inflation to international influences. We therefore assess Fiala&#39;s statement as untrue.</p><p> Let us add that in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/0/2-17122021-AP-EN.pdf/ebf0659e-db3c-fc20-9faa-e74964b1827d">November</a> (.pdf) 2021, the inflation rate in the Czech Republic was below the European Union average, at 4.8 percent. Finally, let us also state that we have verified Petr Fiala&#39;s <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/21147">statements</a> about <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/21233">inflation</a> in the past.</p>
