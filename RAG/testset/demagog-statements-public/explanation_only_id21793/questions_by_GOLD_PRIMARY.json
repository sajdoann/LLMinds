    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: On the other hand, those who babble that it is nationalization should realize that a similar position was taken by the American administration, which you certainly cannot suspect of Bolshevism. For example, with General Motors. So they entered there and when General Motors got back on its feet, they sold their share again. \nSECTION B: Let me start the same way I did when I met with about a hundred foreign ambassadors. I said to them: Welcome to a successful country. A country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, that has stable economic growth, that has a relatively declining and relatively low national debt. A country where both the average wage and old-age pensions are growing.\nSECTION C: There were some property disputes there (at TV NOVA, note: Demagog.cz) and unfortunately we had to pay a fine of 10 billion crowns also because some institution, I don&#39;t know now if it was the media committee of the Chamber of Deputies or someone like that, said that everything was fine. So we agreed to it, and well, it wasn&#39;t fine.\nSECTION D: Mr. Balák did not personally enrich himself in this case. Secondly, there was no economic damage. And thirdly, he received three years in prison for allegedly giving a favor to a construction company, by the way, it was the Kladno company ESG with Jaromír Jágr, (...) and the favor consisted of allowing it to tour the Lánská obora.\nSECTION E: (...) a proposal that I have repeatedly expressed in my budget speeches in the Chamber of Deputies. This proposal consists of abolishing tax exemptions. If all tax exemptions were abolished, I said that it would save 380 billion crowns. Which is almost as much as the estimated state budget deficit this year.\nSECTION F: If I appoint him as Prime Minister, he will form a government, go to the Chamber of Deputies with that government and ask for confidence. If he does not receive that confidence, the President has one more chance to appoint the Prime Minister, it could be the same one, it could be the second one on the list, and so on, and according to the Constitution, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies then has a third chance.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
