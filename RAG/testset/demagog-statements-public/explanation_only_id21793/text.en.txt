<p>On March 26, 2022, President Zeman <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/milos-balak-milost-lany-prezident-zeman-zduvodneni-ustni-zadost_2204160500_tec">pardoned</a> Miloš Balák, director of the Lány Forestry Administration, a contributory organization of the Office of the President of the Republic. Balák was <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/lesni-sprava-lany-soud-milos-balak-libor-tkadlec-obzaloba-zakazka_2105070933_ban">sentenced</a> to three years in prison in May last year for manipulating the contract for securing and draining the slopes of the Lány reservoir. <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">He was</a> also fined 1.8 million crowns and banned from working in the state administration for four years (counting from his release from prison). The sentence was subsequently <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/odvolaci-soud-se-bude-zabyvat-kauzou-sefa-lesni-spravy-balaka/2182343">confirmed by</a> the Regional Court in Prague on March 24, 2022.</p><p> In addition to Miloš Balák, the manager of the company Energie - stavební a báňská (ESB), Libor Tkadlec, was also <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/odvolaci-soud-se-bude-zabyvat-kauzou-sefa-lesni-spravy-balaka/2182343">sentenced</a> . He received a suspended sentence and <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">a fine of</a> 600 thousand crowns from the court. The company ESB received a fine of 5.4 million crowns and a ban on participating in public procurement for 3 years. Let us add that although Miloš Zeman uses the abbreviation &quot;ESG&quot;, he clearly means the company ESB.</p><p> The entire case <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3459550-balak-z-lesni-spravy-lany-musi-na-tri-roky-do-vezeni-potvrdil-soud">stems</a> from the manipulation of a public contract worth more than 200 million crowns. Specifically, it concerns a tender for securing and draining the slopes of the Klíčava reservoir in Lánská obor.</p><p> According to the court <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">ruling</a> , Miloš Balák determined the contractor in advance. At the same time, he allowed ESB to participate in the preparation of the project and made non-public information available to the company, which the company used to win the tender. Libor Tkadlec then <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3459550-balak-z-lesni-spravy-lany-musi-na-tri-roky-do-vezeni-potvrdil-soud">mentioned</a> in wiretaps that he planned to overvalue some items of the contract.</p><p> The police also <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">commissioned</a> an expert report to calculate the profit from the illegal acquisition of the contract. ESB&#39;s profit was supposed to be almost 9 million crowns, but due to the initiation of criminal proceedings, this <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/lesni-sprava-lany-soud-milos-balak-libor-tkadlec-obzaloba-zakazka_2105070933_ban">did not happen</a> . <i>&quot;It is a minimalist version. It could easily have been more, given how the defendants planned it,&quot;</i> <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">commented</a> the judge, who issued a non-final verdict on the entire case last year.</p><p> According to police wiretaps, Libor Tkadlec <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">planned</a> to obtain tens of millions of crowns from the budget of the Office of the President of the Republic. However, due to the activities of the police, Chancellor Mynář had some of the ongoing work stopped, so the final price of the tender was 191 million crowns. However, the value of the contract was originally supposed to be 230 million.</p><p> The ESB <a href="https://www.energie-as.cz/management-spolecnosti.html?id=128">board of directors</a> includes hockey player Jaromír Jágr. However, it is important to mention that he <a href="https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vysledky?subjektId=494059&amp;typ=UPLNY">was not</a> a member during the illegal conduct. He only became a member in 2021, while the Miloš Balák case itself <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">started</a> after a police intervention in Lány in 2017. At that time, however, his father, Jaromír Jágr Sr., <a href="https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vysledky?subjektId=494059&amp;typ=UPLNY">was</a> the vice-chairman of the board.</p><p> Let us add that the head of the Lán Forestry Administration is now <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/balaka-obzalovali-za-prodej-kamene-ze-sidla-prezidenta/r~768dee82fb4711eb8a900cc47ab5f122/">being indicted</a> in another case. He allegedly <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/lany-misto-kamenolomu-terenni-upravy/r~efd3b39ac08511ecb5bd0cc47ab5f122/">turned</a> the Lán forest into a quarry without the proper permit, extracted a total of 40,000 tons of stone, and then sold some of it below cost to the ESB company, which was also involved in the dam slope modification case.</p><p> Finally, let us summarize our assessment. From the available information, it is not clear that Miloš Balák directly enriched himself by favoring ESB. It is also not clear whether the state suffered financial damage. ESB&#39;s profit from the unauthorized acquisition of the contract was supposed to be almost 9 million crowns (according to the court, at least 9 million), but due to the initiation of criminal prosecution, this did not happen.</p><p> Nevertheless, we assess Miloš Zeman&#39;s statement as untrue. It is not true that Balák only allowed ESB to inspect the Lánská obora before the tender was announced. Based on the court ruling, it is clear that he collaborated with Balák on the project planning and provided it with non-public information even before the tender was announced. According to the court, the head of the forest administration thus determined the contractor in advance.</p>
