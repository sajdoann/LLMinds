    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: Let me start the same way I did when I met with about a hundred foreign ambassadors. I said to them: Welcome to a successful country. A country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, that has stable economic growth, that has a relatively declining and relatively low national debt. A country where both the average wage and old-age pensions are growing.\nSECTION B: If I appoint him as Prime Minister, he will form a government, go to the Chamber of Deputies with that government and ask for confidence. If he does not receive that confidence, the President has one more chance to appoint the Prime Minister, it could be the same one, it could be the second one on the list, and so on, and according to the Constitution, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies then has a third chance.\nSECTION C: Václav Havel granted two thousand pardons, Václav Klaus four hundred, I twenty, or more precisely twenty-one. Among these pardons there was no parricide, because Václav Havel granted a pardon to the parricide Mr. Odložil, there was no restitution fraudster, while Václav Havel granted a pardon to Mrs. Chadimová, who was then defended by Pavel Rychetský.\nSECTION D: Mr. Balák did not personally enrich himself in this case. Secondly, there was no economic damage. And thirdly, he received three years in prison for allegedly giving a favor to a construction company, by the way, it was the Kladno company ESG with Jaromír Jágr, (...) and the favor consisted of allowing it to tour the Lánská obora.\nSECTION E: On the other hand, those who babble that it is nationalization should realize that a similar position was taken by the American administration, which you certainly cannot suspect of Bolshevism. For example, with General Motors. So they entered there and when General Motors got back on its feet, they sold their share again. \nSECTION F: (...) a proposal that I have repeatedly expressed in my budget speeches in the Chamber of Deputies. This proposal consists of abolishing tax exemptions. If all tax exemptions were abolished, I said that it would save 380 billion crowns. Which is almost as much as the estimated state budget deficit this year.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
