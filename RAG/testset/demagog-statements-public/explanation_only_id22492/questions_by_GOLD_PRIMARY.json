    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: And here, yes, is Article 122 (of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU - note by Demagog.cz), former Article 100: If a Member State encounters difficulties or is seriously threatened by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may, under certain conditions, grant the Member State concerned financial assistance from the Union.\nSECTION B: Kateřina Perknerová: But the marginal issue is certainly not the bribery affair at the Ministry of Transport, when former Minister Kremlík did not report the alleged corrupt offer of 1.5 million crowns. Andrej Babiš: He reported it. Kateřina Perknerová: He told the head of the BIS three weeks after the bribe offer. A normal person acts differently, right? Andrej Babiš: That&#39;s true.\n\nSECTION C: I requested from the Ministry of Finance a list of goods and services where VAT was reduced during our period. This (passenger transport, note Demagog.cz) was the only item where we did not do it (we did not vote for a VAT reduction, note Demagog.cz), because transport companies would make money from it without it being reflected in reduced fares for people.\nSECTION D: That project (modification of the government&#39;s powers when sending soldiers abroad, note: Demagog.cz) comes from our government and clearly states: if terrorists capture our people (...), we will send our anti-terrorist commando there, and no one will know about it, yes, but I fundamentally disagree with the government deciding without Parliament whether foreign soldiers will be here or whether we will send soldiers somewhere else.\nSECTION E: We can now talk in principle about the fact that Europe has never borrowed. Here is the Treaty on the European Community. And here Article 311 says: The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to achieve its objectives and to successfully implement its policies. The budget is financed entirely from its own resources, other revenues are not affected.\nSECTION F: On August 17th, we send the manual to schools, traffic lights. On August 19th, the Ministry of Health announces across the board, as Mr. Fiala asked, I also asked what happened, it turned out that the expert groups under Adam Vojtěch had a completely different opinion and misled him, and then he cleaned up his act, and from August 24th, Mrs. Rážová was responsible for it.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
