<p>Andrej Babiš responds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dt4U64I-4K4?feature=share&amp;t=1443">to the moderator&#39;s question</a> (video, time 24:03) in the debate whether he would support the government&#39;s <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3557390-zive-snemovna-schvaluje-zakon-proti-sireni-teroristickeho-obsahu-na-webu">proposal</a> to amend the Constitution, according to which the government would <i>&nbsp;</i> could send soldiers abroad <i>&quot;for example, to rescue Czech citizens&quot;</i> without <a href="https://advokatnidenik.cz/2022/06/13/ministerstvo-obrany-predklada-vlade-upravu-vysilani-vojaku-do-zahranici/">the prior</a> consent of Parliament ( <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=213556">.pdf</a> , p. 1). In his response, the chairman of the ANO movement stated that the proposal to change the rules of government powers still came &quot;from his government&quot; and in connection with this proposal he mentioned only the case of rescuing Czechs abroad.</p><p> The currently under discussion draft amendment to the Constitution, which regulates the rules for sending Czech soldiers abroad and the passage of allied troops through the territory of the Czech Republic, <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vojaci-ustava-vlada-zahranici-obrana-prelet-prejezd-novela-parlament-snemovna_2206221358_mst">was submitted to</a> the Chamber of Deputies by Petr Fiala&#39;s cabinet <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=252">on June 22</a> , 2022. According to this amendment, the government would no longer need the consent of Parliament to allow the movement of foreign troops on the territory of the Czech Republic ( <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=213558">.pdf</a> ) or to send troops to foreign territory for the purpose of protecting <i>&quot;life and health, threatening property values or the security of the Czech Republic&quot;</i> ( <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=213556">.pdf</a> , pp. 1, 14), i.e., for example, when <a href="https://advokatnidenik.cz/2022/06/13/ministerstvo-obrany-predklada-vlade-upravu-vysilani-vojaku-do-zahranici/">rescuing</a> Czech citizens. However, this authority would continue to be limited to a period of 60 days, after which the stay of troops outside the Czech Republic would have to be approved by Parliament, as is the case <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl43-4">now</a> .</p><p> The current proposal thus <a href="https://advokatnidenik.cz/2022/06/13/ministerstvo-obrany-predklada-vlade-upravu-vysilani-vojaku-do-zahranici/">expands</a> the range of defined cases in which the government can send soldiers outside Czech territory for a maximum of 60 days without prior parliamentary approval. According to the current <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl43-4">wording</a> of the Constitution, it can only decide in three situations: when <i>&quot;fulfilling obligations from international treaties on mutual defense against attack&quot;</i> , when participating in peacekeeping operations and during rescue work after natural disasters or industrial and ecological accidents.</p><p> In the past, other proposals to adjust the government&#39;s powers in this area have been submitted to the Chamber of Deputies ( <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=213556">.pdf</a> , p. 4). The first of these was submitted during the government <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2013-cr/bohuslav_sobotka/prehled-clenu-vlady-bohuslava-sobotky-29-01-2014---trva-124534/">of Bohuslav Sobotka</a> in <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=7&amp;T=956">2016</a> by a group of deputies, including the then <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/martin-stropnicky-115391/">Minister</a> of Defense for the ANO movement <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/detail.sqw?o=7&amp;id=443">Martin Stropnický</a> . The second was a proposal from <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=557&amp;sp=1">2019</a> , submitted by deputies from the ODS, ANO movement, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL and STAN. Former <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2018-cr/andrej-babis-ii/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-27-6-2018-trva-175411/">Prime Minister</a> Andrej Babiš was also among the submitters at that time.</p><p> The aforementioned proposals from 2016 ( <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=116747">.pdf</a> , p. 16) and 2019 ( <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=167115">.pdf</a> , p. 22) proposed <a href="https://advokatnidenik.cz/2022/06/13/ministerstvo-obrany-predklada-vlade-upravu-vysilani-vojaku-do-zahranici/">to remove</a> from the text of the Constitution the above-mentioned three conditions under which the government can send soldiers abroad for a maximum of 60 days without the prior consent of Parliament.</p><p> Among <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=116747">the arguments</a> (.pdf, pp. 2–3) for introducing this change, both proposals (in almost identical wording) stated that <i>&quot;under the current regulation, for example, it would be extremely difficult to promptly dispatch the armed forces of the Czech Republic to save the lives of Czech citizens illegally detained abroad&quot;</i> ( <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=167115">.pdf</a> , pp. 3–4).</p><p> At the same time, however, these materials mentioned ( <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=167115">.pdf</a> , pp. 4–5) that the amendments are also necessary so that the Czech Republic can send units abroad as part of the so-called NATO Very Rapid Reaction Force (VJTF) without the consent of Parliament even in cases that do not fall under <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl43-4">Article 43, paragraph 4</a> of the Constitution. That is, in situations beyond the scope of <i>&quot;</i> <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl43-4-a"><i>fulfillment</i></a> <i>of obligations under international treaties on collective defense against attack&quot;</i> .</p><p> The proposed changes were intended to allow the government <i>to &quot;operatively decide on the deployment of the Czech Armed Forces outside the territory of the Czech Republic and on the stay of the armed forces of other states on the territory of the Czech Republic without specifying the purpose of the deployment or stay&quot;</i> ( <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=167115">.pdf</a> , p. 18).</p><p> In conclusion, let us summarize that the amendments to the government&#39;s powers when sending soldiers abroad were indeed proposed by MPs, including representatives of the ANO movement, at the time when the ANO movement was part of the government and later also at the time when Andrej Babiš was the Prime Minister. However, in his statement, the Chairman of the ANO movement connects the proposal for the rapid sending of Czech soldiers abroad without the prior consent of Parliament only with the situation of saving Czech citizens. At the same time, however, he does not add that the documents, one of which he himself <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=557&amp;sp=1">signed</a> , also proposed that the government could send the Czech Army abroad for 60 days without the consent of Parliament, and without any restrictions. For this reason, we assess his statement as misleading.</p>
