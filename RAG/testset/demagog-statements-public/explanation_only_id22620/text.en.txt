<p><strong>Context</strong></p><p> Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka is talking about a possible decision by the Constitutional Court (ÚS) regarding the newly adopted reduction in pension valorization in June 2023. The ANO movement is currently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqIebm42vdI">working</a> (video) on a complaint (or <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p64-1">a proposal</a> to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl87-1-a">repeal</a> the law) with which it wants to challenge the amendment to the Pension Valorization Act. The SPD movement also wants <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572040-na-ustavni-soud-se-opozice-obrati-jakmile-zmena-valorizace-duchodu-vyjde-ve-sbirce">to join</a> the submission.</p><p> Let us mention that due to the newly adopted amendment to the law, which was also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu">signed by</a> President Petr Pavel, during the extraordinary valorization of pensions in June, pensions <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">will increase</a> on average by only CZK 760 ( <a href="https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/">.doc</a> , p. 1). According to the previously valid <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22604">rules</a> , the average pension should have increased by <a href="https://www.penize.cz/starobni-duchod/439182-zvyseni-duchodu-v-cervnu-spocitejte-si-rozdil-valorizace">CZK 1,770</a> . According to <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-schvalila-upravene-parametry-valorizace-duchodu--prumerny-starobni-duchodce-dostane-o-760-korun-vice-203160/">the government</a> , the change is necessary because without the adjustments, the “ <i>public finance deficit would have increased by more than CZK 34 billion”</i> this year. The government now expects that pension spending will increase by only CZK 15 billion ( <a href="https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/">.doc</a> , p. 5–6).</p><p> The opposition <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu">cites</a> several reasons for submitting the proposal to the Constitutional Court. The first is the so-called <a href="https://cit.vfu.cz/ppoz/okruhypdf/1pravnipredpisyzakladnipojmyadruhypravnichpredpisu.pdf">retroactivity</a> (.pdf, pp. 2–3), or retroactive effect. The opposition movement <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">claims</a> that in the case of the amendment, the change in the legal regulation was approved only after the valorization <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-3">mechanism</a> was launched. &quot; <i>We believe that it was created on January 31,&quot;</i> Alena Schillerová <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">justifies</a> retroactivity as one of the pillars of the prepared proposal, because the amendment only entered into <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71">force</a> after the aforementioned date, specifically March 20, 2023.</p><p> The second reason for submitting a motion to repeal the amendment <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">is</a> the state of legislative emergency declared by the government, due to which the submitted government proposal <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=314">is being discussed</a> in an abbreviated session. According to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#f1609384">Act</a> No. 90/1995 Coll., on the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies, such a state can <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#p99-1">be declared</a> in an extraordinary moment &quot; <i>when the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens or the security of the state are fundamentally threatened or when the state is threatened with significant economic damage</i> &quot;. The opposition wants to refute the government&#39;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230403130212/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2329976">argument</a> that the state of legislative emergency was declared precisely because of the risk of &quot;major economic damage&quot;, as it <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">believes</a> that this was unjustified.</p><p> Opposition parties <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">can</a> submit a proposal from March 20, when the amendment <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71">was published</a> in <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392">the Collection of Laws</a> . According to the chairwoman of the ANO parliamentary group, Alena Schillerová, the proposal could <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">reach</a> the Constitutional Court in early May. The movement&#39;s deputy chairman, Radek Vondráček, <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">said</a> on March 19 that this could happen within a month.</p><p> After considering the proposal, the Constitutional Court then <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p70-1">decides</a> whether the law or its individual provisions are in conflict with the Constitution. If the constitutional order has been violated, the court may annul the law in question (in this case, <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392">the amendment</a> to the Act on Lower Pension Valorization) and order the relevant state body to restore the situation prior to the violation of the Constitution. However, in the past, although the Constitutional Court did not consider a decision to be unconstitutional, it published <i>an obiter dictum</i> , which is <a href="https://www.ceska-justice.cz/2020/04/praha-7-ustavni-stiznost-kvuli-koronavirovym-opatrenim-nestahne-jde-nam-judikat-budoucna-tvrdi-starosta-i-pravnici/">a non-authoritative</a> statement beyond the basic reasoning ( <a href="https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf">.pdf</a> , p. 11).</p><p> <strong>Finding to declare a state of emergency</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka mentions the case law when the Constitutional Court found doubts about the method of extending the state of emergency. This <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ustavni-soud-zamitl-zadost-senatoru-unor-nouzovy-stav_2103251028_btk">happened,</a> for example, in March 2021. At that time, the Constitutional Court was considering a proposal by a group of senators to annul the resolution <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2018-cr/andrej-babis-ii/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-27-6-2018-trva-175411/">of the government of</a> Andrej Babiš (ANO) due to the declaration of a state of emergency at the request of the governors, which occurred immediately after the proposal to extend the previous state of emergency was not passed<a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koronavirus-v-cesku-nouzovy-stav-senat_2102171308_pj">by the Chamber of Deputies</a> .</p><p> The Constitutional Court rejected the proposal ( <a href="https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf">.pdf</a> , p. 1) stating that it was not within its competence to decide on such a proposal (.pdf, p. 7. 12). However, as <i>an obiter dictum</i> , it stated ( <a href="https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf">.pdf</a> , p. 7) that &quot; <i>a state of emergency cannot be &#39;newly&#39; declared by the government from the moment the &#39;authorized&#39; state of emergency has ended and the Chamber of Deputies has not agreed to its extension</i> &quot;. As part of <i>the obiter dictum</i> , the Constitutional Court can therefore submit a non-binding statement ( <a href="https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf">.pdf</a> , p. 11) or a recommendation for the legislative process.</p><p> Let us add that in the debate with Minister Jurečka, the moderator asked about option B in the event that the Constitutional Court &quot;swept away&quot; the amendment, that is, if it recognized it as unconstitutional, and thus ordered the government to restore the status quo before the violation of the constitutional system. In such a case, the situation described by Marian Jurečka, that the Constitutional Court would <i>not &quot;change the essence&quot;</i> of the amendment, would not occur. Since the decisions of the Constitutional Court are <a href="https://www.usoud.cz/postaveni-a-pravomoci">binding</a> , <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71">the amended</a> law would have to return to its original form.</p><p> <strong>Finding on the amendment to the pandemic law</strong></p><p> In 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled ( <a href="https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf">.pdf</a> ) in a similar case, where a group of deputies led by Radek Vondráček (ANO) challenged <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=127">the use of</a> a state of legislative emergency to discuss <a href="http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2022-39">an amendment to</a> the pandemic law (Law No. 39/2022 Coll.) at the beginning of 2022. In September 2022, the Constitutional Court rejected the proposal of the opposition deputies ( <a href="https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf">.pdf</a> , p. 1), but in its ruling it stated (p. 24) that <i>&quot;the process leading to the adoption of Law No. 39/2022 Coll. cannot be considered - at a sub-constitutional level - to be flawless&quot;</i> and noted in passing that <i>&quot;the legislative process under review and its course can be considered a reflection of the current political culture, the state of which is characterized, among other things, by numerous obstructionist negotiations, the chaotic agenda and course of meetings, as well as the inflexibility of the legislative process&quot;.</i></p><p> <strong>Final evaluation</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka truthfully states that in the past, when rejecting proposals to repeal a law, the Constitutional Court used non-binding statements, so-called obiter dictums, in which it found, for example, doubts in the legislative process. For this reason, we assess the statement as true.</p>
