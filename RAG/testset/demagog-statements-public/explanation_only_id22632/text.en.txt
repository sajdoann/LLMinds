<p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) is responding to criticism from ANO MP Klára Dostálová, who commented in the debate on the government&#39;s poor communication regarding the planned adjustment of the parameters for regular pension valorization. According to MP Dostálová, Marian Jurečka wants to submit this change too quickly, which is why there will be no time for thorough discussions with the opposition. The head of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs responded by saying that he is not going to submit the amendment in the near future, and noted that he has previously objected to such information.</p><p> <strong>Statement on the negotiations in the week of March 20-26</strong></p><p> First of all, let us mention that the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MLSA) Eva Davidová <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230327123710/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2340047">told</a> ČTK on Friday, March 17, 2023, that the government could discuss the amendment that would amend the rules for pension valorization as early as the week of March 20-26. Eva Davidová also expressed the same opinion on <a href="https://cnn.iprima.cz/porady/zpravy/17032023-0">CNN Prima News</a> (video, 13:54–15:00). Among other things, she stated that she expected the proposal to be <i>&quot;approved by the government during the next week&quot;</i> (video, 14:54).</p><p> Later that same day, however, Marian Jurečka <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-zmeny-valorizaci-penzi-nejsou-na-poradu-dne-jurecka-slibil-standardni-legislativni-proces-40426160">announced</a> that Petr Fiala&#39;s cabinet <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572522-jurecka-chce-v-pristich-tydnech-jednat-o-zmene-valorizace-duchodu-s-opozici-i-odbory">would not</a> discuss such a proposal in the aforementioned week. He specifically stated at a press conference ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mpsvcz/videos/615199293757846">video</a> , 3:10): <i>&quot;I have started to negotiate with representatives of the opposition, in the coming days I will also negotiate (…) with colleagues from the SPD and also with representatives of unions and employers. When I have conducted these consultations with them (…), only</i> then <i>will the interdepartmental comment procedure begin and only then will such material go to the government.&quot;</i></p><p> Let us mention that Marian Jurečka <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572522-jurecka-chce-v-pristich-tydnech-jednat-o-zmene-valorizace-duchodu-s-opozici-i-odbory">met</a> with representatives of the opposition movement ANO before the press conference. The chairwoman of the ANO parliamentary group, Alena Schillerová, later <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-vlada-s-trvalymi-zmenami-penzi-specha-mely-by-platit-uz-od-leta-40426389">told</a> the daily Právo that Minister Jurečka was only supposed to hand over a questionnaire regarding the reform to the participants in the meeting.</p><p> <strong>Statement on the meeting in early April</strong></p><p> However, on March 17, it became quite difficult to understand the individual statements of the representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. The situation was repeated again when the ministry spokesperson stated information that Minister Jurečka subsequently distanced himself from.</p><p> <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-vlada-projedna-zmenu-v-navysovani-penzi-v-dubnu-variantu-ma-pouze-jednu-227939">The Seznam Zprávy</a> server reported in its article on Friday, March 17, that according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230317122628/https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-vlada-projedna-zmenu-v-navysovani-penzi-v-dubnu-variantu-ma-pouze-jednu-227939">the spokesperson</a> for the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the government should approve the adjustment of the valorizations <i>&quot;at its meeting in early April.&quot;</i> The spokesperson also made the same statement on Monday, <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-vlada-s-trvalymi-zmenami-penzi-specha-mely-by-platit-uz-od-leta-40426389">March 20,</a> for the daily Právo, which published her quote the following day ( <i>Právo</i> , March 21, 2023, p. 1). Representatives of the ANO movement subsequently responded to this.</p><p> MP Schillerová <a href="https://twitter.com/alenaschillerov/status/1638165368689639424">criticized</a> Minister Jurečka on Twitter, writing: <i>&quot;The information that</i> [Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka] <i>plans to submit fundamental changes to the valorization mechanisms to the government in early April, effective from July, is absolutely shocking. Especially if the meeting with us, the strongest opposition party, is to take place at the same time. That is a mockery.&quot;</i></p><p> However, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs subsequently <a href="https://twitter.com/MJureka/status/1638269197963907072">defended himself</a> in the discussion below the post:</p><figure class="embed"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="cs" dir="ltr"> And did you notice that I denied this information that appeared in the media on Friday?

According to the ČT24 server, the government coalition wants to count only a third of the growth in real wages into the regular pension increase, not <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-8">half</a> , as is the case now. Let us add that Marian Jurečka also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3573198-jurecka-s-opozici-jedna-o-dalsim-zpomaleni-rustu-penzi-dohoda-je-ale-v-nedohlednu">wants</a> to reduce the benefits of early retirement.</p><p> Marian Jurečka then <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-fiala-spd-po-jednani-s-jureckou-odmitame-snizeni-realnych-duchodu-40426514?fbclid=IwAR05IcQiNxPhTmXIzrFhjmPRUyeRj5nSNB6rbL5ivn8J5wiDUSOjS1V-aJM#source=hp&amp;seq_no=10&amp;dop_ab_variant=0&amp;dop_source_zone_name=novinky.sznhp.box&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_medium=z-boxiku&amp;utm_source=www.seznam.cz">met</a> with SPD representatives on March 22. After this meeting, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230327132436/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2341659">he announced</a> that he was not going to push for an increased retirement age to 68. He also said that his pension commission would be expanded to include representatives of opposition movements.</p><p> Let us add that the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions (ČMKOS) <a href="https://www.cmkos.cz/cs/obsah/219/tiskova-zprava-vlada-je-patrne-bezradna-zrejme-proto-tresta/333054">criticized</a> Minister Jurečka for his communication already in February of this year. The ČMKOS press release specifically <a href="https://www.cmkos.cz/cs/obsah/219/tiskova-zprava-vlada-je-patrne-bezradna-zrejme-proto-tresta/333054#:~:text=%E2%80%9EVl%C3%A1da%20ignoruje%20soci%C3%A1ln%C3%AD%20dialog.%20Ty%20opravdu%20d%C5%AFle%C5%BEit%C3%A9%20materi%C3%A1ly%20pos%C3%ADl%C3%A1%20%C4%8Dasto%20pozd%C4%9B%20a%20pop%C3%ADr%C3%A1%20sv%C3%A1%20vlastn%C3%AD%20slova">states</a> : <i>&quot;The government ignores social dialogue. It often sends these really important materials late and denies its own words.&quot;</i></p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Spokesperson for the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs Eva Davidová told ČTK on Friday, March 17, that Petr Fiala&#39;s government is preparing to discuss the proposal for changing the rules for valorization of pensions in the week from March 20 to 26. Later that same day, however, Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka said that the cabinet would not discuss the proposal in that week. According to him, negotiations with representatives of the opposition, unions and employers should first take place and only then should the proposal be sent to the commenting office. Only then should the government discuss possible changes to the valorization.</p><p> A similar situation occurred in the case of the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs that the government would approve the adjustment of valorizations at the beginning of April. Marian Jurečka actually wrote on Twitter under Alena Schillerová&#39;s post that the proposal would first be discussed with the opposition and other partners. For these reasons, we assess the statement as true.</p>
