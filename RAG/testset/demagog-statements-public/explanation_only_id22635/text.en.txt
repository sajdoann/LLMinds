<p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka already <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/ekonomika-jurecka-duchodovy-vek-bude-podle-profese-a-vzdelani-40422115">mentioned</a> in February that nothing would change for people born before 1973 as part of <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3564561-dnesni-tricatniky-ceka-penze-v-68-letech-ukazuje-interni-dokument-ministerstva-prace">the planned</a> pension <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3455032-vlada-chysta-zmenu-duchodoveho-systemu-navrhuje-drivejsi-penzi-u-narocnych-profesi">reform</a> . A few days later, Minister Jurečka also <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3565087-posun-duchodoveho-veku-nad-65-let-se-podle-fialy-tykal-tech-kdo-pujdou-do-penze-za">spoke out</a> towards younger generations: <i>&quot;If we continued and did nothing like our predecessors did, young people simply would not have a decent pension.&quot;</i></p><p> Similarly, Prime Minister Petr Fiala <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3565087-posun-duchodoveho-veku-nad-65-let-se-podle-fialy-tykal-tech-kdo-pujdou-do-penze-za">spoke</a> to Czech Television in February, specifically talking about <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/duchod-odchod-68-let-cesi-penze-vek-duchodci_2302122005_ula">a possible</a> postponement of retirement: <i>&quot;It cannot apply to people who are about to retire. That is out of the question. (…) It would have to be long-term – for people who will retire in twenty or thirty years.&quot;</i></p><p> The Minister of Finance Zbyněk Stanjura (ODS) also spoke about the pension reform on the ČT24 program Interview, back in January, when he specifically <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3558744-vlada-lidem-penize-nedava-jen-jim-bere-mene-rika-stanjura">said</a> (video, time 27:57): <i>&quot;It will probably not, a possible change in the rules, affect people who have a few years until retirement, because (...) they will not be given enough time to, for example, change their behavior, for example, save more. It will primarily affect the generation of about 50 minus, maybe 45 minus.&quot;</i></p>
