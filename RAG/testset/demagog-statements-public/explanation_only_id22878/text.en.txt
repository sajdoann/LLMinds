<p>The Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) is talking about the length of processing applications for housing allowance, not the time period between processing the application and payment of the allowance – the editor is asking about the system of granting social benefits, not about their payment. Jurečka, with his words <i>“we pay housing allowance within the deadlines set by law”</i> , clearly points out that timely processing of the application helps to pay the allowance for the retroactively recognised period within the deadline set by law. However, he then refers the mentioned number of days to the length of the procedure itself. Let us note that the deadline for processing an application for housing allowance is <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p71-3">30 days</a> according to the Administrative Code, or up to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p71-3-a">60 days</a> if it is a complex case or if the Labour Office has to <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/socialni-davky-prispevek-na-bydleni-zpozdeni-urad-prace-jurecka_2303291008_ako">conduct</a> a social investigation ( <a href="https://www.ochrance.cz/letaky/rizeni-o-davkach-pomoci-v-hn/rizeni-o-davkach-pomoci-v-hn.pdf">.pdf</a> , p. 2).</p><p> We could not find any statistics in publicly available sources that would discuss the length of processing an application for housing allowance. We therefore asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MLSA) to send us the data that Minister Jurečka draws on in his statement. We subsequently received a graph with internal data from the MLSA, which documents the average processing time for applications for housing allowance within the individual regional directorates of the Labour Office in the period from June 1 to July 28 of this year.</p><p> However, the average processing time does not in itself exclude the possibility that in individual cases applications could be processed beyond the legally prescribed deadline. Likewise, the graph did not in any way support Minister Jurečka&#39;s claim that <i>&quot;in 98 percent of cases</i> (application processing takes around the 30-day mark, note: Demagog.cz) <i>it is only because we have asked the client to deliver something to us, and he has not yet provided us with the requested document or information.&quot;</i></p><p> We therefore contacted the Ministry again with a request for statistics on all cases where the deadline was met and when it was not, as well as for supporting the claim about the reasons for the time limit for processing applications for the allowance in Prague. However, we have not received another response, and we therefore consider the statement to be unverifiable.</p>
