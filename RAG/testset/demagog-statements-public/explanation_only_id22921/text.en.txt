<p>With this statement, Minister of the Interior Vít Rakušan is responding to <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22915">the words of</a> Tomi Okamura, who spoke about the crime of foreigners and mentioned that last year the most offenses committed by foreigners were committed by Ukrainian citizens. In his response, the Austrian stated that with <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22920">the increase</a> in the number of Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, it is logical that <i>&quot;criminal activity is also increasing in this group.&quot;</i> In the statement we verified, he illustrates that the increase in crime committed by foreigners does not correspond to the overall increase in foreigners living in the Czech Republic.</p><p> <strong>Number of foreigners</strong> <strong>in the Czech Republic</strong></p><p> According to the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO), in 2020, a total of 10,701,777 people lived in the Czech Republic ( <a href="https://www.czso.cz/documents/11350/121768518/oby032221.xlsx/a8c817b5-693f-4cbd-8462-ca838eaed251?version=1.0">.xlsx</a> ). This number <a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/pocet_obyvatel_m">includes</a> both citizens of the Czech Republic and foreigners. The annual report of the Ministry of the Interior on the state of public administration states that 634,790 foreigners resided in the Czech Republic at the end of the year ( <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/vyrocni-zprava-o-stavu-verejne-spravy-v-cr-v-r-2020.aspx">.pdf</a> , p. 34). The representation of foreigners in society at the end of 2020 was approximately 5.9% ( <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/migrace/soubor/zprava-o-situaci-v-oblasti-migrace-a-integrace-cizincu-na-uzemi-ceske-republiky-v-roce-2021.aspx">.pdf</a> , p. 77).</p><p> The latest population data <a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/pohyb-obyvatelstva-1-ctvrtleti-2023">was published</a> by the Czech Statistical Office as of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230901124029/https:/www.czso.cz/csu/czso/obyvatelstvo_lide">March 31,</a> 2023, when the republic had 10,850,620 inhabitants. According to the Ministry of the Interior, on the same date, a total of 1,010,692 persons of foreign nationality were registered ( <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/migrace/soubor/ctvrtletni-zpravy-o-situaci-v-oblasti-migrace-dokumenty-ctvrtletni-zprava-o-migraci-i-2023.aspx">.pdf</a> , p. 1), and the share of foreigners was therefore 9.3%. For the sake of completeness, let us add that according to later published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230914150552/https:/www.czso.cz/csu/czso/obyvatelstvo_lide">data</a> at the end of June, this share reached 9.5% ( <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/zpravy-o-migraci-ctvrtletni-zprava-o-migraci-ii-2023.aspx">.pdf</a> , p. 1).</p><p> Vít Rakušan does not provide completely accurate figures for 2020 and 2023, especially regarding the share of foreigners in the total population of the Czech Republic, but he is right that the number of foreigners has roughly doubled. In terms of percentage, at the end of March 2023, the proportion of foreigners in the population increased by 3.4 percentage points compared to 2020. </p><figure class="embed"><iframe style="border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;" data-external="1" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/O5jxd/4/" id="datawrapper-chart-O5jxd" aria-label="Column Chart" title="Population development of the Czech Republic"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> Sources: Czech Statistical <a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/pohyb-obyvatelstva-1-ctvrtleti-2023">Office</a> ( <a href="https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/191186709/1300702303.xlsx/91ca700f-150f-44ff-80a2-f8f8de53cce2?version=1.1">.xlsx</a> ), Ministry of the Interior ( <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/vystupy-a-souvisejici-vyrocni-zprava-o-stavu-verejne-spravy-v-cr-v-r-2022.aspx">.pdf</a> , p. 37; <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/migrace/soubor/ctvrtletni-zpravy-o-situaci-v-oblasti-migrace-dokumenty-ctvrtletni-zprava-o-migraci-i-2023.aspx">.pdf</a> , p. 1).</p><p> <strong>Criminal activity of foreigners</strong></p><p> Statistical overviews of criminal activity are regularly <a href="https://www.policie.cz/statistiky-kriminalita.aspx">published</a> by the Police of the Czech Republic. To calculate the share of foreigners in criminal activity, we use two pieces of data – the number of <a href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/statisticke-prehledy-kriminality-za-rok-2023.aspx">solved</a> crimes, i.e. those where the initiation and completion of criminal proceedings occurred in the same year. The second piece of data is the number of acts committed by foreigners out of these solved crimes ( <a href="https://www.policie.cz/soubor/2023-06-cerven-sest-01a-xlsx.aspx">.xlsx</a> ).</p><p> Statistics for 2020 ( <a href="https://www.policie.cz/soubor/2020-12-prosinec-sest-01a-xlsx.aspx">.xlsx</a> ) indicate that the police recorded a total of 6,350 crimes committed by foreigners in that year, while the total number of solved crimes reached 77,786. Foreigners were thus responsible for approximately 8.2% of crimes in 2020 for which the police identified the perpetrators.</p><p> So far, the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230829200433/https:/www.policie.cz/clanek/statisticke-prehledy-kriminality-za-rok-2023.aspx">police</a> <a href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/statisticke-prehledy-kriminality-za-rok-2023.aspx">statistics</a> of the criminal activity overview ( <a href="https://www.policie.cz/soubor/2023-06-cerven-sest-01a-xlsx.aspx">.xlsx</a> ) cover the period from the beginning of January to the end of June 2023. It states that a total of 4,151 crimes were committed during this period, of which foreigners were accused. The total number of solved crimes was 38,233. Thus, in the first half of 2023, foreigners were responsible for approximately 10.9% of solved crimes. Compared to 2022, this share increased by approximately 2.7 percentage points. </p><figure class="embed"><iframe style="border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;" data-external="1" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/32TJe/6/" id="datawrapper-chart-32TJe" aria-label="Column Chart" title="Development of crime in the Czech Republic"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> In 2020, the share of foreigners in the population was 5.9%, and as of March 31 this year it was 9.3%. According to data from the Police of the Czech Republic, foreigners participated in criminal activity by 8.2% in 2020, while in the first half of 2023 by 10.9%.</p><p> The Minister of the Interior therefore provides slightly inaccurate data, but compared to the actual data, most of it is still within the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=avast-a-2&amp;q=10+%25+odchylka+demagog&amp;oq=10+%25+odchylka+demagog&amp;aqs=avast..69i57.7102j0j1&amp;ie=UTF-8">10%</a> deviation we tolerate. Only the share of foreigners in the Czech population mentioned by the Austrian (in whose case the deviation reaches 18%) did not fit into it.</p><p> Based on these data, the Austrian&#39;s conclusion that the increase in the number of foreigners (by 3.4 pp) does not correspond to the increase in the share of foreigners in criminal activity (by 2.7 pp) can also be considered correct.</p><p> For the reasons stated, we assess Vít Rakušan&#39;s statement as true, but due to slightly inaccurate data, as true with reservations.</p>
