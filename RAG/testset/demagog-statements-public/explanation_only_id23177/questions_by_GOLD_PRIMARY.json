    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: And I already said in my first post-election speech, let&#39;s overcome those differences, we respect, of course, that we have different political opinions, we vote for different parties, we have different ideas about what the level of taxes should be, and so on, but we are all citizens of the Czech Republic, we have to live together here as neighbors, as collaborators.\nSECTION B: Economists say that about half of it (inflation, note: Demagog.cz) is caused by international influences. But - and this is important and both independent economists and, for example, the Czech National Bank agree on this - half of it is due to the poor management of our state and the way the previous government managed its finances.\nSECTION C: The proposal (of the budget for next year, note: Demagog.cz) of the Ministry of Finance counted on a deficit of 235 billion crowns, it was not a government proposal, but it was a calculation of some parameters, then we stipulated within the budget framework that the budget deficit for next year must not exceed 270 billion. (...) In the end, we agreed on a deficit of 252 billion for next year.\nSECTION D: And as Prime Minister, I think, on December 22nd, I sent a letter on behalf of the Czech Republic to the President of the European Commission, where I say: our government considers the core to be extremely important, I ask you to take this into account when making decisions, and here I am attaching the decision of our Parliament, which shows that this is what the Czech Republic wants across the political spectrum.\nSECTION E: I was also at school that day (the day of the trade union strike, note: Demagog.cz) (...) and I spoke with both teachers and students (...). I also visited an agricultural enterprise, which coincidentally, as one of the managers, not the owners, the proprietors, (...) one of the leading representatives or management was Mr. Jurečka&#39;s brother.\nSECTION F: I would like to recall the statements of the former Minister of Finance, Mrs. Schillerová, from the spring of last year, when she said that the path to budget consolidation lies, among other things, in not valorizing, not increasing the salaries of employees in the state sector. And that only the salaries of teachers, firefighters, police officers, and so on will increase. And that is exactly what we did.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
