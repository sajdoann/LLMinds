    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: We pay the housing allowance within the deadlines set by law. For most regions, we are between 15 and 21 days. In Prague, we are at the limit of around 30 days. And in 98 percent of cases, this is only because we have asked the client to deliver something to us, and he has not yet provided us with the requested document or information.\nSECTION B: We said that with the pension reform we want to ensure, firstly, that we guarantee decent pensions for the generation of people in their forties, thirties and younger people, also in the future, that there is a fair system, that it is sustainable, that nothing fundamental will change for current pensioners and people of pre-retirement age who are 50 plus.\nSECTION C: The Czech Statistical Office – a demographic report produced by experts – tells us after five years that the situation from the perspective of the pension system is worse than five years ago. (…) We will live to an even older age, the number of people of productive age will decrease, and our birth rate will stabilize somewhere around 1.5.\nSECTION D: On Friday (March 17, 2023, note: Demagog.cz), information appeared that was not from me, I immediately responded to it, I denied that I would not submit an amendment to this law (regulating the valorization mechanism, note: Demagog.cz) to the government either this week or next week until negotiations with social partners, with the opposition, and until I had completed the proper interdepartmental comment procedure. (...) Yesterday I also wrote this clearly under the account of the Chairwoman Alena Schillerová on Twitter.\nSECTION E: If you look at the press conference recording (after the government meeting on April 27, note: Demagog.cz), I leaned over to the Prime Minister and asked if it was pure or crude. He himself wasn&#39;t entirely sure. I said pure. (...) it was my mistake, I apologized for it, I set it straight.\nSECTION F: In the past, there have been judgments where the Constitutional Court stated that, for example, it found some doubts about the legislative process, but did not change the substance, or said that the substance had some defects from the Constitutional Court&#39;s perspective, but gave a deadline or said how it would see the correction.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
