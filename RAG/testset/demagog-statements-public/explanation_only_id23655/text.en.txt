<p>In the context of the statement, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) describes the demographic development and changes in the behavior of Czech society, which, according to him, necessitate a pension reform and an increase in the retirement age ( <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1096898594-udalosti-komentare/224411000371030/">video</a> , time: 22:50). According to Jurečka, a recent projection by demographers shows, for example, that the number of people of working age who <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/myty-fakta-duchody#:~:text=FAKT%3A%20LID%C3%89%20V,na%20d%C5%AFchodov%C3%A9%20poji%C5%A1t%C4%9Bn%C3%AD">finance</a> the pension system through pension contributions will decrease. In this context, Jurečka also claims that the latest projection assumes even worse development than the projections from previous years.</p><p> <strong>Demographic projection of the Czech Statistical Office</strong></p><p> The Czech Statistical Office (CZSO) publishes a demographic projection every five years ( <a href="https://www.rozpoctovarada.cz/ke-stazeni/informacni-studie-alternativni-demograficke-projekce/">.pdf</a> , p. 3). <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/projekce-obyvatelstva-ceske-republiky-2023-2100">The last</a> projection was published in 2023, the previous one in <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/projekce-obyvatelstva-ceske-republiky-2018-2100">2018.</a> This task <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1991-582#p10b-1">is assigned</a> to it by the Act on the Organization and Implementation of Social Security. The projection is intended to include the expected development of mortality, fertility and migration in the Czech Republic.</p><p> The Czech Statistical Office processes population projections in three variants – medium, low and high ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 1). These variants differ mainly in the projected number of the Czech Republic&#39;s population – in the medium variant it is stable, in the high variant it is growing, in the low variant it is decreasing ( <a href="https://www.rozpoctovarada.cz/ke-stazeni/informacni-studie-alternativni-demograficke-projekce/">.pdf</a> , p. 3). The authors of the Czech Statistical Office studies state that the medium variant represents the most likely scenario for future population development ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 1). We will therefore base our assessment of Marian Jurečka&#39;s statement on data from this medium variant, comparing data from projections from 2018 and 2023.</p><p> <strong>Life expectancy</strong></p><p> Life expectancy at birth is <a href="https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Nad%C4%9Bje_do%C5%BEit%C3%AD">an indicator of</a> life expectancy, which indicates the average age a child born in a given generation will live to. Marian Jurečka claims that <i>&quot;we will live to an even older age&quot;,</i> meaning that life expectancy will increase.</p><p> According to the latest projection by the Czech Statistical Office, life expectancy in the Czech Republic has actually been increasing since 1989, with the exception of higher mortality in 2020–2022 associated with the Covid-19 pandemic ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 5). Although this increase has been slowing down over the years, between 2023 and 2050, life expectancy should increase by 5.2 years to 82.2 years for men and by 4.1 years to 87.1 years for women ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 6). In contrast, the projection from 2018 ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 4) assumed a slower increase in expected life expectancy. However, as the following table shows, the older projection does not fundamentally differ from the newer one, especially in the case of data for the period of the next approximately 35 years. </p><figure class="embed"><iframe style="border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;" data-external="1" height="430" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1ylDB/6/" id="datawrapper-chart-1ylDB" aria-label="Interactive line chart" title="Life expectancy of men and women (CZSO projections 2018 and 2023)"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> <strong>Number of people of working age</strong></p><p> The productive component of the population is the age <a href="https://ghostarchive.org/archive/sI84D">group</a> between 15 and 64. From 2009 to 2021, its share in the population decreased, but with the arrival of refugees in 2022 it strengthened. The latest projection of the Czech Statistical Office predicted an increase for 2023 and 2024 ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 13).</p><p> The working-age population is projected to begin declining in the mid-1930s ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 14). By the end of the 2050s, it should fall to 6 million from the current 6.87 million. By the end of the century, according to the mid-range demographic projection from 2023, the number of working-age people will decrease to 5.39 million ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 14).</p><p> In addition to these numbers, the projections also indicate the share of the working-age population in the total population ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 11, <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 14). This value is crucial for the state of the pension system, as it shows how large a part of society will be able <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/myty-fakta-duchody#:~:text=FAKT%3A%20LID%C3%89%20V,na%20d%C5%AFchodov%C3%A9%20poji%C5%A1t%C4%9Bn%C3%AD">to earn</a> on pensions. The projections from 2018 ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 11) and 2023 ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 14) assume that the share of the working-age population will decline, especially in the next 40 years, but the individual documents mention slightly different figures.</p><p> As can be seen in the graph below, for the period 2031–2071, the newer projection shows a higher share of the population of working age than the previous CZSO projection. <i>&quot;From the perspective of the pension system&quot;</i> , which Marian Jurečka is talking about, the newer projection for the next 50 years shows better results than the projection from 2018. The new projection assumes worse numbers compared to the older one only in the years 2081–2101. </p><figure class="embed"><iframe style="border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;" data-external="1" height="379" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NoOr3/1/" id="datawrapper-chart-NoOr3" aria-label="Interactive line chart" title="Proportion of working-age population"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> <strong>Birth rate, fertility</strong></p><p> The birth rate <a href="https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~mak/gos/demmetodika/www.czso.cz/cz/cisla/0/02/020100/narozeni.htm#:~:text=Po%C4%8Det%20%C5%BEiv%C4%9B%20narozen%C3%BDch%20d%C4%9Bt%C3%AD%2C%20p%C5%99ipadaj%C3%ADc%C3%AD%20na%201000%20obyvatel%20st%C5%99edn%C3%ADho%20stavu.">indicates</a> the number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants. The fertility rate makes this figure <a href="https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Porodnost">more precise</a> by expressing the number of these children per thousand women of reproductive age. Statistics also calculate it directly by age (e.g. for women aged 20, 21, etc.). The sum of fertility rates for all age groups (divided by a thousand) expresses the intensity of fertility in the population and indicates the average number of live births per woman, the so-called total fertility.</p><p> Total fertility is an indicator that is <a href="https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Porodnost">suitable</a> , for example, for international comparison. A value of 2.1 children per woman is generally considered sufficient to prevent population decline. If the value falls below 2.1, the population decreases in the long term, and vice versa. In his statement, Marian Jurečka is clearly confusing the terms total fertility and birth rate. According to the latest data from the Czech Statistical Office, the birth rate in 2023 reached about 8.4 per thousand ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/d5c66500-c681-32b9-907d-4158ccceefb9/13006924.pdf?version=1.1">.pdf</a> , pp. 5, 36). This is therefore a completely different figure than the one Minister Jurečka is talking about.</p><p> According to CZSO data, fertility fell significantly in the 1990s, then rose again in the first two decades of the 21st century ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 2) and remained at 1.71 between 2018 and 2020. A year later, it even increased to 1.83. Then, however, there was a decline - in 2022 to 1.62 and in 2023 to <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/narozeni?pocet=10&amp;start=0&amp;podskupiny=133&amp;razeni=-datumVydani">1.45 children</a> per woman.</p><p> The CZSO projection from November 2023, based on the current data at that time, estimated that the total fertility rate for 2023 would be 1.5 children per woman ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 2). In the middle, most likely variant of the CZSO projection, the CZSO assumes that fertility will reach the same value in the following years (p. 3). In contrast, the previous projection from 2018 assumed a gradual stabilization at 1.74 children per woman ( <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a> , p. 2).</p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) summarizes the conclusions of the Czech Statistical Office regarding the three aforementioned indicators – life expectancy, the number of people of working age and total fertility, which he confuses with the term <i>“birth rate”</i> . He correctly states that according to the Czech Statistical Office’s projection from 2023, life expectancy will increase, the number of people of working age will decrease and total fertility will stabilize at 1.5 children per woman.</p><p> In the statement, however, it primarily compares the CZSO projections from 2023 and 2018 and says that the newer document assumes worse results <i>&quot;from the perspective of the pension system&quot;</i> than the previous estimates. Compared to the older one, the newest projection does indeed assume a faster decline in the fertility rate and a slightly higher increase in life expectancy. In the key category of the share of the population in the working age group, however, the 2023 projection shows worse results only for the last 20 years of this century, while for the years 2031–2071 (i.e. for the next 50 years) it assumes better development than the older projection. We therefore assess the statement as misleading.</p>
