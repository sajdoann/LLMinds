statement:
And I already said in my first post-election speech, let's overcome those differences, we respect of course that we have different political opinions, we vote for different parties, we have different ideas about what the level of taxes should be and so on, but we are all citizens of the Czech Republic, we have to live together here as neighbors, as collaborators. additional context: <p>Petr Fiala answered the <a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030501017/#t=48m28s">question</a> (video, time 48:28), which mentioned that more than a million voters lost their votes in the parliamentary elections, who are thus not represented in the Chamber of Deputies. Petr Fiala stated (time 49:22) that <i>"good government governs for everyone, even for those who did not vote for it"</i>. He then illustrates this position by referring to his older statement from the election staff, which is the content of the verified statement.</p><p>Petr Fiala made his first post-election speech in the election staff of the SPOLU coalition on October 9, when he <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3383514-zmeny-je-tady-my-jsme-ji-slibili-my-ji-udelame-rekl-lidr-spolu-fiala">said</a> (video, time 1:52): <i>“(…) I would like to ask you something in this context. All of you who are watching us. It doesn’t matter who you voted for, it doesn’t matter what your political preferences are. First and foremost, we are all citizens of the Czech Republic who want to live here and we want to live here together, as neighbors, as friends, as colleagues. That is what unites us all".</i></p><p>Let us add that the SPOLU coalition <a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps124?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xkraj=0&amp;xstrana=13&amp;xv=1">formed</a> by ODS, TOP 09 and&nbsp;KDU-ČSL won <a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps2?xjazyk=CZ">27.79&nbsp;%</a> of the votes in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, and thus finished first.</p>
