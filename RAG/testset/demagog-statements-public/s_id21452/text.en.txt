statement:(...) a proposal that I have repeatedly expressed in my speeches on the budget in the Chamber of Deputies. This proposal consists of the abolition of tax exemptions. If all tax exemptions were abolished, I said that it would save 380 billion crowns. Which is almost as much as the estimated state budget deficit this year. additional context:
<p>Miloš Zeman spoke about the need to abolish tax exemptions in the Chamber of Deputies in <a href="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/035schuz/s035223.htm">2019</a>, and a year later in his budget speech at the <a href="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/062schuz/index.htm">62nd meeting</a> of the Chamber of Deputies <a href="https://www.hrad.cz/cs/prezident-cr/soucasny-prezident-cr/vybrane-projevy-a-rozhovory/projev-prezidenta-republiky-pri-62.-schuzi-poslanecke-snemovny-15653">said</a>: <i>"We calculated with Minister Schillerová that the abolition of tax exemptions and reliefs would represent 380 billion crowns." </i>However, it is not certain how these 380 billion were calculated, because the former Minister of Finance Alena Schillerová herself later mentioned 300 billion in an interview on Czech Television, <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3310573-schillerova-vidi-cestu-z-krize-v-investicich-dle-wagenknecht-a-zamrazilove-se">300 billion in a second interview. </a>In the interview, she spoke about 330 billion.</p><p>In addition to the minister's words, the last official calculation of tax reliefs is from 2018, when, according to <a href="https://www.kurzy.cz/zpravy/597053-muze-ceskou-verejnou-kasu-zachranit-zruseni-danovych-vyjimek/">estimates</a> of the Ministry of Finance (MF), the total value was over 500 billion crowns. The total tax relief is calculated from tax reliefs for personal income tax, corporate income tax and value added tax. According to the <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=20996">document</a> (.pdf, p.&nbsp;1) Quantification of Tax Reliefs in the Czech Republic for 2018, which was published as an appendix to the Fiscal Outlook of the Ministry of Finance, total tax reliefs in 2018 amounted to <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=20996">520&nbsp;billion&nbsp;CZK</a> (.pdf, p.&nbsp;5).</p><p>However, there is <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=20996">no uniform methodology for calculating these reliefs</a> (.pdf, p.&nbsp;1) and there are no other restrictive rules for the form of the analysis of tax reliefs. The difference in the estimate of the Ministry of Finance and Alena Schillerová may therefore be caused by a different methodology.</p><p>According to the State Budget Act, the state budget deficit should be <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2020-600#p1-1">500&nbsp;billion</a> crowns this year, but this plan is unlikely to be fulfilled. At the end of November, the state budget ended with a deficit of 401.5&nbsp;billion crowns, and it can be assumed that the resulting deficit for 2021 will not be much higher. The mentioned 380 billion actually almost reaches this year's estimated deficit.</p><p>Miloš Zeman is therefore correct in stating that he spoke about tax exemptions in the past in the Chamber of Deputies and even mentioned the amount of 380 billion crowns at that time. This sum does not correspond to the estimates of the former Minister of Finance or the estimates of the Ministry of Finance from 2018. Although they differ significantly, Miloš Zeman's 380 billion moves between these estimates, which also do not have a uniform methodology. We therefore assess his statement as true with reservations.</p><p>For context, let us add that <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/assets/cs/media/Dane_Zprava_2014_o-danovych-ulevach-v-Ceske-republice-za-roky-2011-2015.pdf">tax relief</a> represents a measure (.pdf, p.&nbsp;5), which is an advantage for the taxpayer in the form of lower or later tax paid compared to the situation where such a measure would not be included in the law. The reason for introducing a tax relief may be to support other public policies (for example, reducing taxes for taxpayers whose economic activity the state wants to support), to achieve greater efficiency of the tax system (for example, exempting taxpayers with relatively low or zero incomes), or a combination of both.</p><p>Tax relief includes, for example, tax exemptions, items reducing the tax base, items reducing the tax, reduced tax rates, etc. More specifically, for personal income tax, items exempt from tax include, for example, income in the form of awards in the <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-586#p4-1-f">field of culture</a>, income in the form of <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-586#p4-1-k">scholarships</a> from the state budget or from university funds.</p>
