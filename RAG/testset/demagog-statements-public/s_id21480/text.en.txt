statement: Economists say that roughly half of it (inflation, note: Demagog.cz) is caused by international influences. But - and this is important and both independent economists and the Czech National Bank agree on this - half of it is due to the poor management of our state and the way the previous government managed its finances. additional context: <p>Petr Fiala talks about the ratio of international and domestic influences that contribute to the increase in inflation. No studies that would precisely determine how individual components contribute to inflation growth have apparently been conducted (video, 9:02). Economists such as Jan Švejnar (video, 0:46) and href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030500912/">Štěpán Jurajda</a> (video, 8:57) for example, disruption of import chains, i.e. delays or shortages of certain raw materials. Some input raw materials may also become more expensive, the main ones recently being <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/energy-chaos-adds-to-inflation-angst-for-europe-s-policy-makers?sref=qI83munY">energy</a>, <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3379052-kremikove-trzni-peklo-zdrazil-o-tri-sta-procent-a-do-problemu-dostal-mnoho-odvetvi">silicon</a>, <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3383072-kvuli-nedostatku-cipu-automobilky-prijdou-o-biliony-korun-nedodelana-auta-stoji">chips</a> or <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/zdrazovani-materialu-cesko-ceny-stavba-rekonstrukce_2111021338_ern">construction materials</a>, such as <a href="https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/">wood</a> (video, 3:08).

That is why this type of inflation is called <a href="https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/">supply-side inflation</a> (video, 3:08), which is caused by an increase in the prices of inputs to production.</p><p>As for the domestic influences that contribute to this wave of rising inflation, we can mention, for example, the words of the head of the National Budget Council <a href="https://echo24.cz/a/Sx5mc/ceka-nas-to-nejhorsi-ekonomove-reaguji-na-tvrdy-boj-cnb-s-inflaci">Eva Zamrazilová:</a> <i>"The connection between inflation and the legacy of the previous fiscal policy is obvious, after all, we have repeatedly pointed out this fact. The problem of inflation certainly cannot be brushed off the table by saying that it is purely global imported inflation.”</i></p><p>For example, economist <a href="https://forbes.cz/horska-hleda-se-vinik-inflace-jen-globalni-problemy-za-ni-nemohou/">Helena Horská</a> speaks about the government's influence on price increases. She states that when the economy reopens, most restaurateurs, hoteliers and service providers in general will increase their prices to compensate for losses from the lockdown period and to meet increased deferred demand. He also adds: <i>"This demand is being inflated by other factors. Specifically, the abolition of the super-gross wage, the increase in pensions beyond the framework of valorization, the abolition of the property acquisition tax, and other steps that have loosened budgetary discipline so much that even after the pandemic subsides, the state treasury is expected to be short of almost 400 billion crowns during a time of economic boom." </i>However, Helena Horská does not see government policy as the main cause of inflation.</p><p>A short quote by <a href="https://www.e15.cz/volby/volby-do-snemovny/vlada-je-spoluviniklem-inflace-zbytecne-utraci-dluh-statu-rychle-roste-a-je-stale-drazsi-1383895">Petr Kříž</a> in the E15 daily newspaper refers exclusively to government influences, which include high state budget deficits or rising pensions. However, such statements are exceptions. According to the rest of the article and the other economists cited here, however, government policy is not the main culprit for the current inflation. The CNB sees the cause of the current high inflation <a href="https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/komentare-cnb-ke-zverejnenym-statistickym-udajum-o-inflaci-a-hdp/Inflace-v-zari-2021-vysoko-nad-prognozou-CNB-a-horni-hranici-tolerancniho-pasma-cile/">in something else</a> than "poor state management". According to her, one of the main reasons is <i>"a surge in consumer demand after the lifting of anti-epidemic measures", </i> which leads to a sharp increase in prices in the services sector, while at the same time the growth in prices of goods has accelerated, as <a href="https://forbes.cz/horska-hleda-se-vinik-inflace-jen-globalni-problemy-za-ni-nemohou/">also stated</a> by Helena Horská. However, according to the CNB, this effect also occurs in other countries. The CNB <a href="https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/komentare-cnb-ke-zverejnenym-statistickym-udajum-o-inflaci-a-hdp/Inflace-v-zari-2021-vysoko-nad-prognozou-CNB-a-horni-hranici-tolerancniho-pasma-cile/">identified</a> as another significant cause of inflation: "<i>the high growth of industrial producer prices in the world due to disruptions in supply chains, to which is added a significant increase in the price of many raw materials and materials".</i> At the end of its commentary, the CNB writes about <i>"unexpectedly strong and widespread inflationary pressures from the domestic and foreign economies"</i>. The fact that the government's budgetary policy is at least partly causing today's inflation level was previously <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/cnb-prekvapila-uroky-vyskocily-na-150-175938">pointed out</a> by CNB Governor Rusnok. On the other hand, CNB Councilor Aleš Michl <a href="https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/autorske-clanky-rozhovory-s-predstaviteli-cnb/Nesmysly-o-inflaci/">stated</a> that the government <i>"cannot really be held responsible"</i> for inflation.</p><p>In his statement, Petr Fiala emphasizes that economists and the CNB attribute equal credit for rising inflation to international factors and the previous government's economic management. The statements of some economists may be in line with the Prime Minister's statement, although this is clearly a minority position. However, the published positions of representatives of the Czech National Bank are completely inconsistent with the Prime Minister's statement - the CNB attributes the main responsibility for the increase in inflation to international influences. We therefore assess Fiala's statement as false.</p><p>Let us add that in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/0/2-17122021-AP-EN.pdf/ebf0659e-db3c-fc20-9faa-e74964b1827d">November</a> (.pdf) 2021, the inflation rate in the Czech Republic was below the European Union average, at 4.8 percent. Finally, let us also state that we have already verified Petr Fiala's <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/21147">statements</a> about&nbsp;<a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/21233">inflation</a> in the past.</p>
