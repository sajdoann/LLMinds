statement: The mechanism (increase in pensions, note: Demagog.cz) is given by law (...), if since the last month taken for the valorization of pensions, which took place from January, which is July last year, inflation increases by more than 5% in total, then pensions are automatically valorized and are valorized according to the level of inflation in the last month in which the cumulative increase of over 5% occurred.

additional context: <p>In his statement, Minister Jurečka describes the mechanism of extraordinary pension valorization, which, according to the Pension Insurance Act, is used in the event of rapidly <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155">increasing</a> inflation. <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3400504-cesko-smeruje-k-mimoradnemu-zvysovani-duchodu-kvuli-inflaci">growing</a> inflation. <p>The conditions for increasing pensions in an extraordinary period are specifically described in <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-3">§&nbsp;67</a>. According to him, extraordinary pension valorization is applied if the growth in the consumer price index reaches at least 5%. The merit part of the pension (i.e. the percentage of the pension) is then increased by the percentage by which prices have increased. The period for determining price increases always begins with the calendar month following the end of the period according to which pensions were last valorized. With the <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-4-a">regular date</a> of valorization, price growth is monitored until the end of June of the previous year (with the regular date in 2022, this would be the end of June 2021). In the case of <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-4-b">extraordinary valorization</a>, however, the assessed period is shortened and ends with the month "<i>in which the price increase reached at least 5%".</i> Let us specify that these 5% must be the sum of <i>"monthly</i> <a href="https://www.penize.cz/duchody/430759-dalsi-zvyseni- duchodu-mimoradna-valorizace-kvuli-inflaci"> <i>increases</i></a><i>inflation"</i> for the given period.</p><p>Pensions are always increased by <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-2">January 1st</a>. The last increase took place on <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/finance/vice-penez-do-kapes-duchodcu-i-zamestnancu-letosni-rok-je-fi/r~c15e50f06c8f11ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/">January 1st</a> 2022, depending on how the consumer price index increased by the end of <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/">June 2021 </a>(.pdf). The last month "which was taken for the valorization of pensions" was June, not July, which Marian Jurečka mentions in his statement. However, let us note that the period for determining price increases for further increases in pensions begins in July 2021.</p><p>The whole issue is also explained in the press release (<a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/">.pdf</a>) of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs of November 18, 2021. According to this report, pensions must be increased by government decree if the above conditions are met. The government must issue this within <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-16">50&nbsp;days</a> from the end of the month in which prices increased by at least 5&nbsp;%. If the estimates come true, according to the ministry, the increase in pensions should occur in June 2022 (.pdf). In January, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Eva Davidová, also spoke about the extraordinary valorization of pensions for the daily newspaper Právo: "We assume that in January to such a price increase that the cumulated inflation from July 2021 will exceed five percent and that a valorization will be carried out in an extraordinary period, which will include the entire price development until January 2022. </i>At the same time, <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/mimoradna-valorizace-penzi-snizi-tu-radnou-40384069">she added</a> that the regular valorization of pensions in 2023 will be lower than if the extraordinary valorization had not occurred, but overall both pension increases will reflect the overall price development.</p><p>As for the overall growth of the <a href="https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/cs/shortUrl?su=e730f7c1">consumer price index</a>, from July to November 2021 this value increased by <a href="https://www.penize.cz/duchody/430759-dalsi-zvyseni-duchodu-mimoradna-valorizace-kvuli-inflaci">3.1%</a>. In December, there was a month-on-month increase of <a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/indexy-spotrebitelskych-cen-inflace-prosinec-2021">0.4%</a>, bringing the total figure to 3.5%. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is probably counting on an even faster increase of at least 1.5% in January, to a total of 5%.</p><p>Let us add that the Ministry of Finance, in its January macroeconomic prediction <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2022/ekonomika-letos-poroste-o-31--prumerna-i-44286">expects</a> that during 2022 there will be a relatively sharp increase in the average inflation rate to 8.5%. In 2021, according to information from the Czech Statistical Office, it was <a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/indexy-spotrebitelskych-cen-inflace-prosinec-2021">3.8%</a>.</p><p>Given that Marian Jurečka describes the applicable rules for extraordinary valorization correctly, except for a minor time inaccuracy, we evaluate this statement as true.</p>
