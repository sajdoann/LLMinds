statement: So the assistance tools (compensation for entrepreneurs, note: Demagog.cz) are shared here today mainly by 3 ministries, that is, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, for us it is the Antivirus programs (...), and then we also share the assistance tools with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Finance, where the other assistance tools for entrepreneurs and tradespeople are. additional context:<p>The former government <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-schvalila-podpurne-programy-pro-podnikatele-postizene-protiepidemickymi-opatrenimi-192462/">introduced</a> several programs to help employees, companies and&nbsp;self-employed persons (OSVČ) during the covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>As for the current <a href="https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace">compensation</a> programs, the Ministry of Labor and&nbsp;Social Affairs <a href="https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/informace-o-koronavirus/covid-dotacni-rozcestnik--259263/">includes</a>, for example, the <a href="https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompensace/antivirus-nucene-omezeni-provozu-karanteny">Antivirus&nbsp;A</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompensace/antivirus-b">Antivirus&nbsp;B</a>. The purpose of the first of these is <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-coronavirusu/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/"> compensation</a> of costs to employers whose employees were ordered to quarantine or isolate. In the case of Antiviru B, it was about <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-koronaviru/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/">compensation</a> for companies in the event that they had to limit operations due to a significant number of employees in quarantine, or, for example, if the demand for their services or products is limited due to the pandemic.</p><p>For damaged self-employed persons, but also for partners of small companies and persons working on DPČ and DPP, there is a program <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2021/od-22-listopadu-bude-pokracovat-kompenza-43629">Compensation bonus</a>, which <a href="https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/informace-o-koronavirus/covid-dotacni-rozcestnik--259263/">falls</a> under the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>The Ministry of Industry and Trade should have, for example, the <a href="https://www.mpo.cz/covid-2021">management</a> of the <a href="https://www.mpo.cz/covid-2021">COVID 2021</a> subsidy program and the <a href="https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-2021">COVID Uncovered Costs</a> program, <a href="https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/nova-podoba-kompensaci-k-programu-na-nepokryte-naklady-vlada-schvalila-take-program-covid---2021-s-podporou-500-kc-za-den-a-zamestnance---259983/">intended</a> for companies with&nbsp;a significant drop in sales. Although they were already prepared, the government ultimately decided not to <a href="https://www.podnikatel.cz/aktuality/firmy-maji-smulu-novy-ministr-odmitl-programy-covid-2021-a-nepokryte-naklady/">launch them again</a>.</p><p>Let us add that&nbsp;currently, there are also some programs whose purpose is primarily to provide entrepreneurs <a href="https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace">guarantees</a> for loans, however, these are not&nbsp;classical compensations. We can mention, for example, the <a href="https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/zaruka-covid-sport">COVID Sport</a> guarantee program under the Ministry of Industry and Trade. He was also responsible for the recently terminated guarantee program <a href="https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-zaruka-ck-prijem-zadosti-ukoncen">COVID Záruka CK</a> for travel agencies, which was followed by the <a href="https://www.nrb.cz/zaruky-cestovnim-kancelarim-bude-nrb-poskytovat-iv-roce-2022/">Záruka CK</a> program of the Ministry of Regional Development.</p><p>The above information shows that compensation programs are indeed divided primarily between the three mentioned ministries. We therefore assess Marian Jurečka's statement as true.</p>
