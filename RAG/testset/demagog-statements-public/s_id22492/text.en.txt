statement: That project (modifying the government's powers when sending soldiers abroad, note: Demagog.cz) still comes from our government and clearly states: if terrorists capture our people (...), we will send our anti-terrorist commando there, and no one will know, yes, but I fundamentally disagree with the government deciding without Parliament whether foreign soldiers will be here or whether we will send soldiers somewhere else. additional context:<p>Andrej Babiš reacts in the debate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dt4U64I-4K4?feature=share&amp;t=1443">to the moderator's question (video, time 24:03) whether he would support the government's <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3557390-zive-snemovna-schvaluje-zakon-proti-sireni-teroristickeho-obsahu-na-webu">proposal</a> to amend the Constitution, according to which the government<i>&nbsp;</i> could send soldiers abroad<i> "for example, to rescue Czech citizens"</i> without <a href="https://advokatnidenik.cz/2022/06/13/ministerstvo-obrany-predklada-vlade-upravu-vysilani-vojaku-do-zahranici/">prior</a> consent of Parliament (<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=213556">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;1). In his response, the chairman of the ANO movement stated that the proposal to change the rules of the government's powers came from "his government" and in connection with this proposal he only mentioned the case of rescuing Czechs abroad.</p><p>The currently under discussion draft amendment to the Constitution, which regulates the rules for sending Czech soldiers abroad and the passage of allied troops through the territory of the Czech Republic, was <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vojaci-ustava-vlada-zahranici-obrana-prelet-prejezd-novela-parlament-snemovna_2206221358_mst">submitted</a> by Petr Fiala's cabinet to the Chamber of Deputies <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=252">June 22, 2022.</a> According to this amendment, the government would no longer need the consent of Parliament. to&nbsp;permit the movement of foreign troops on the territory of the Czech Republic (<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=213558">.pdf</a>) or to&nbsp;send troops to foreign territory for the purpose of protecting <i>"life and&nbsp;health, threatening property values or the security of the Czech Republic"</i>(<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=213556">.pdf</a>, pp.&nbsp;1, 14), i.e. for example, in <a href="https://advokatnidenik.cz/2022/06/13/ministerstvo-obrany-predklada-vlade-upravu-vysilani-vojaku-do-zahranici/">rescuing</a> Czech citizens. However, this authority would still be limited to a period of 60 days, after which the presence of troops outside the Czech Republic would have to be approved by Parliament, just as it is now. The current proposal thus expands the range of defined cases in which the government can send troops outside Czech territory for a maximum of 60 days without prior parliamentary approval. According to the current <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl43-4">wording</a> of the Constitution, it can only make such a decision in three situations: when <i>"fulfilling obligations under&nbsp;international treaties on&nbsp;collective defense against attack"</i>, when participating in peacekeeping operations, and during rescue work after natural disasters or industrial and&nbsp;ecological accidents.</p><p>In the past, other proposals to modify the government's powers in&nbsp;this area were also submitted to the Chamber of Deputies (<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=213556">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;4). The first of these was filed during the government of <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2013-cr/bohuslav_sobotka/prehled-clenu-vlady-bohuslava-sobotky-29-01-2014---trva-124534/">Bohuslav Sobotka</a> in <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=7&amp;T=956">2016</a> by a group of deputies, including the then <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/martin-stropnicky-115391/">Minister</a> of Defense for the ANO movement <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/detail.sqw?o=7&amp;id=443">Martin Stropnický</a>. The second was a proposal from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=557&amp;sp=1">2019</a>, submitted by deputies from ODS, ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL and&nbsp;STAN. Among the proposers was the former <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2018-cr/andrej-babis-ii/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-27-6-2018-trva-175411/">prime minister</a> Andrej Babiš.</p><p>The aforementioned proposals from 2016 (<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=116747">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;16) and 2019 (<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=167115">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;22) proposed the following wording: The Constitution <a href="https://advokatnidenik.cz/2022/06/13/ministerstvo-obrany-predklada-vlade-upravu-vysilani-vojaku-do-zahranici/">remove</a> the above-mentioned three conditions under which the government can send soldiers abroad for a maximum of 60 days without the prior consent of Parliament.</p><p>Among the <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=116747">arguments</a> (.pdf, pp.&nbsp;2–3) for the introduction of this change, both proposals (in almost identical wording) stated that <i>"according to the current regulation, for example, it would be extremely difficult to send the armed forces of the Czech Republic in a timely manner to save the lives of Czech citizens illegally detained abroad"</i> (<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=167115">.pdf</a>, pp.&nbsp;3–4).</p><p>At the same time, however, these materials mentioned (<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=167115">.pdf</a>, pp.&nbsp;4–5) that the amendments were also necessary so that the Czech Republic could send units abroad within the framework of the so-called NATO Very Rapid Reaction Force (VJTF) even in cases that do not fall under <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl43-4">Article&nbsp;43(4)</a> of the Constitution without the consent of Parliament. That is, in situations beyond the scope of <i>"</i><a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl43-4-a"><i>fulfillment</i></a><i>of obligations under international treaties on mutual defense against attack"</i>.</p><p>The proposed changes were thus intended to enable the government <i>"to decide operationally on the deployment of the Czech Republic's armed forces outside the territory of the Czech Republic and on the stay of the armed forces of other states in the territory of the Czech Republic without specifying the purpose of the deployment or stay"</i> (<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=167115">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;18).</p><p>In conclusion, let us summarize that the adjustments to the government's powers when sending soldiers abroad are indeed MPs, including representatives of the ANO movement, proposed it when the ANO movement was part of the government and later when Andrej Babiš was prime minister. However, in his statement, the chairman of the ANO movement links the proposal for the rapid dispatch of Czech soldiers abroad without the prior consent of Parliament only to the situation of rescuing Czech citizens. At the same time, he does not add that the documents, one of which he himself <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=557&amp;sp=1">signed</a>, also proposed that the government could send the Czech Army abroad for 60 days without the consent of Parliament, and without any restrictions. For this reason, we assess his statement as misleading.</p>
