statement: We said that through the pension reform we want to ensure, firstly, that we guarantee decent pensions for the generation of people in their forties, thirties and younger people, even in the future, that there is a fair system, that it is sustainable, that nothing fundamental will change for current pensioners and people of pre-retirement age who are 50 plus. additional context: <p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka already mentioned in February <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/ekonomika-jurecka-duchodovy-vek-bude-podle-profese-a-vzdelani-40422115">that within the framework of <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3564561-dnesni-tricatniky-ceka-penze-v-68-letech-ukaže-interni-dokument-ministerstva-prace">planned</a> pension <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3455032-vlada-chysta-zmenu-duchodoveho-systemu-navrhhuje-drivejsi-penzi-u-narocnych-profesi">reformy</a> will not change anything for people born before 1973.&nbsp;A few days later, Minister Jurečka <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3565087-posun-duchodoveho-veku-nad-65-let-se-podle-fialy-tykal-tech-kdo-pujdou-do-penze-za">expressed</a> towards the younger generations: <i>"If we continued and did nothing like our predecessors did, young people simply would not have a decent pension."</i></p><p>Similarly, in February, Prime Minister Petr <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3565087-posun-duchodoveho-veku-nad-65-let-se-podle-fialy-tykal-tech-kdo-pujdou-do-penze-za">expressed</a> Fiala, who specifically spoke about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/duchod-odchod-68-let-cesi-penze-vek-duchodci_2302122005_ula">a possible</a> postponement of retirement: <i>"This cannot apply to people who are about to retire. That is out of the question. (…) It would have to be long-term – for people who will retire in twenty or thirty years.”</i></p><p>Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura (ODS) also spoke about the pension reform on the ČT24 program Interview, back in January, when he specifically <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3558744-vlada-lidem-penize-nedava-jen-jim-bere-mene-rika-stanjura">said</a> (video, time 27:57): <i>“It will probably not, a possible change in the rules, affect people who have a few years until retirement, because (…) they will not be given enough time to, for example, change their behavior, for example, save more. It will primarily affect the generation of about 50-minus, maybe 45-minus.”</i></p>
