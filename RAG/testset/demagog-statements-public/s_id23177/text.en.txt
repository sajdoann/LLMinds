statement: I was also at school that day (on the day of the trade union strike, note: Demagog.cz) (...) and I spoke with both teachers and students (...). I also visited an agricultural enterprise, which coincidentally, as one of the leaders, not the owners, the proprietors, (...) one of the leading representatives or management was Mr. Jurečka's brother. additional context: <p>Prime Minister Petr Fiala responds to the question of whether he plans to visit the regions in a similar way to what the Minister of the Interior Vít Rakušan is currently doing with his <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/rakusan-karvina/r~8775e82eb9bf11eebc030cc47ab5f122/">discussions</a> <i>"Without censorship"</i> or in the past <a href="https://karvinsky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/babis-tour-karvinsko-tesin-havirov-napadali-priznivci-odpurci2022.html">Andrej Babiš</a>. The Prime Minister states that he travels to smaller towns and villages regularly and cites as an example a visit to a school and an agricultural enterprise during a trade union strike in Prague.</p><p>The trade union strike took place on November 27, 2023 and was also reported as a school and teacher strike. In total, 74% of kindergartens, primary and secondary schools participated in the strike, with some of them remaining completely closed. In addition to the school unions, the civil service, timber and healthcare unions, for example, also declared a strike, and some companies also suspended operations. The main aim of the strike was to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231204205016/https:/www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2442475">promote</a> a higher budget for education, while some unions <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/clanek/domaci/jsme-pripraveni-pokracovat-v-protestech-rekl-stredula-na-odborarske-demonstraci-343569">protest</a> against the government's consolidation package. On the other hand, for example, the Teachers' Platform distanced itself from the unions' protest. On the day of the strike, Petr Fiala visited the Agro School in Pozdatin in the Třebíč region, where he arrived together with the Minister of Agriculture Marek Výborný (KDU-ČSL). At the school, they also met with teachers and students, with whom they debated. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=909295700559834&amp;set=pb.100044382371042.-2207520000">(<a href="https://www.idnes.cz/jihlava/zpravy/premier-fiala-ministr-zemedelstvi-vyborny-navsteva-skola-pozdatin.A231127_063333_jihlava-zpravy_mv/foto/V231127_122830_idnestv_jda">video</a>. href="https://www.idnes.cz/jihlava/zpravy/premier-fiala-ministr-zemedelstvi-vyborny-navsteva-skola-pozdatin.A231127_063333_jihlava-zpravy_mv#:~:text=Z%20Poz%C4%8Fat%C3%ADna%20premier%C3%A9r%20spole%C4%8Dn%C4%9B%20s%20V%C3%BDborn%C3%BDm%20zam%C5%99ili%20do%20Jihomoravsk%C3%A9ho%20kraje%2C%20konkr%C3%A9tn%C3%9B%20do%20Nov%C3%A9%20Vsi%20ned but%20Ivan%C4%8Dic%2C%20where%20is%20in%20pl%C3%A1nu%20setk%C3%A1n%C3%AD%20se%20zem%C4% 9Bd%C4%9Blci%20ze%20zem%C4%9Bd%C4%9Blsk%C3%A9ho%20dru%C5%BEstva%20Pooslav%C3%AD.%20Sv% The C5AFj%20pond%C4%9Bln%C3%AD%20program%20started%20in%20Brno%C4%9B%20where%20they%20met%20at%20Hotel%20International%20with%20novin%C3%A1%C5%99i.">Subsequently</a> <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/premier-petr-fiala-ministr-zemedelstvi-cesko-protest-navsteva.A231127_122709_domaci_vank">they visited</a> a meeting with farmers in the Pooslaví cooperative in&nbsp;Nová Ves.

According to Jakub Tomek from the Prime Minister's Communications Department, it was a regular working visit that was in no way related to the strike in the education sector. The Agro School did not participate in the protests, and normal classes were held there.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>On the day of the trade union strike, which took place on November 27, 2023, Petr Fiala first visited the Agro School in Pozątín in the Třebíč region, where he discussed with the students and teachers. He then moved to the Pooslaví cooperative in Nová Ves. Minister Jurečka's brother Lukáš Jurečka is the director of the cooperative and in the past he served as a member of the board of directors and later as vice-chairman of the board of directors. We therefore assess the Prime Minister's statement as true.</p>
