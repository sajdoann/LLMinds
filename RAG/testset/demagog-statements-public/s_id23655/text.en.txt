statement: The Czech Statistical Office - a demographic report prepared by experts - tells us after five years that the situation from the perspective of the pension system is worse than five years ago. (…) We will live to an even older age, the number of people of productive age will decrease, and our birth rate will stabilize somewhere around 1.5. additional context: <p>In the context of the statement, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) describes the demographic development and changes in the behavior of Czech society, which, according to him, now require a pension reform and an increase in the retirement age (<a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1096898594-udalosti-komentare/224411000371030/">video</a>, time: 22:50). According to Jurečka, a recent projection by demographers, for example, shows that the number of people of productive age who finance the pension system through pension insurance premiums will decrease. In this context, Jurečka also claims that the latest projection assumes even worse development than the projections from previous years.</p><p><strong>CZSO Demographic Projection</strong></p><p>The Czech Statistical Office (CZSO) publishes a demographic projection every five years (<a href="https://www.rozpoctovarada.cz/ke-stazeni/informacni-studie-alternativni-demograficke-projekce/">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;3). <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/projekce-obyvatelstva-ceske-republiky-2023-2100">The latest</a> projection was published in 2023, the previous one in <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/projekce-obyvatelstva-ceske-republiky-2018-2100">2018</a>. This task is <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1991-582#p10b-1">imposed</a> on the Act on the Organization and Implementation of Social Security. The projection should include the expected development of mortality, fertility and migration in the Czech Republic.</p><p>The Czech Statistical Office processes population projections in three variants - medium, low and high (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;1). These variants differ mainly in the projected population of the Czech Republic - in the medium variant it is stable, in the high variant it increases, in the low variant it decreases (<a href="https://www.rozpoctovarada.cz/ke-stazeni/informacni-studie-alternativni-demograficke-projekce/">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;3). The authors of the CZSO studies state that the medium variant represents the most likely scenario for future population development (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;1). We will therefore base our assessment of Marian Jurečka's statement on data from this middle variant, comparing data from projections from 2018 and 2023.</p><p><strong>Life expectancy</strong></p><p>Life expectancy at birth is an <a href="https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Nad%C4%9Bje_do%C5%BEit%C3%AD">indicator</a> of life expectancy, which indicates the average age a child born in a given generation will live to. Marian Jurečka claims that <i>"we will live to an even older age",</i> i.e. that life expectancy will increase.</p><p>According to the latest projection of the Czech Statistical Office, life expectancy in the Czech Republic has actually been increasing since 1989, with the exception of higher mortality in 2020–2022 associated with the covid-19 pandemic (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;5). Although this increase is slowing down over the years, between 2023 and 2050, life expectancy for men is expected to increase by 5.2 years to 82.2 years and for women by 4.1 years to 87.1 years (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;6). The 2018 projection (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;4) in contrast assumed a slower increase in expected life expectancy. However, as the following table shows, the older projection does not fundamentally differ from the newer one, especially in the case of data for the next approximately 35 years.</p><figure class="embed"><iframe style="border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;" data-external="1" height="430" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1ylDB/6/" id="datawrapper-chart-1ylDB" aria-label="Interactive line chart" title="Life expectancy of men and women (CZSO projections 2018 and 2023)"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p><strong>Number of people of&nbsp;working age</strong></p><p>The productive component of the population is the <a href="https://ghostarchive.org/archive/sI84D">age group</a> between 15 and&nbsp;64&nbsp;years.

By the end of the 2050s, it should fall to 6 million from the current 6.87 million people. At the end of the century, according to the middle variant of the demographic projection from 2023, the number of people of working age will decrease to 5.39 million people (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;14).</p><p>In addition to these numbers, the projections also indicate the share of people of working age in the total population (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;11, <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;14).

The new projection assumes worse numbers compared to the older one only in 2081–2101.</p><figure class="embed"><iframe style="border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;" data-external="1" height="379" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NoOr3/1/" id="datawrapper-chart-NoOr3" aria-label="Interactive line chart" title="Proportion of working-age population"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p><strong>Fertility, fertility</strong></p><p>The birth rate <a href="https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~mak/gos/demmetodika/www.czso.cz/cz/cisla/0/02/020100/narozeni.htm#:~:text=Po%C4%8Det%20%C5%BEiv%C4%9B%20razon%C3%BDch%20d%C4%9Bt%C3%AD%2C%20p%C5%99ipadaj%C3%ADc%C3%AD%20na%201000%20obijatel%med%C3%99edn%C3%ADho%20stavu.">indicates</a> the number of live births per 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;population. The fertility rate <a href="https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Porodnost">makes this figure more precise</a> by expressing the number of these children per thousand women of reproductive age. Statistics also calculate it directly by age (e.g. for women aged 20, 21, etc.). The sum of fertility rates for all age groups (divided by a thousand) expresses the intensity of fertility in the population and indicates the average number of live births per woman, the so-called total fertility.</p><p>Total fertility is an indicator that is <a href="https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Porodnost">suitable</a> for international comparisons, for example. The value of 2.1 children per woman is generally considered sufficient to prevent population decline. If the value falls below 2.1, the population decreases in the long term, and vice versa. Marian Jurečka is clearly confusing the terms total fertility and birth rate in his statement. According to the latest data from the Czech Statistical Office, the birth rate in 2023 reached about 8.4 per thousand (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/d5c66500-c681-32b9-907d-4158ccceefb9/13006924.pdf?version=1.1">.pdf</a>, pp. 5, 36). This is a completely different figure than what Minister Jurečka is talking about.</p><p>According to CZSO data, fertility fell significantly in the 1990s, increased again in the first two decades of the 21st century (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;2) and remained at 1.71 between 2018 and 2020. A year later, it even increased to 1.83. However, there was a drop in 2022 to 1.62 and in 2023 to <a href="https://csu.gov.cz/narozeni?pocet=10&amp;start=0&amp;podskupiny=133&amp;razeni=-datumVyDani">1.45&nbsp;child</a> per woman.</p><p>The CZSO projection from November 2023, based on the current data at the time, estimated that in 2023 the total fertility rate would be 1.5&nbsp;child per woman (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p. 2). In the middle, most likely, variant of the CZSO projection, it assumes that fertility will reach the same value in the following years (p. 3). In contrast, the previous projection from 2018 assumed a gradual stabilization at 1.74 children per woman (<a href="https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;2).</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) summarizes the conclusions of the CZSO regarding the three aforementioned indicators - life expectancy, the number of people of productive age and total fertility, which he confuses with the term <i>“birth rate”</i>. It correctly states that according to the CZSO projection from 2023, life expectancy will increase, the number of people of productive age will decrease and total fertility will stabilize at 1.5 children per woman.</p><p>However, in the statement, it primarily compares the CZSO projections from 2023 and 2018 and says that the newer document assumes <i>"from the perspective of the pension system"</i> worse results than previous estimates. Compared to the older one, the newest projection does indeed assume a faster decline in the fertility rate and a slightly higher increase in life expectancy. In the key category of the share of the working-age population, however, the 2023 projection shows worse results only for the last 20 years of this century, while for the years 2031–2071 (i.e. the next 50 years) it assumes better development than older projections. We therefore assess the statement as misleading.</p>
