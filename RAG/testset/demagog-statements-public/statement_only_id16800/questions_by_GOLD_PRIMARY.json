Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The Czech government actually rejected the Russian accusation, as Brabec claims, and the Russian ambassador was indeed invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We assess the statement as true despite Brabec&#39;s inaccuracy that Minister Stropnický himself negotiated with the Russian ambassador.

The two substances are completely different and have a clearly different chemical structure.</i></p><p> Subsequently, as Brabec claims, the Russian ambassador was indeed invited.
