Václav MORAVEC: Well, the Germans were not accused by Russia. Richard BRABEC: No, but we were, we also made a very strong statement. The government clearly said that it was nonsense, it rejected it, even, if I&#39;m not mistaken, Minister Stropnický invited the Russian ambassador to the carpet, where he very clearly told him that this was simply unacceptable. And I don&#39;t think there was any debate about it there. We rejected it, as a government we clearly reject it, it was nonsense, it never happened.
