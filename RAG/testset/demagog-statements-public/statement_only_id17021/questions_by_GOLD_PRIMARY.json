Representatives of the Svatopluk association agreed with the bankruptcy administrator Josef Monsport that they would not apply <a href=\"http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/klienti-h-systemu-musi-podle-ns-vyklidit-byty-do-mesice-odmitaji-to/1645466\">the Supreme Court&#39;s decision</a> for the time being, according to which H-System clients were to move out of their homes in Horoměřice within thirty days.</p><p> The main success was the agreement to prepare a new expert opinion that will determine the value of the properties. According to the bankruptcy trustee, they are worth about 140 million, according to their residents, ten and a half million. Until the opinion is prepared and evaluated, no one will move. The creditors&#39; committee will decide on August 30 who will prepare the opinion. &quot; <em>Milestone number two will be an agreement on the method of assignment, milestone number three will be an evaluation on both sides,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said the cooperative&#39;s legal representative, Svatopluk</a> Lubomír Kincl. &quot; <em>The opinion should look for what the usual price of the properties is in 2018, but also what it was on several previous dates,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said Josef Monsport.</a></p><p> In 1993, the H-System company concluded contracts with hundreds of interested parties for the construction and transfer of apartments and houses. In the autumn of 1997, it went bankrupt, having completed only 34 family houses. Thousands of people lost about a billion after the collapse of H-System. The Svatopluk housing cooperative was founded by some of the damaged clients in October 1997 with the aim of continuing construction even at the cost of additional investments. The then bankruptcy administrator Karel Kudláček allowed them to do so under certain conditions. However, his successor Monsport later called on them to vacate the properties and enable the sale, with all the clients of the bankrupt company to be satisfied from the proceeds. The members of the cooperative have been in dispute with Monsport since 2000 so that they would not have to move out.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
