The basic problem of the cooperation between KDU-ÄŒSL and STAN was that their mutual agreement was at the level of the party leadership. I am convinced that both chairmen believed in it very much at the time and invested energy in this project. However, it was clear from the beginning that the membership base was not convinced of this project. Our current cooperation in the municipal elections is about something completely different. It was supported by one hundred percent of the members of the TOP 09 regional committee and by over 90 percent of the party members in STAN.
