Zuzana TVARŮŽKOVÁ: As Minister of the Interior, how do you assess the selection of the future head of the General Inspectorate of Security Forces? If it is Radim Dragoun. Jan HAMÁČEK: Then it is not my competence, it is the competence of the Prime Minister. I assume that there were 14 applicants for the position, some kind of selection procedure took place here. Mr. Dragoun, who was therefore selected by the Prime Minister, is still awaiting a hearing in the relevant committee of the Chamber of Deputies and then, after that, an appointment.
