    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The statement is assessed as true because both interested parties, according to their public statements, have indeed agreed on the aforementioned steps.</p><p> The result of another meeting, which was attended by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, among others, was a promise that none of the H-System clients would be evicted from Horoměřice until the case was resolved. Representatives of the Svatopluk association agreed with the bankruptcy administrator Josef Monsport that they would not apply <a href=\"http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/klienti-h-systemu-musi-podle-ns-vyklidit-byty-do-mesice-odmitaji-to/1645466\">the Supreme Court&#39;s decision</a> for the time being, according to which H-System clients were to move out of their homes in Horoměřice within thirty days.</p><p> The main success was the agreement to prepare a new expert opinion that will determine the value of the properties. According to the bankruptcy trustee, they are worth about 140 million, according to their residents, ten and a half million. Until the opinion is prepared and evaluated, no one will move. The creditors&#39; committee will decide on August 30 who will prepare the opinion. &quot; <em>Milestone number two will be an agreement on the method of assignment, milestone number three will be an evaluation on both sides,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said the cooperative&#39;s legal representative, Svatopluk</a> Lubomír Kincl. &quot; <em>The opinion should look for what the usual price of the properties is in 2018, but also what it was on several previous dates,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said Josef Monsport.</a></p><p> In 1993, the H-System company concluded contracts with hundreds of interested parties for the construction and transfer of apartments and houses. In the autumn of 1997, it went bankrupt, having completed only 34 family houses. Thousands of people lost about a billion after the collapse of H-System. The Svatopluk housing cooperative was founded by some of the damaged clients in October 1997 with the aim of continuing construction even at the cost of additional investments. The then bankruptcy administrator Karel Kudláček allowed them to do so under certain conditions. However, his successor Monsport later called on them to vacate the properties and enable the sale, with all the clients of the bankrupt company to be satisfied from the proceeds. The members of the cooperative have been in dispute with Monsport since 2000 so that they would not have to move out.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>One of the points of Babiš&#39;s pre-election <a href=\"https://www.anobudelip.cz/smlouva/\">Treaty with the citizens of the Czech Republic</a> was a sharp stance against migration quotas. It is also important to mention that no party in <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/cesko-dal-bojuje-proti-kvotam-na-uprchliky-navzdory-tomu-ze/r~dd56fd0a932411e7a0c50025900fea04/\">Czech politics</a> expressed support for the quotas set by the European Union for accepting migrants. Slovakia, Hungary and Romania also expressed their opposition to <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/lidri-eu-dosahli-prelomove-dohody-v-migraci-kvoty-jsou-minulosti-167155/\">quotas</a> within the European Union. At the moment, <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/angela-merkelova-uprchlici-kvoty_1806101118_mos\">the tendency is changing</a> and, according to the proposal of the Visegrad countries, so-called flexible solidarity in migration policy could be adopted. Individual member states would then have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to accept refugees or whether their assistance would be financial.</p><p> Illegal migration, i.e. legal entry into our territory but exceeding the permitted period of stay, has had <a href=\"http://www.policie.cz/clanek/nelegalni-migrace-v-ceske-republice-za-rok-2017.aspx\">a downward trend in recent years</a> . However, these data are of a general nature and are in no way related to the refugee crisis, in which the Czech Republic was not and is not a destination country for refugees.</p><p> The truth remains that Andrej Babiš outlined priority points in his election campaign entitled Contract with the Citizens of the Czech Republic and defended himself against migration. However, this text cannot be considered the basis for changing migration policy within the European Union. There were many initiatives and pressures in the EU to change quotas and migration policy, and the Czech Republic was also critical of quotas. The biggest supporters of quotas were the countries that were most affected by the migration wave - Greece, <a href=\"https://zpravy.idnes.cz/minisummit-evropska-unie-migrace-brusel-angela-merkelova-pmy-/zahranicni.aspx?c=A180624_152203_zahranicni_mpl\">Italy</a> , Germany and <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/polsko-i-rakousko-jsou-proti-uprchlickym-kvotam/r~c21f628efc4c11e7ad1e0cc47ab5f122/\">Austria</a> . However, even within them, the quota policy is being abandoned.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
