    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Prime Minister Andrej Babiš <a href=\"https://www.operationsophia.eu/the-prime-minister-of-the-czech-republic-visited-operation-sophias-headquarters/\">met</a> on 28 August 2018 with Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino, who commands the EUNAVFOR MED Operation <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/press/press-releases/2018/05/14/eunavfor-med-operation-sophia-operation-to-contribute-to-better-information-sharing-on-crime-in-the-mediterranean/\">Sophia</a> , but his explanation of international maritime law is inaccurate. International maritime law does not recognize the concept of accidental castaway, and under this maritime law, the captain of a ship flying the flag is obliged to provide assistance to any person found on the high seas who is in danger of death. This also applies to <a href=\"https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/co-delame/migrace-v-souvislostech/zachrana-ve-stredozemnim-mori-se-ridi-mezinarodnim-pravem-3521gp\">migrants</a> rescued in the Mediterranean.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.operationsophia.eu/about-us/\">EU NAVFOR MED Operation Sophia</a> is an EU naval operation established to disrupt the operational model of migrant smugglers and human traffickers in the southern central Mediterranean. Since the start of its active phase (October 2015), the operation has contributed to the arrest of 143 suspected smugglers and human traffickers and their transfer to the Italian authorities, and has neutralised 545 vessels. The operation has also contributed to saving the lives of 44,251 people. Its mandate ends on 31 December 2018.</p><p> The rules of conduct on the seas and oceans are an internationally valid norm, the definition of which is based on the international UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf\">UNCLOS</a> ) of 1982. Currently, this agreement has been signed by <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXI-6&amp;chapter=21&amp;Temp=mtdsg3&amp;clang=_en#1\">157</a> states and actors. Libya is one of the first signatories (1982), but the treaty has not yet been ratified. Italy signed the treaty in 1984 and approved it in 1995. For the sake of the image of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, it signed this agreement already in 1982, but without ratification. This took place only after the division of the republic. The Czech Republic <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#Czech%20Upon%20ratification\">adopted</a> the treaty in 1996 as part of the solution to access to the sea through neighboring Germany.</p><p> Therefore, when it comes to international maritime law, certain rights and obligations arise for the signatories. One of them is the obligation to provide assistance. This fact is described in Article 98 of the UNCLOS Treaty ( <a href=\"http://www.windsea.cz/public/Image/sekce-typ-117/umluva-osn-o-morskem-pravu.pdf\">pdf</a> ., p.25) as follows:</p><p> &quot; <em>Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, if he can do so without serious danger to the ship, its crew or passengers:</em></p><p> <em>(a) rendered assistance to any person found at sea in danger of life;</em></p><p> <em>(b) proceed with the greatest possible speed to the rescue of persons in danger, if he is informed that they need assistance and if such action could reasonably be expected;</em></p><p> <em>(c) after the collision, render assistance to the other ship, its crew and its passengers and, if possible, inform the other ship of the name of its own ship, its home port and the nearest port to which it is sailing.</em></p><p> <em>All coastal States shall facilitate the establishment, operation and maintenance of adequate and effective search and rescue services for the purpose of ensuring safety at and above the sea and, where circumstances so require, shall conclude regional agreements for mutual cooperation with neighbouring States for this purpose.”</em><br/><br/> The International Maritime Organization (IMO) further elaborates on the internationally recognized procedure for rescue at sea in its <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/personsrescued/Documents/Resolution%20A.920(22).pdf\">resolution</a> number A920 from 2001, where it grants the right to rescue to all in danger of life, regardless of their nationality, status and circumstances that led them to a threatening situation. It also determines that the rescuing ship or ships must transport the rescued to safety and treat the rescued in accordance with IMO rules and maritime traditions. The IOM describes general rules and guidelines <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/personsrescued/Pages/Default.aspx\">here</a> .</p><p> The issue of human trafficking is a highly complicated problem, the growing scope of which is also beginning to be perceived internationally, when, following the latest CNN report, the UN imposed <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/06/1011751\">sanctions</a> in June 2018 on several individuals suspected of participating in human trafficking in Libya and called for increased efforts to address this problem.</p><p></p><p></p>\nSECTION B: <p>One of the points of Babiš&#39;s pre-election <a href=\"https://www.anobudelip.cz/smlouva/\">Treaty with the citizens of the Czech Republic</a> was a sharp stance against migration quotas. It is also important to mention that no party in <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/cesko-dal-bojuje-proti-kvotam-na-uprchliky-navzdory-tomu-ze/r~dd56fd0a932411e7a0c50025900fea04/\">Czech politics</a> expressed support for the quotas set by the European Union for accepting migrants. Slovakia, Hungary and Romania also expressed their opposition to <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/lidri-eu-dosahli-prelomove-dohody-v-migraci-kvoty-jsou-minulosti-167155/\">quotas</a> within the European Union. At the moment, <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/angela-merkelova-uprchlici-kvoty_1806101118_mos\">the tendency is changing</a> and, according to the proposal of the Visegrad countries, so-called flexible solidarity in migration policy could be adopted. Individual member states would then have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to accept refugees or whether their assistance would be financial.</p><p> Illegal migration, i.e. legal entry into our territory but exceeding the permitted period of stay, has had <a href=\"http://www.policie.cz/clanek/nelegalni-migrace-v-ceske-republice-za-rok-2017.aspx\">a downward trend in recent years</a> . However, these data are of a general nature and are in no way related to the refugee crisis, in which the Czech Republic was not and is not a destination country for refugees.</p><p> The truth remains that Andrej Babiš outlined priority points in his election campaign entitled Contract with the Citizens of the Czech Republic and defended himself against migration. However, this text cannot be considered the basis for changing migration policy within the European Union. There were many initiatives and pressures in the EU to change quotas and migration policy, and the Czech Republic was also critical of quotas. The biggest supporters of quotas were the countries that were most affected by the migration wave - Greece, <a href=\"https://zpravy.idnes.cz/minisummit-evropska-unie-migrace-brusel-angela-merkelova-pmy-/zahranicni.aspx?c=A180624_152203_zahranicni_mpl\">Italy</a> , Germany and <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/polsko-i-rakousko-jsou-proti-uprchlickym-kvotam/r~c21f628efc4c11e7ad1e0cc47ab5f122/\">Austria</a> . However, even within them, the quota policy is being abandoned.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>The statement is assessed as true because both interested parties, according to their public statements, have indeed agreed on the aforementioned steps.</p><p> The result of another meeting, which was attended by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, among others, was a promise that none of the H-System clients would be evicted from Horoměřice until the case was resolved. Representatives of the Svatopluk association agreed with the bankruptcy administrator Josef Monsport that they would not apply <a href=\"http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/klienti-h-systemu-musi-podle-ns-vyklidit-byty-do-mesice-odmitaji-to/1645466\">the Supreme Court&#39;s decision</a> for the time being, according to which H-System clients were to move out of their homes in Horoměřice within thirty days.</p><p> The main success was the agreement to prepare a new expert opinion that will determine the value of the properties. According to the bankruptcy trustee, they are worth about 140 million, according to their residents, ten and a half million. Until the opinion is prepared and evaluated, no one will move. The creditors&#39; committee will decide on August 30 who will prepare the opinion. &quot; <em>Milestone number two will be an agreement on the method of assignment, milestone number three will be an evaluation on both sides,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said the cooperative&#39;s legal representative, Svatopluk</a> Lubomír Kincl. &quot; <em>The opinion should look for what the usual price of the properties is in 2018, but also what it was on several previous dates,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said Josef Monsport.</a></p><p> In 1993, the H-System company concluded contracts with hundreds of interested parties for the construction and transfer of apartments and houses. In the autumn of 1997, it went bankrupt, having completed only 34 family houses. Thousands of people lost about a billion after the collapse of H-System. The Svatopluk housing cooperative was founded by some of the damaged clients in October 1997 with the aim of continuing construction even at the cost of additional investments. The then bankruptcy administrator Karel Kudláček allowed them to do so under certain conditions. However, his successor Monsport later called on them to vacate the properties and enable the sale, with all the clients of the bankrupt company to be satisfied from the proceeds. The members of the cooperative have been in dispute with Monsport since 2000 so that they would not have to move out.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
