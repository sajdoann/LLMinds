    "Please answer TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWABLE about the text's veracity. In addition write a short summary explaining your answer. If the veracity cannot be determined answer UNKNOWABLE. The first sentence in the response should be TRUE. FALSE. or UNKNOWABLE. eg:UNKNOWABLE.",
    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Since January 2018, pensions have actually <a href=\"https://www.cssz.cz/cz/o-cssz/informace/media/tiskove-zpravy/tiskove-zpravy-2017/2017-12-06-od-ledna-se-valorizuji-vsechny-duchody-cssz-provede-jejich-zvyseni-automaticky.htm\">been valorized</a> . The amount of CZK 475 represents an increase in the average pension, which in September 2017 was CZK 11,828. Therefore, it may be higher or lower for some pension recipients.</p><p> This valorization was approved in September 2017 by the government of Bohuslav Sobotka, i.e. the coalition government.</p><p> The government of Andrej Babiš, which ruled without confidence from December 13, 2017 to June 27, 2018 (i.e. 196 days, which we assess as an insignificant deviation; we leave the assessment of the quality of the government without confidence to the reader) <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/kabinet-andreje-babise-schvalil-navyseni-duchodu-v-prumeru-o-918-korun-mesicne-163624/\">approved</a> the pension insurance amendment in February 2018.</p><p> According to this proposal, pensioners will actually receive an average <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2403196-zmeny-v-duchodech-prosly-vladou-budou-stat-kolem-14-miliard-korun\">increase</a> of CZK 918 (CZK 540 each plus the rest according to the merit part of the pension) from January 2019. The increase in pensions will be an average of CZK 598,&quot; informed the outgoing head of the state treasury, Alena Schillerová (for ANO).<br/><br/> Pensioners over 85 years of age receive an additional CZK 1,000.</p><p> The deputies <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2572831-zive-poslanci-nejspis-podpori-vladni-verzi-zvysovani-duchodu\">agreed</a> to approve the change in pension amounts in August 2018, but the president&#39;s signature is still awaited.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Given the fact that the current President of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, has neither publicly confirmed nor denied his friendly relationship with Andrej Babiš, we have no choice but to assess this statement as unverifiable. Andrej Babiš remains the only one who has publicly described this relationship as friendly. It should be noted that the two have known each other since their joint meetings as finance ministers.</p><p> The relationship between Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and the current President of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, can be traced back to the times when the two met in <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/node/5930801\">negotiations</a> as finance ministers. The common point of their possible good relationship is precisely the area of state finances and Schäuble&#39;s understanding of the different positions of individual EU countries, despite his support for further EU integration, <a href=\"http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/schauble-musime-lidem-dokazat-ze-evropa-muze-znamenat-rozdil-ptj-/tema.aspx?c=A160806_230532_pozice-tema_lube\">the importance of</a> intergovernmental negotiations of EU member <a href=\"https://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/schaeuble-germany-and-france-could-participate-at-visegrad-four-meeting\">states</a> , and, if necessary, practical steps <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1835594-nemecky-ministr-financi-pohrozil-evropske-komisi-ztratou-vlivu-nezacne-li-jednat\">regardless</a> of the European Commission. On the other hand, Schäuble also expressed understanding for <a href=\"https://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/zahranici/evropa/schauble-nemecko-vitanim-bezencu-zachranilo-cest-evropy_358120.html\">the reluctance</a> of some countries towards the redistribution of refugees.</p><p> Andrej Babiš himself has described his relationship with Wolfgang Schäuble as friendly or close several times - for example, in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/premier/v-mediich/rozhovor-predsedy-vlady-andreje-babise-pro-hospodarske-noviny-165627/\">HN</a> on May 18, 2018, he stated the following:</p><p> <em>&quot;We have the same views, for example, with the new German Interior Minister Seehofer, whom I know and I like very much. It is similar with Wolfgang Schäuble, the former Finance Minister, whom I can call my friend,&quot;</em> he added, <em>&quot;Schäuble was previously the Interior Minister and understands that we have a different history of migration, we do not have the multicultural model that exists in some European countries.&quot;</em></p><p> He made a similar statement to the German newspaper <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/interview-with-andrej-babi-we-have-to-defend-our-civilisation-57111396.bild.html\">Bild</a> on September 10, 2018:</p><p> <em>&quot;I think, we have excellent economic ties - and it goes beyond that. Personally, I have a lot of friends in Germany and have just visited my friend Wolfgang Schäuble, whom I came to know in his capacity as finance minister. To me, he has a great personality. Together with the Chancellor, to a greater or lesser extent, we share the same vision of how to solve the migration issue and the Marshall Plan for Africa, based on the Turkish model. However, we have a different opinion on the distribution of migrants on vessels&quot;</em> .</p><p> However, no similar confirmation of a friendly relationship from Wolfgang Schäuble has been found. It should be noted that no publicly available sources indicate that they could not be friends.</p><p> Despite some controversial issues, mutual relations between the Czech Republic and Germany are good, as demonstrated by the last state <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/rozdelovani-bezencu-je-dal-spornym-bodem-vztahu-cr-a-nemecka/1659425\">visit</a> of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš to Germany in September 2018.<br/><br/></p>\nSECTION C: <p>One of the points of Babiš&#39;s pre-election <a href=\"https://www.anobudelip.cz/smlouva/\">Treaty with the citizens of the Czech Republic</a> was a sharp stance against migration quotas. It is also important to mention that no party in <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/cesko-dal-bojuje-proti-kvotam-na-uprchliky-navzdory-tomu-ze/r~dd56fd0a932411e7a0c50025900fea04/\">Czech politics</a> expressed support for the quotas set by the European Union for accepting migrants. Slovakia, Hungary and Romania also expressed their opposition to <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/lidri-eu-dosahli-prelomove-dohody-v-migraci-kvoty-jsou-minulosti-167155/\">quotas</a> within the European Union. At the moment, <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/angela-merkelova-uprchlici-kvoty_1806101118_mos\">the tendency is changing</a> and, according to the proposal of the Visegrad countries, so-called flexible solidarity in migration policy could be adopted. Individual member states would then have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to accept refugees or whether their assistance would be financial.</p><p> Illegal migration, i.e. legal entry into our territory but exceeding the permitted period of stay, has had <a href=\"http://www.policie.cz/clanek/nelegalni-migrace-v-ceske-republice-za-rok-2017.aspx\">a downward trend in recent years</a> . However, these data are of a general nature and are in no way related to the refugee crisis, in which the Czech Republic was not and is not a destination country for refugees.</p><p> The truth remains that Andrej Babiš outlined priority points in his election campaign entitled Contract with the Citizens of the Czech Republic and defended himself against migration. However, this text cannot be considered the basis for changing migration policy within the European Union. There were many initiatives and pressures in the EU to change quotas and migration policy, and the Czech Republic was also critical of quotas. The biggest supporters of quotas were the countries that were most affected by the migration wave - Greece, <a href=\"https://zpravy.idnes.cz/minisummit-evropska-unie-migrace-brusel-angela-merkelova-pmy-/zahranicni.aspx?c=A180624_152203_zahranicni_mpl\">Italy</a> , Germany and <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/polsko-i-rakousko-jsou-proti-uprchlickym-kvotam/r~c21f628efc4c11e7ad1e0cc47ab5f122/\">Austria</a> . However, even within them, the quota policy is being abandoned.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>The statement is assessed as true because both interested parties, according to their public statements, have indeed agreed on the aforementioned steps.</p><p> The result of another meeting, which was attended by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, among others, was a promise that none of the H-System clients would be evicted from Horoměřice until the case was resolved. Representatives of the Svatopluk association agreed with the bankruptcy administrator Josef Monsport that they would not apply <a href=\"http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/klienti-h-systemu-musi-podle-ns-vyklidit-byty-do-mesice-odmitaji-to/1645466\">the Supreme Court&#39;s decision</a> for the time being, according to which H-System clients were to move out of their homes in Horoměřice within thirty days.</p><p> The main success was the agreement to prepare a new expert opinion that will determine the value of the properties. According to the bankruptcy trustee, they are worth about 140 million, according to their residents, ten and a half million. Until the opinion is prepared and evaluated, no one will move. The creditors&#39; committee will decide on August 30 who will prepare the opinion. &quot; <em>Milestone number two will be an agreement on the method of assignment, milestone number three will be an evaluation on both sides,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said the cooperative&#39;s legal representative, Svatopluk</a> Lubomír Kincl. &quot; <em>The opinion should look for what the usual price of the properties is in 2018, but also what it was on several previous dates,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said Josef Monsport.</a></p><p> In 1993, the H-System company concluded contracts with hundreds of interested parties for the construction and transfer of apartments and houses. In the autumn of 1997, it went bankrupt, having completed only 34 family houses. Thousands of people lost about a billion after the collapse of H-System. The Svatopluk housing cooperative was founded by some of the damaged clients in October 1997 with the aim of continuing construction even at the cost of additional investments. The then bankruptcy administrator Karel Kudláček allowed them to do so under certain conditions. However, his successor Monsport later called on them to vacate the properties and enable the sale, with all the clients of the bankrupt company to be satisfied from the proceeds. The members of the cooperative have been in dispute with Monsport since 2000 so that they would not have to move out.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The current situation in Libya is indeed quite problematic. The political factions seeking to govern are divided by both their divergent interests and their unwillingness to recognize the authority of any one of them.</p><p> This situation could be resolved by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/macron-hosts-libyan-factions-in-paris-in-push-to-secure-elections\">the elections scheduled</a> for December 10, 2018; according to the agreement, the parties should reach a decision on the regulations according to which these elections will take place by September 16, 2018.</p><p> However, since the May meeting of Libyan factions, there have been several changes in the influence of individual groups. <a href=\"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/why-libyan-elections-probably-wont-happen-year\">Confidence</a> in the formation of a stable government and the very promise of elections is not strengthened by previous unsuccessful attempts to establish a unified government and the fragmented political situation in the country.</p><p> Italy has also joined the talks between political groups in Libya. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-libya/italys-pm-conte-sees-no-rush-for-libyan-election-idUSKBN1KT1PH\">Giuseppe Conte said</a> he would organize a separate conference to stabilize Libya, with the support of Donald Trump, which could take place in November. Asked about the opinion of Emmanuel Macron, who led the previous agreement, he added that this agreement is in no way detrimental to any previous agreement made by other European countries.</p><p> As for the part of the statement regarding Operation <a href=\"https://www.operationsophia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Press-Kit.pdf\">Sophia</a> (.pdf), it is true that the Czech Republic is one of the 26 participating Member States. The main task of the operation is to cooperate with the Libyan Coast Guard and Navy in maintaining control over parts of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p> However, its effectiveness, according to data for the first half of 2018, is less than fifty percent. According to the Washington Post, the Libyan Coast Guard <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/fewer-migrants-are-making-it-to-europe-heres-why/2018/07/23/80b56082-8c57-11e8-9d59-dccc2c0cabcf_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.128395d0f156\">intercepted</a> only one in nine migrants crossing the Mediterranean in 2017. This year, that number has increased to two in five. Specifically, in June 2018, the guard intercepted about 47% of migrants.</p><p> The Italian company Eni S. p. A., the largest foreign <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-libya/italys-pm-conte-sees-no-rush-for-libyan-election-idUSKBN1KT1PH\">oil producer</a> operating in <a href=\"https://www.eni.com/enipedia/en_IT/international-presence/africa/enis-activities-in-libya.page\">Libya</a> , which Andrej Babiš apparently has in mind in his statement, is controlled by the state, which owns about 30% <a href=\"https://www.eni.com/en_IT/company/governance/shareholders.page\">of the share</a> , but it is currently no longer a &quot;state company&quot;, even though it was originally <a href=\"https://www.eni.com/en_IT/company/eni-history.page\">founded</a> on the basis of law.</p><p> We were unable to confirm or deny the alleged complications with the provision of fuel for the Libyan guard from available sources.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>Prime Minister Andrej Babiš <a href=\"https://www.operationsophia.eu/the-prime-minister-of-the-czech-republic-visited-operation-sophias-headquarters/\">met</a> on 28 August 2018 with Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino, who commands the EUNAVFOR MED Operation <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/press/press-releases/2018/05/14/eunavfor-med-operation-sophia-operation-to-contribute-to-better-information-sharing-on-crime-in-the-mediterranean/\">Sophia</a> , but his explanation of international maritime law is inaccurate. International maritime law does not recognize the concept of accidental castaway, and under this maritime law, the captain of a ship flying the flag is obliged to provide assistance to any person found on the high seas who is in danger of death. This also applies to <a href=\"https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/co-delame/migrace-v-souvislostech/zachrana-ve-stredozemnim-mori-se-ridi-mezinarodnim-pravem-3521gp\">migrants</a> rescued in the Mediterranean.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.operationsophia.eu/about-us/\">EU NAVFOR MED Operation Sophia</a> is an EU naval operation established to disrupt the operational model of migrant smugglers and human traffickers in the southern central Mediterranean. Since the start of its active phase (October 2015), the operation has contributed to the arrest of 143 suspected smugglers and human traffickers and their transfer to the Italian authorities, and has neutralised 545 vessels. The operation has also contributed to saving the lives of 44,251 people. Its mandate ends on 31 December 2018.</p><p> The rules of conduct on the seas and oceans are an internationally valid norm, the definition of which is based on the international UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf\">UNCLOS</a> ) of 1982. Currently, this agreement has been signed by <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXI-6&amp;chapter=21&amp;Temp=mtdsg3&amp;clang=_en#1\">157</a> states and actors. Libya is one of the first signatories (1982), but the treaty has not yet been ratified. Italy signed the treaty in 1984 and approved it in 1995. For the sake of the image of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, it signed this agreement already in 1982, but without ratification. This took place only after the division of the republic. The Czech Republic <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#Czech%20Upon%20ratification\">adopted</a> the treaty in 1996 as part of the solution to access to the sea through neighboring Germany.</p><p> Therefore, when it comes to international maritime law, certain rights and obligations arise for the signatories. One of them is the obligation to provide assistance. This fact is described in Article 98 of the UNCLOS Treaty ( <a href=\"http://www.windsea.cz/public/Image/sekce-typ-117/umluva-osn-o-morskem-pravu.pdf\">pdf</a> ., p.25) as follows:</p><p> &quot; <em>Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, if he can do so without serious danger to the ship, its crew or passengers:</em></p><p> <em>(a) rendered assistance to any person found at sea in danger of life;</em></p><p> <em>(b) proceed with the greatest possible speed to the rescue of persons in danger, if he is informed that they need assistance and if such action could reasonably be expected;</em></p><p> <em>(c) after the collision, render assistance to the other ship, its crew and its passengers and, if possible, inform the other ship of the name of its own ship, its home port and the nearest port to which it is sailing.</em></p><p> <em>All coastal States shall facilitate the establishment, operation and maintenance of adequate and effective search and rescue services for the purpose of ensuring safety at and above the sea and, where circumstances so require, shall conclude regional agreements for mutual cooperation with neighbouring States for this purpose.”</em><br/><br/> The International Maritime Organization (IMO) further elaborates on the internationally recognized procedure for rescue at sea in its <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/personsrescued/Documents/Resolution%20A.920(22).pdf\">resolution</a> number A920 from 2001, where it grants the right to rescue to all in danger of life, regardless of their nationality, status and circumstances that led them to a threatening situation. It also determines that the rescuing ship or ships must transport the rescued to safety and treat the rescued in accordance with IMO rules and maritime traditions. The IOM describes general rules and guidelines <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/personsrescued/Pages/Default.aspx\">here</a> .</p><p> The issue of human trafficking is a highly complicated problem, the growing scope of which is also beginning to be perceived internationally, when, following the latest CNN report, the UN imposed <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/06/1011751\">sanctions</a> in June 2018 on several individuals suspected of participating in human trafficking in Libya and called for increased efforts to address this problem.</p><p></p><p></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
