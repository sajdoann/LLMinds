Look at how we are increasing pensions. Here we are, the coalition government, we haven&#39;t had time yet. And here we are, 2018, 475 crowns and this is the proposal of the minority government of the ANO movement. That, my government, which ruled brilliantly for 205 days, without confidence, but it worked perfectly, is increasing 918 crowns on average per month and another 1,000 crowns for pensioners aged 85.
