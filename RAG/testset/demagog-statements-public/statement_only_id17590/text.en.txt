TAKÁČ: I&#39;ll stop with those names, Karel Sýs was there too. (...) You supported him. You too, if I&#39;m not mistaken. BARTOŠ: Yes, we did the thing, we explained the thing. There was a point that was put forward, where there was a vote on it and less people voted, and we accidentally voted for Mr. Sýs. However, his, his nomination did not stand up to and did not match the vote of the Pirates, and we apologized for that.
