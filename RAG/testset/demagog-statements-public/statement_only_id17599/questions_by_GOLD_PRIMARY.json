    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>A trust fund is, according to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2012-89#p1448\">§1448</a> et seq. of the Civil Code, an entity without legal personality. It is created by separating the founder&#39;s property. The creation of a trust fund creates separate and independent property that has no owner.</p><p> Although the ownership rights to the trust fund are exercised by the trustee, it is necessary to be aware that, according to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2012-89#p1448-3\">Section 1448(3)</a> of the Civil Code, the ownership rights to the fund do not belong to the trustee, the founder, or the person who is to receive payments from the trust fund.</p><p> It cannot be claimed that someone is the owner of the assets in the trust fund. However, it is possible to infer from Ivan Bartoš&#39;s speech that he is convinced that Andrej Babiš still has a decisive influence on the assets in the trust fund, even though he is not its owner according to the law.</p><p> If this were true, then it could be said that Andrej Babiš is the beneficial owner of the trust fund as understood by Act No. 253/2008 Coll., on certain measures against the legalization of proceeds from crime and the financing of terrorism. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2008-253#p4-4\">Section 4(4)</a> of this Act, the beneficial owner of a trust fund would be a person who has the factual or legal ability to exercise direct or indirect decisive influence over the trust fund.</p><p> Provided that these conditions are met, there is <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2008-253#p4-4-c\">a rebuttable presumption</a> (&quot; <em>it is presumed that&quot;</em> ) that the beneficial owner of the trust fund is, for example, the founder, trustee or beneficiary. For the sake of completeness, let us state that the Civil Code <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2012-89#p1457-1\">defines</a> the beneficiary as the person who <a href=\"https://www.pravniprostor.cz/clanky/obcanske-pravo/sverenske-fondy-pravni-uprava-a-jejich-vyuziti\">benefits</a> from the trust fund. This is related to Act No. 304/2013 Coll., on public registers of legal and natural persons, which establishes <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2013-304#p118b\">a register of beneficial owners</a> . However, this register <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2013-304#p118c\">is not</a> a public register.</p><p> Although the registered data on the founder and beneficiary of the trust fund <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2013-304#p65e-1\">are not disclosed</a> without consent, it is possible to conclude that the beneficiary and founder is Andrej Babiš. This is indicated by the publicly available data on the trustees (they are Alexej Bílek and Zbyněk Průša), as well as <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-podava-prvni-podnet-tykajici-se-stretu-zajmu-andreje-babise/\">the findings of</a> Transparency International (see also <a href=\"http://www.taxparency.eu/cz/structures/#TS4_MAFRA\">the graph</a> below, or the table <a href=\"http://www.taxparency.eu/structures/pdf/TS4_MAFRA.pdf?2\">here</a> ).</p><p> In connection with this information and other data from <em>the Register of Public Sector Partners,</em> two<a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/wp-content/uploads/Open-Letter-to-the-European-Commission.pdf\">complaints</a> were <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-issues-a-second-complaint-about-andrej-babiss-conflict-of-interest-and-european-subsidies-for-agrofert/\">filed by</a> the Czech Transparency International regarding Babiš&#39;s possible conflict of interest. Unlike the register of beneficial owners, <em>the Register of Partners</em> is public and Andrej Babiš <em>appears</em> as one of <a href=\"https://rpvs.gov.sk/rpvs/Partner/Partner/Detail/7859\"><em>the ultimate beneficiaries,</em></a> along with the two aforementioned trustees.</p><p> For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to note that <em>the ultimate beneficial owner</em> is a term defined in <a href=\"https://www.zakonypreludi.sk/zz/2008-297/znenie-20180315#p6a\">Section 6a</a> of Act No. 297/2008 Coll. on <em>protection against legalization of proceeds from crime and terrorism.</em> According to <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-agrofert-sverenske-fondy-premier-transparency-international_1806192243_haf\">the statements</a> of the AGROFERT concern and Andrej Babiš, this term is different from the term <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2008-253#p4-4\">beneficial owner</a> under Czech law. <br/><br/><br/></p><p></p><img src=\"https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaXNJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c67f0f037d3f7ce119556aa0fcc8be289a6c9602/TI5_MAFRA_struktura.png\" alt=\"\"/><p></p>\nSECTION B: <p>The Chamber of Deputies&#39; proposals for granting or awarding state decorations, specifically the nomination for the decoration of Karel Sýs, were <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=67755\">voted</a> on May 25, 2018. 14 Pirate deputies voted in favor. However, the Pirates later apologized for voting for the state decoration for Karel Sýs. Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Vojtěch Pikal, who admitted his mistake in an interview with iRozhlas.cz, said <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/statni-vyznamenani-2018-karel-sys-basnik-vojtech-pikal_1805261809_ako\">the following</a> :</p><p> &quot; <em>I made the mistake of not studying the personalities enough. I relied on the words of the other deputies from the subcommittee. I thought I would have more time to prepare that day. I did not know that I would be presiding over the Chamber and standing in for Speaker Vondráček (Radek Vondráček from ANO), who suddenly lost his voice.&quot;</em></p><p> While Pikal apologizes for not having studied the personalities well enough, Chairman Bartoš talks about the item being put forward and the vote being taken by mistake. According to <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013121.htm\">the shorthand report,</a> the vote was as follows:</p><p> <em>PSP Deputy Chairman Vojtěch Pikal: The next proposal is Karel Sýs.<br/> PSP Deputy Chairman Vojtěch Filip: I have started voting number 96 and I am asking who is in favor. Who is against? Thank you.<br/> Voting number 96. Of the 161 deputies present, 108 voted in favor, 25 against. The proposal was adopted.</em></p><p> Pirates chairman Ivan Bartoš commented on the vote for Karel Sýs in an interview <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/474479-pirat-bartos-nekdy-delame-hlouposti-a-obcas-naletime-ale-jsme-pokorni.html\">as follows</a> :</p><p> &quot; <em>Nominations for the award were supposed to be discussed only at the end of the second week, but they were put forward. We had not gone through them. About three names were voted on in the plenary session within one minute, some Pirate MPs noticed the problematic Mr. Sýs and abstained from voting, some followed Vojta Pikal&#39;s recommendation.&quot;</em></p><p> On October 25, 2018, a vote was also taken on <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013117.htm\">a proposal</a> to permanently include item 117 regarding state awards on the same day, and this proposal was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=67735\">adopted</a> . The shortened period before the vote may therefore have had an impact on its outcome, although we cannot verify whether the Pirates voted &quot;by mistake&quot;.<br/><br/> The nomination required 81 MPs to vote in favor. The proposal to nominate Karel Sýs for the state award was approved, with a total of 108 MPs voting in favor, including 14 MPs from the Pirate Party. So even if the Pirate Party MPs had not voted in favor of the proposal, it would still have passed.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Chairman Bartoš (Pirates) is referring to the amendment to the Civil Service Act. The amendment proposal was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=132\">submitted</a> by the government on March 26, 2018.</p><p> Documents that demonstrate the European Commission&#39;s critical stance on the amendment were published on June 7, 2018 by <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj\">the iRozhlas.cz</a> server. Specifically, it is <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf\">a letter</a> (.pdf) addressed to the Deputy Minister of the Interior for the Civil Service, <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/vedeni-ministerstva-260932.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Mg%3D%3D\">Josef Postránecký</a> . The letter states that, based on a meeting on March 20, 2018, both parties reached a consensus on the need for further amendments to the draft Civil Service Act. The first part of the letter summarizes the commission&#39;s conclusions from the Report on the Czech Republic 2018 ( <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/2018-european-semester-country-report-czech-republic-en.pdf\">.pdf, p. 37</a> ). The criticism was directed at the administrative burden resulting from the proposal, the inability to attract experts from the academic and private sectors. The letter also mentions a large number of dismissals in leading positions after the new government took office, which does not correspond to the desired depoliticization of the state administration ( <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf\">.pdf, p. 1</a> ).</p><p> This part of the letter is crucial: &quot; <em>We therefore remain concerned about key elements of the proposal. For example, the shift to somewhat lower requirements for second rounds of selection procedures for management positions, the possibility of dismissing managers based on</em> a &#39; <em>sufficient</em> &#39; <em>evaluation result, the possibility of dismissing civil servants based on two performance evaluations within a 40-day period, and the deprivation of managers from the possibility of filing an objection to performance evaluations.&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf\">.pdf, p. 2</a> - translation by <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj\">the iRozhlas.cz</a> server used).</p><p> The European Commission&#39;s criticism was directed at changes in the evaluation of civil servants&#39; work and the shortening of the period between individual evaluations.</p><p> The extension of the minimum period of 40 days between individual assessments to 60 days, or in the case of an extraordinary assessment after a previous assessment with an <em>unsatisfactory</em> result to 90 days, was presented in an amendment by Kateřina Valachová (ČSSD) ( <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138713\">docx, pp. 4 and 10</a> ). Her amendment was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=68390\">adopted</a> .</p><p> Minister Dostálová (ANO) submitted an amendment to Section 60, paragraph 3 ( <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138717\">.docx, page 1</a> ):</p><p> <em>&quot;X. In Section 60, paragraph 3, first and second sentences, the words &quot;, State Secretary&quot; are inserted after the words &quot;Deputy for Civil Service&quot;.<br/><br/> X. In Section 60, the following sentence is added at the end of paragraph 3: &quot;A proposal to dismiss the Deputy for Civil Service and the Human Resources Director of the Civil Service Section shall be submitted to the Government by the Minister of the Interior, a proposal to dismiss the State Secretary shall be submitted to the Government by the relevant minister or the head of the Government Office after discussion with the Deputy for Civil Service.&quot;</em></p><p> According to Dostálová&#39;s amendment, the dismissal of state secretaries is therefore possible based on a government decision following the recommendation of the minister, as Bartoš states in his statement.</p><p> The expansion of the scale and conditions of personal evaluation was regulated by the proposal in Section 155 (. <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134549\">pdf, p. 24</a> ), among other things, it planned to expand the evaluation scale from 4 to 5 categories:</p><p> , <em>,3) The performance evaluation must contain a conclusion on whether the civil servant achieved in the service</em></p><p> <em>a) excellent results,</em></p><p> <em>b) very good results,</em></p><p> c <em>) good results,</em></p><p> d <em>) satisfactory results, or</em></p><p> (e <em>) unsatisfactory results.”</em></p><p> The proposal therefore implies that the evaluation scale has been expanded. To terminate the employment relationship, it is &quot;enough&quot; to obtain a rating of d) and e), in the words of Chairman Bartoš, &quot; <em>a five or a four&quot;.<br/></em><br/> The initial wording of the draft amendment regulated the conditions for dismissal from service in Section 60, Article 1, Part b): &quot; <em>the service evaluation contains a conclusion that the official achieved unsatisfactory or satisfactory results in service&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134549\">.pdf, p. 16</a> ). In this case, no <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138947\">amendment proposal</a> (.pdf) was submitted that would specifically change this provision. It can be said that the possibility of dismissing an official from service for a <em>satisfactory (&quot;four&quot;)</em> evaluation thus remained in the proposal, although (as of November 1, 2018) we cannot <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?o=8&amp;v=US&amp;ct=372&amp;fbclid=IwAR1xFaCcnQoQ8hlHnDguF5qbwVymlDT-FybJNQ7rJoXSGHSwBNBtEzdVrus\">confirm</a> this with the press, which the Senate should now have. The EC&#39;s reprimand in this case was not corrected by the amendments, and we therefore assess the statement of Chairman Bartoš as untrue.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
