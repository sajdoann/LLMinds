We managed to fix a few things there. The fundamental reservations that the European Commission had about the proposal, that the period for which you have the remedy is being shortened, that the scale of the assessment is actually being expanded, so that you can actually fire the person if they get a five or a four. We tried to fix that with the help of amendments, and that seemed to be successful. However, Minister Dostálová included the amendment that actually allows getting rid of those state secretaries by decision of the government, on the recommendation of the minister.
