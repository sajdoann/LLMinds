    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Two parliamentary proposals dealing with the definition of marriage were recently submitted to the Chamber of Deputies. According to the first <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135812\">proposal</a> (.pdf), which was sent to deputies on June 13, the Civil Code and related regulations should be amended, and the definition of marriage contained therein as a union between a man and a woman should be changed to a union between two people.</p><p> The proposal to equalize same-sex unions <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=201&amp;sp=1\">was submitted by</a> a group of deputies from ANO, Pirates, ČSSD, TOP 09, KSČM and STAN. The Pirates club was the most united in this case, with seventeen out of the total twenty-two deputies submitting the bill.</p><p> Two days later, another <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135903\">proposal</a> (.pdf) was sent to the deputies, according to which the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms should be amended, where Article 32 would be supplemented with an explicit definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Currently, the first sentence <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-2#cl32-1\">of Article 32</a> protects parenthood and the family; if the amendment to the Charter is approved, parenthood, family and marriage as a union between a man and a woman would be protected.</p><p> The proposal to amend the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=211&amp;sp=1\">was submitted by</a> a group of deputies from the parliamentary groups ANO, KDU-ČSL, ODS, ČSSD, TOP 09 and STAN. Apart from the KDU-ČSL club, where all ten deputies submitted the proposal, the other parliamentary groups were by no means united. </p><div><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-gCEa9\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gCEa9/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" height=\"390\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":471,\"200\":444,\"300\":417,\"400\":417,\"500\":390,\"700\":390,\"800\":390,\"900\":390,\"1000\":390},window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-gCEa9\"),window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"gCEa9\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});</script></div><p> From the table we can see that the deputies (with the exception of the KDU-ČSL club and to some extent the Pirates) do not really decide according to the party program, but very freely according to their own discretion. Thus, in several parliamentary clubs there are both streams of opinion, i.e. deputies who support equal rights for same-sex unions and those who, on the contrary, want to protect marriage as a union between a man and a woman by constitutional order.</p><p> In the last election period, <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=111102\">a proposal</a> (.pdf) to amend the Registered Partnership Act was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow registered partners to adopt the child of the other partner, thus ensuring the child&#39;s equal legal relationship to both partners. This proposal was also <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=7&amp;t=320&amp;sp=1\">submitted</a> by a very diverse group of MPs from six parliamentary groups (all except the KDU-ČSL group), but it was not voted on.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Jiří Pospíšil stated in an interview for Czech Radio that if Andrej Babiš proceeds in this way, he should offer the Italian government another form of assistance. Although he did not directly criticize his actions, he did not express direct approval either. That he would directly defend Babiš is indeed an abbreviation that was published by Parlamentní listy in its text.</p><p> The chairman of TOP 09 <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/jiri-pospisil-z-top-09-vadi-mi-legitimizace-kscm-a-personalni-nestabilita-vlady-7568537\">commented</a> on Andrej Babiš&#39;s response to the Italian government&#39;s refusal to accept some refugees (video, 7:12) on Radiožurnál&#39;s 20 minut program. However, he did not directly agree with the prime minister&#39;s decision, only stating that it would be good to offer Italy other assistance in such a case and not close ourselves off from further communication.</p><p> <em>&quot;I personally think that at a time when the Czech Republic and, in principle, the entire political representation rejects mandatory quotas, the redistribution of refugees against their will across Europe, it would be reasonable to offer the Italian side some other form of assistance than accepting refugees who are not going to the Czech Republic themselves and have not applied for asylum in the Czech Republic. I am convinced that we should grant asylum to those who apply for asylum in the Czech Republic and meet the conditions of Czech legislation and Czech laws.&quot;</em></p><p> His response <a href=\"https://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/arena/monitor/Sef-TOP-09-Pospisil-se-zastal-Babise-ve-veci-prijimani-uprchliku-Opravdu-544446\">was distorted by</a> Parlamentní listy, which incorrectly reported Jiří Pospíšil&#39;s agreement with Andrej Babiš in the headline of the article: &quot; <em>Top 09 boss Pospíšil stood up for Babiš on the issue of accepting refugees. Really.&quot;</em> Therefore, we assess the statement as true.</p><p> Miroslav Kalousek and Karel Schwarzenberg criticized Jiří Pospíšil&#39;s alleged statement as inconsistent with TOP09&#39;s current policy. Miroslav Kalousek did so on his <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/kalousekm\">Twitter</a> account, where <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/kalousekm/status/1019668599047376897\">he stated</a> that he respects his chairman, but cannot agree with his opinion. </p><img src=\"https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcThIIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--532043fe64b0c36ec5a9956b4d6523d2c3645a4c/Kalousek.JPG\" alt=\"\"/><p> Karel Schwarzenberg <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/karel.schwarzenberg/posts/10155878321623925\">also</a> made a similar statement on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/karel.schwarzenberg/?hc_ref=ARQbgOTuh5xns5Yx8S6k29APpGeo0c7HIs7Fjn3v2xAreXKCH3UEh9FkxpI0wl8LwLE&amp;fref=nf\">his Facebook</a> page: <em>&quot;The government&#39;s attitude towards the Italian Prime Minister&#39;s request is, firstly, stupid, secondly, inhumane, and thirdly, contrary to our principles, which are based on our Judeo-Christian spiritual heritage.&quot;</em> He also spoke in a similar vein in <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66206170-meli-jsme-vyhovet-italii-a-prijmout-uprchliky-pro-eu-prestavame-byt-seriozni-a-duveryhodni-rika-schwarzenberg\">an interview</a> with Hospodářské noviny. </p><img src=\"https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBckFIIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e345ae7ed0b5863afd5c6e6caa6629e6e446c1a7/Schwarzenberg.JPG\" alt=\"\"/><p><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\nSECTION C: <p>Crimea was <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-61891160-krym-a-sevastopol-oficialne-patri-k-rusku-putin-podepsal-smlouvu-o-pripojeni\">annexed</a> by Russia on 21 March 2014. The annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia was preceded by a referendum announced by the Crimean parliament, which was held on 16 March 2014. The referendum <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1043406-krym-o-referendum-byl-velky-zajem\">asked</a> the following two questions:</p><p> &quot; <em>Are you in favor of the reunification of Crimea with Russia with the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation?</em> &quot;</p><p> &quot; <em>Are you in favor of restoring the 1992 constitution and the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine?</em> &quot;</p><p> However, as has been pointed out (e.g. <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-61857960-zive-pro-pripojeni-krymu-k-rusku-je-pres-95-procent-lidi-eu-rozhodne-o-sankcich\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/world/europe/crimea-vote-does-not-offer-choice-of-status-quo.html\">here</a> ), the difference on these issues is minimal. The 1992 constitution, adopted at the time of the collapse of the USSR, granted Crimea extensive autonomy. Crimea was annexed to Ukraine in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev and had previously belonged to Russia for 170 years.</p><p> Shortly after Russia&#39;s annexation of Crimea, pro-Russian militants in eastern Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/donbas-obse-ukrajina-prorusti-povstalci_1808031711_dbr\">occupied</a> the Donbas and Luhansk regions and declared two people&#39;s republics. According to Ukraine, Moscow is the military backer of the separatists. Moscow has long <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/donbas-armada/r~94f2eca2880411e7aec7002590604f2e/\">denied</a> sending Russian troops to the Donbas. However, in 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/vladimir-putin-admits-russian-military-presence-ukraine\">told</a> a press conference: &quot; <em>We never said that there were no people there who performed certain tasks in the military sphere</em> .&quot;<em> </em>However, according to him, this is not the same as sending Russian troops.</p><p> In February 2017, the UN issued <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21730&amp;LangID=E\">a report</a> according to which the conflict in Donbass had already claimed 10,090 victims, of which 2,777 were civilians. In 2014, the first Minsk Agreement was <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/EPRS/EPRS-Briefing-548991-Minsk-peace-summit-FINAL.pdf\">negotiated</a> (.pdf, p. 2) between Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, but it was soon violated by pro-Russian separatists who seized territory in eastern Ukraine. In February 2015, the second Minsk Agreement was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1502444-uspesny-minsk-dohoda-na-primeri-i-demarkacni-linii\">reached</a> in Belarus, which agreed on a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, an amnesty for all participants in the fighting, and also, for example, a constitutional reform allowing for the decentralization of rebel areas by the end of the year. According to the UN, both agreements are still <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/osn-donbas-civilisti-ukrajina-minska-dohoda-poruseni_1806210808_gol\">being violated</a> by both sides.</p><p> The Council of the EU condemned the annexation of Crimea. On 17 March 2014, <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/meetings/fac/2014/03/17/\">it adopted</a> &quot; <em>restrictive measures against 21 individuals and persons and entities associated with them in connection with their involvement in activities that threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.</em> &quot;<em> </em>The foreign ministers also condemned the Crimean referendum at this Council and did not recognise its result. The Council considered the referendum held to be illegal and in clear violation of the Ukrainian constitution. Since March 2014, the EU has adopted a series <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/\">of restrictive measures</a> against Russia in response to the Ukrainian crisis. Most recently, in September 2018, <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/history-ukraine-crisis/\">it extended</a> the sanctions imposed in connection with the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p><p> The annexation of Crimea is contrary to international law, as stated in <a href=\"http://www.osn.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/charta-organizace-spojenych-narodu-a-statut-mezinarodniho-soudniho-dvora.pdf\">the UN Charter</a> (.pdf, p. 5) in Article 2, paragraph 4:</p><p> <em>4.</em> &quot; <em>All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.</em> &quot;<em><br/></em><br/> As Christian Marxsen of the Planck Institute also <a href=\"http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf4/Marxsen_2014_-_The_crimea_crisis_-_an_international_law_perspective.pdf\">summarizes</a> (.pdf), Russian arguments about protecting the Russian-speaking population abroad or intervention based on invitation will not stand up under international law.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Although the approval of the electoral coalition between STAN and KDU-ČSL for the 2017 elections was not always supported by an overwhelming majority of the membership, its participation, albeit somewhat limited, in the approval process of their coalition cooperation cannot be denied. The coalition project was not formed only at the level of the party leadership, as Pospíšil states.</p><p> One of the first reports of possible cooperation between the KDU-ČSL and STAN appeared in December 2016, when the KDU-ČSL National Conference <a href=\"https://kdu.cz/aktualne/archiv/2016/kdu-csl-jsme-pripraveni-jednat-o-spolupraci-se-sta\">authorized</a> the party&#39;s presidium to begin negotiations for cooperation in the upcoming elections to the Chamber of Deputies in 2017.</p><p> Initially, there was the possibility of a so-called integration party, in which a new entity would be created, whose candidate lists would consist of members of two cooperating parties. However, this project was <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/info-a-media/tiskove-zpravy/o-koalici-s-kdu-csl-rozhodneme-brzy\">rejected by</a> the KDU-ČSL National Conference, and instead <a href=\"https://kdu.cz/aktualne/archiv/2017/kdu-csl-celostatni-konference-podporuje-dlouhodobo\">the conference authorized</a> the presidium to negotiate cooperation between the parties at the level of an electoral coalition.</p><p> The offer of coalition cooperation for the 2017 elections was accepted by the Mayor when a similar mandate for the leadership of STAN was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2032940-starostove-chteji-jit-do-voleb-v-koalici-s-lidovci-museli-ziskat-pres-10-procent\">approved by</a> 81% of the delegates <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/nasi-lide/celostatni-vybor-stan\">of the STAN National Committee.</a></p><p> The electoral coalition was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2060128-lidovci-souhlasi-se-spolecnou-koalici-se-starosty-pujdou-do-voleb\">approved</a> by the KDU-ČSL National Conference on 18 March 2017 with 39 delegates in favour and 31 against. A week later, the coalition cooperation was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2064908-starostove-chteji-kandidovat-s-lidovci-pro-koalici-bylo-86-procent-delegatu\">approved</a> by the STAN (Supreme Council of the Republic), with 101 out of 117 delegates voting in favour.</p><p> Based on these votes and ongoing negotiations, the parties <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/volby/archiv/parlamentni-volby-2017/nejnovejsi-informace/kdu-csl-a-stan-podepsali-koalicni-smlouvu\">signed</a> <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/fmfile/0/files/smlouva_STAN_KDU.pdf\">a coalition agreement</a> on April 12, 2017. This agreement was subsequently confirmed, and the coalition agreement approved, by the national congress of the KDU-ČSL on May 27, 2017. At which 228 out of 269 delegates present validly <a href=\"https://kdu.cz/akce/sjezd-2017/aktuality/clanky/celostatni-sjezd-schvalil-koalicni-smlouvu-mezi-kd\">voted</a> for the coalition.</p><p> The coalition cooperation was eventually <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/koalice-kdu-csl-a-stan-se-hrouti-lidovci-vyzvali-starosty-at-jsou-jen-jejich-priveskem-34479\">called off,</a> mainly due to concerns that the coalition&#39;s election results would not reach the 10% threshold required for the group to enter the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> Although the approval of the electoral coalition between STAN and KDU-ČSL for the 2017 elections was not always supported by an overwhelming majority of the membership base, its participation, albeit somewhat limited, in the approval process of their coalition cooperation cannot be denied.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
