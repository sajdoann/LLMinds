This (the second part of the EU x UK agreement, note: Demagog.cz) is highly criticized by some radical opponents of a soft Brexit, because Brexit was built, among other things, on the fact that populists claimed that citizens of countries from the eastern and central parts of the European Union were coming to us and taking jobs from the British. That was not true, but it was used in that campaign.
