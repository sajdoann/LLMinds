    "Please answer TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWABLE about the text's veracity. In addition write a short summary explaining your answer. If the veracity cannot be determined answer UNKNOWABLE. The first sentence in the response should be TRUE. FALSE. or UNKNOWABLE. eg:UNKNOWABLE.",
    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The Czech government actually rejected the Russian accusation, as Brabec claims, and the Russian ambassador was indeed invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We assess the statement as true despite Brabec&#39;s inaccuracy that Minister Stropnický himself negotiated with the Russian ambassador. In reality, it was his deputy Šrámek.</p><p> The government opposed the Russian accusation <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/v-ceske-republice-nebyla-nikdy-vyrabena--vyvijena-ani-skladovana-zadna-latka-typu-novicok-165391/\">in a statement</a> issued after Prime Minister Babiš&#39;s meeting with the directors of the BIS and Military Intelligence. It states, among other things, that:</p><p> <i>&quot;No Novichok-type substance has ever been produced, developed or stored in the Czech Republic. This was stated unanimously by both intelligence services in their reports. In the Czech Republic, a program for the protection of troops and the population and the detection of weapons of mass destruction was launched in 2017. As part of this program, the Novichok A-230 substance was to be tested.</i></p><p> <i>In the first phase, the microsynthesis of the substance Novichok A-230 was carried out. During the microsynthesis, the substance was not isolated and this procedure is not considered production or development according to the methodology of the State Office for Nuclear Safety. The resulting product was immediately destroyed. The second phase of the program was not started. The substance of the Novichok A-230 type is different from the substance A-234, which was used in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom. The two substances are completely different and have a clearly different chemical structure.</i></p><p> Subsequently, as Brabec claims, the Russian ambassador was indeed invited. The Russian ambassador was <a href=\"https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/zive-stropnicky-si-predvolal-ruskeho-velvyslance-proc-moskva/r~272826e22d0e11e89efbac1f6b220ee8/\">informed of the Czech Republic&#39;s reservations</a> regarding Russia&#39;s accusation of producing Novichok (video from 4:57). However, the meeting with the Russian ambassador was not attended by Minister Stropnický, but by his deputy Šrámek (video from 00:10).</p>\nSECTION B: <p>On 17 December 2018, the government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/scripts/modules/fs/icv.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-zpravy/vysledky-jednani-vlady-17--prosince-2018-170824/\">approved</a> a draft law amending Act No. 248/2000 Coll., on the support of regional development, as amended. The draft law was submitted by <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/klara-dostalova-167026/\">the Minister</a> for Regional Development Klára Dostálová. Specifically, it is intended to amend Section 18(8) <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-248#p18-8\">of Act</a> No. 248/2000 Coll., which currently reads as follows: “ <em>The Council for the European Structural and Investment Funds (hereinafter referred to as the “Council”) is hereby established, which is an advisory body to the Government.</em> <strong><em>The Chairman of the Council is the Prime Minister.</em></strong> <em>Its members are representatives of central state administration bodies and representatives of advisory and working bodies of the Government. Details regarding the composition, powers, organization and activities of the Council shall be determined by its statute, which shall be approved by the Government.</em> ”</p><p> The proposed <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNB7JCKHND\">amendment</a> (.docx) states: &quot; <em>In Section 18, paragraph 8, second sentence, of Act No. 248/2000 Coll., on the support of regional development, as amended by Act No. 298/2015 Coll. and Act No. 367/2017 Coll., the word &#39;</em> <em><strong>chairman&#39; is replaced by the word &#39;member&#39;</strong></em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNB7JCKGTJ\">The amendment&#39;s submission report</a> (.docx) also states that, until the amendment enters into force, the Council&#39;s Statute will entrust its presidency to the Executive Vice-Chairman of the Council, i.e. the Minister for Regional Development.</p><p> The current competences of the Council are defined by <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/getmedia/6f1b6426-6d19-486c-9e74-d4099dfd18ae/Statut-Rada-ESIF.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf\">the Statute of the Council</a> (.pdf), adopted by the government resolution of 27 April 2016. According to this document, the Council is an advisory body to the government regarding the coordination of assistance provided from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). According to Article 2, point 2. part c), the Council <em>&quot;discusses the substantive interface and connections between programmes co-financed by the ESI Funds with a focus on ensuring synergistic effects&quot;.</em></p><p> <em>Or</em> , in the words of Minister Brabec, is this body really<em> </em>&quot; <em>recommends systemic solutions to the government, for example in terms of drawing down European funds, or is responsible for the implementation and the relationship between individual programs and the drawing down of funds for individual program objectives.</em> &quot;</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Marek Turčáni mentioned in the statement is <a href=\"https://www.fld.czu.cz/cs/r-6823-o-fakulte\">the Dean of</a> the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Science at the Czech University of Life Sciences. A statement in which Turčáni states what Minister Brabec attributes to him cannot be found in publicly available sources. However, Turčáni has long been dedicated to the issue of Czech forests and the impacts that climate change will have on these forests and the bark beetle living in them ( <a href=\"https://home.czu.cz/turcani/publikace\">see</a> Turčáni&#39;s publication activities).</p><p> In the Czech Television 90&#39; program (broadcast on May 23, 2018), which dealt with the ongoing bark beetle disaster, Turčáni <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/11412378947-90-ct24/218411058130523-kurovcova-kalamita\">states</a> : &quot; <em>At the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Science, we started solving projects funded by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2007 and 2008, where we actually solved some probable development of how the bark beetle here would react to climate change in some way. We published those results in 2011, where it was clear that the bark beetle would increase the number of generations it would produce during the year from two to three. And that is a crucial thing for the negative development.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 21:47)<em> </em>Furthermore, when asked who is to blame, who overslept and did not respond properly to the published warnings, Turčáni answers:<em> </em>&quot; <em>I think it wasn&#39;t a priority at the time because it seemed terribly unlikely to everyone. (...) These results were paid for by the Ministry of Agriculture and of course we provided them all to the Ministry of Agriculture in full. I personally informed Mr. Szorád, the general director of the Forests of the Czech Republic (then director, Demagog.cz note) about this potential danger</em> <strong>.</strong> &quot;<strong><em> </em></strong><em>I suggested to him that we establish joint committees to solve such problems. And Mr. Szorád, the general director, told me that he knew what to do, that he didn&#39;t need any advice.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 23:26) The people of Turčany speak about the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Forests of the Czech Republic.</p><p> In another statement for Czech Television (May 15, 2018), <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1096898594-udalosti-komentare/218411000370515/\">he stated</a> : &quot; <em>I can confirm that it did not happen, because in the spring of 2016 I personally spoke with Minister Jurečka, to whom I emphasized that there was a huge, huge problem with the bark beetle, and I urged him to start solving the situation.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 33:40)<em> </em>This meeting was subsequently confirmed in a video by former Minister Jurečka himself.</p><p> Let us add that Turčáni draws attention in his studies to dangerous factors that can lead to an escalation of the bark beetle disaster. For example, <a href=\"http://lesniportal.cz/downloads/2016/Zprava/Zprava_Final.pdf\">he draws attention</a> to the inappropriate composition of the forest in the Czech Republic (p. 25) and the need to prepare for increasing temperatures and droughts (p. 13, 14). He also <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/11412378947-90-ct24/218411058130523-kurovcova-kalamita\">speaks</a> about the inappropriateness of the current legislation and the insufficient capacities of the Forests of the Czech Republic, which are unable to deal with the ongoing bark beetle disaster (video from 7:45).</p><p> Turčáni has indeed been warning for a long time about the danger of a gradation of the bark beetle crisis. He repeatedly speaks about the shared responsibility of both the Ministry of Agriculture and the Forests of the Czech Republic.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Simply put, Brabec says in his statement that according to experts, spruce thrives in a wetter climate than a drier one, and that all experts claim this today. This corresponds to our research in the professional literature. We have reviewed several studies, in which, for example, the following formulations are found:</p><p> &quot; <em>Wiping and dying are affecting spruce stands of all ages, both artificially established and naturally regenerated. The mechanism of damage is not described in detail, but its basic cause is fluctuations in meteorological conditions, which can be linked to ongoing global climate change. The triggering mechanism of catastrophic damage is recurring periods of drought.</em> &quot; (V. Šrámek and K. Neudertová Hellebrandová, VULHM, p. 305, <a href=\"http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/ZLV/fulltext/469.pdf\">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>Spring and summer drought episodes are demonstrably not only a factor limiting plant growth, but also a significant predisposing stressor. Drought increases sensitivity to some biotic diseases (in particular, a higher incidence of vascular mycoses and diseases of the assimilation apparatus can be expected) and also increases the threat from insect pests.</em> &quot; (P. Čermák, VULHM, p. 9, <a href=\"http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/Sbornik_Budisov_2014_final_komp.pdf#page=11\">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>The most vulnerable point in the stability of spruce stands growing in the Czech Republic in lower forest vegetation stages (in the 5th to 3rd LVS) is the disruption of its moisture balance with a direct impact on the soil moisture regime and water reserves in the soil.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(P. Hadaš, LDF MZLU, <a href=\"http://cbks.cz/sbornik05b/Hadas2.pdf\">here</a> ).</p><p> In the studies we searched for, it is repeatedly stated that drought is a threatening factor for the growth of spruce trees. It is not in our power to determine whether all experts claim this, as Brabec says. However, the fact is that we were unable to find a study that would claim the opposite.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
