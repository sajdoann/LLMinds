I remember, if I&#39;m not mistaken, sometime in October or September 2017, Minister of Agriculture Jureček presented the government with material that he basically put on the table, it was only a few pages and said that a bark beetle disaster was approaching or that there was a real one. The government then more or less said yes, and set out some further course of action.
