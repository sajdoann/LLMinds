    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>According to the Competence <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1969-2#p19-2\">Act,</a> the Ministry of the Environment is the central state administration body for nature and landscape protection and forestry in national parks. The Nature and Landscape Protection Act specifies the scope of the Ministry of the Environment and makes it responsible for <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-114#p79-3-j\">approving</a> the principles of care for national parks and <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-114#p79-3-d\">issuing</a> consent for the use of provisions on pest control.</p><p> The bark beetle disaster in Šumava has its own history. It was particularly <a href=\"https://prachaticky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/jak-vypada-sumava-11-let-po-orkanu-kyrill-a-nasledne-kurovcove-gradaci-20180526.html\">evident</a> in the five years after Hurricane <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2017945-deset-let-po-orkanu-kyrill-lesy-se-vzpamatovavaji-silnemu-vetru-ale-podlehly-znovu\">Kyrill</a> , which significantly damaged the face of Šumava in 2007. <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/na-sumave-se-ma-omezit-kaceni-stromu-priroda-si-podle-odborn/r~df5c9dc462e011e5b605002590604f2e/\">Originally,</a> a large number of dead trees were cut down and the state tried to actively support the regeneration of forests. Since 2015, a policy <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/problem-s-kurovcem-ma-clovek-ne-priroda-lesy-se-obnovi-samy-zni-z-sumavy-48830\">of non-intervention</a> has been promoted, because the opinions that forests are capable of regeneration on their own, without human intervention, are still strengthening.</p><p> The issue of the bark beetle in the Šumava Mountains was discussed on the political scene, especially in 2010–2011, when the bark beetle <a href=\"http://www.lesmedium.sk/casopis-letokruhy/2016/casopis-letokruhy-2016-12/zkusenosti-z-kurovcove-kalamity-v-np-sumava\">affected</a> the Šumava Mountains the most. The political <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/240693-kurovec-nahlodal-i-cssd-sobotka-brani-ekology-zimola-kritizuje.html\">discussion</a> mainly concerned the issue of felling dead trees, when the biggest <a href=\"https://www.cssd.cz/aktualne/aktuality/zimola-kurovec-neni-levicak-ani-pravicak/\">critic</a> of the policy of &quot;leaving the forests alone&quot; was the South Bohemian Governor Jiří Zimola.</p><p> However, the claim that the Šumava National Park was not affected by the bark beetle disaster is false. As follows from <a href=\"http://www.lesmedium.sk/casopis-letokruhy/2016/casopis-letokruhy-2016-12/zkusenosti-z-kurovcove-kalamity-v-np-sumava\">the analysis of</a> Martin Klewar from the Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Šumava National Park was hit by the bark beetle disaster: &quot; <em>The disaster reached its peak in 2010 and 2011, when in one year 261,220 trees (2010) and 340,700 trees (2011) died due to the bark beetle in the non-intervention areas of the Šumava National Park, and within the intervention areas, bark beetle wood with a volume of 347,000 m3 (2010) and 242,000 m3 (2011) was harvested. The weight of the attacked trees oscillates between 0.33–6.5 m3 with a mean value of 0.99 m3. The annual increase in bark beetle infestations creates continuous areas in places exceeding a hundred hectares (Trojmezná, Poledník).</em> &quot;</p><p> The bark beetle disaster does not only affect Šumava, but is also <a href=\"http://www.kurovcoveinfo.cz/\">widespread</a> in other parts of the Czech Republic, for example in <a href=\"https://zpravy.idnes.cz/kde-je-smrk-tam-je-kurovec-kazdy-ale-proti-nemu-bojuje-jinak-poz-/domaci.aspx?c=A110802_152122_domaci_taj\">the Jesenické region</a> . As stated by F. Lorenz, M. Knížek and J. Liška (2017): &quot; <em>The most serious, literally critical situation, has persisted for many years in the area of northern and central Moravia and Silesia. The Moravian-Silesian region (approx. 1.46 million m3) and the Olomouc region (approx. 0.64 million m3) are particularly catastrophically affected (in both regions approximately 2/3 of the national bark beetle volume is again recorded)! Other significantly affected regions include South Bohemia (approx. 352 thousand m3), Plzeň (approx. 285 thousand m3), Vysočina (approx. 260 thousand m3), Zlín (approx. 233 thousand m3) and South Moravia (approx. 228 thousand m3).&quot;</em> (p. 13)</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Simply put, Brabec says in his statement that according to experts, spruce thrives in a wetter climate than a drier one, and that all experts claim this today. This corresponds to our research in the professional literature. We have reviewed several studies, in which, for example, the following formulations are found:</p><p> &quot; <em>Wiping and dying are affecting spruce stands of all ages, both artificially established and naturally regenerated. The mechanism of damage is not described in detail, but its basic cause is fluctuations in meteorological conditions, which can be linked to ongoing global climate change. The triggering mechanism of catastrophic damage is recurring periods of drought.</em> &quot; (V. Šrámek and K. Neudertová Hellebrandová, VULHM, p. 305, <a href=\"http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/ZLV/fulltext/469.pdf\">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>Spring and summer drought episodes are demonstrably not only a factor limiting plant growth, but also a significant predisposing stressor. Drought increases sensitivity to some biotic diseases (in particular, a higher incidence of vascular mycoses and diseases of the assimilation apparatus can be expected) and also increases the threat from insect pests.</em> &quot; (P. Čermák, VULHM, p. 9, <a href=\"http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/Sbornik_Budisov_2014_final_komp.pdf#page=11\">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>The most vulnerable point in the stability of spruce stands growing in the Czech Republic in lower forest vegetation stages (in the 5th to 3rd LVS) is the disruption of its moisture balance with a direct impact on the soil moisture regime and water reserves in the soil.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(P. Hadaš, LDF MZLU, <a href=\"http://cbks.cz/sbornik05b/Hadas2.pdf\">here</a> ).</p><p> In the studies we searched for, it is repeatedly stated that drought is a threatening factor for the growth of spruce trees. It is not in our power to determine whether all experts claim this, as Brabec says. However, the fact is that we were unable to find a study that would claim the opposite.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>We are unable to confirm the veracity of this statement, as this document could not be found. From the mentioned date, there is only <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIAAS29YQ74\">a government resolution</a> of September 25, 2017, in which the government takes note of the Information on resolving the current situation in forestry.</p><p><br/><br/></p>\nSECTION D: <p>Marek Turčáni mentioned in the statement is <a href=\"https://www.fld.czu.cz/cs/r-6823-o-fakulte\">the Dean of</a> the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Science at the Czech University of Life Sciences. A statement in which Turčáni states what Minister Brabec attributes to him cannot be found in publicly available sources. However, Turčáni has long been dedicated to the issue of Czech forests and the impacts that climate change will have on these forests and the bark beetle living in them ( <a href=\"https://home.czu.cz/turcani/publikace\">see</a> Turčáni&#39;s publication activities).</p><p> In the Czech Television 90&#39; program (broadcast on May 23, 2018), which dealt with the ongoing bark beetle disaster, Turčáni <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/11412378947-90-ct24/218411058130523-kurovcova-kalamita\">states</a> : &quot; <em>At the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Science, we started solving projects funded by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2007 and 2008, where we actually solved some probable development of how the bark beetle here would react to climate change in some way. We published those results in 2011, where it was clear that the bark beetle would increase the number of generations it would produce during the year from two to three. And that is a crucial thing for the negative development.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 21:47)<em> </em>Furthermore, when asked who is to blame, who overslept and did not respond properly to the published warnings, Turčáni answers:<em> </em>&quot; <em>I think it wasn&#39;t a priority at the time because it seemed terribly unlikely to everyone. (...) These results were paid for by the Ministry of Agriculture and of course we provided them all to the Ministry of Agriculture in full. I personally informed Mr. Szorád, the general director of the Forests of the Czech Republic (then director, Demagog.cz note) about this potential danger</em> <strong>.</strong> &quot;<strong><em> </em></strong><em>I suggested to him that we establish joint committees to solve such problems. And Mr. Szorád, the general director, told me that he knew what to do, that he didn&#39;t need any advice.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 23:26) The people of Turčany speak about the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Forests of the Czech Republic.</p><p> In another statement for Czech Television (May 15, 2018), <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1096898594-udalosti-komentare/218411000370515/\">he stated</a> : &quot; <em>I can confirm that it did not happen, because in the spring of 2016 I personally spoke with Minister Jurečka, to whom I emphasized that there was a huge, huge problem with the bark beetle, and I urged him to start solving the situation.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 33:40)<em> </em>This meeting was subsequently confirmed in a video by former Minister Jurečka himself.</p><p> Let us add that Turčáni draws attention in his studies to dangerous factors that can lead to an escalation of the bark beetle disaster. For example, <a href=\"http://lesniportal.cz/downloads/2016/Zprava/Zprava_Final.pdf\">he draws attention</a> to the inappropriate composition of the forest in the Czech Republic (p. 25) and the need to prepare for increasing temperatures and droughts (p. 13, 14). He also <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/11412378947-90-ct24/218411058130523-kurovcova-kalamita\">speaks</a> about the inappropriateness of the current legislation and the insufficient capacities of the Forests of the Czech Republic, which are unable to deal with the ongoing bark beetle disaster (video from 7:45).</p><p> Turčáni has indeed been warning for a long time about the danger of a gradation of the bark beetle crisis. He repeatedly speaks about the shared responsibility of both the Ministry of Agriculture and the Forests of the Czech Republic.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>On 17 December 2018, the government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/scripts/modules/fs/icv.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-zpravy/vysledky-jednani-vlady-17--prosince-2018-170824/\">approved</a> a draft law amending Act No. 248/2000 Coll., on the support of regional development, as amended. The draft law was submitted by <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/klara-dostalova-167026/\">the Minister</a> for Regional Development Klára Dostálová. Specifically, it is intended to amend Section 18(8) <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-248#p18-8\">of Act</a> No. 248/2000 Coll., which currently reads as follows: “ <em>The Council for the European Structural and Investment Funds (hereinafter referred to as the “Council”) is hereby established, which is an advisory body to the Government.</em> <strong><em>The Chairman of the Council is the Prime Minister.</em></strong> <em>Its members are representatives of central state administration bodies and representatives of advisory and working bodies of the Government. Details regarding the composition, powers, organization and activities of the Council shall be determined by its statute, which shall be approved by the Government.</em> ”</p><p> The proposed <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNB7JCKHND\">amendment</a> (.docx) states: &quot; <em>In Section 18, paragraph 8, second sentence, of Act No. 248/2000 Coll., on the support of regional development, as amended by Act No. 298/2015 Coll. and Act No. 367/2017 Coll., the word &#39;</em> <em><strong>chairman&#39; is replaced by the word &#39;member&#39;</strong></em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNB7JCKGTJ\">The amendment&#39;s submission report</a> (.docx) also states that, until the amendment enters into force, the Council&#39;s Statute will entrust its presidency to the Executive Vice-Chairman of the Council, i.e. the Minister for Regional Development.</p><p> The current competences of the Council are defined by <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/getmedia/6f1b6426-6d19-486c-9e74-d4099dfd18ae/Statut-Rada-ESIF.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf\">the Statute of the Council</a> (.pdf), adopted by the government resolution of 27 April 2016. According to this document, the Council is an advisory body to the government regarding the coordination of assistance provided from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). According to Article 2, point 2. part c), the Council <em>&quot;discusses the substantive interface and connections between programmes co-financed by the ESI Funds with a focus on ensuring synergistic effects&quot;.</em></p><p> <em>Or</em> , in the words of Minister Brabec, is this body really<em> </em>&quot; <em>recommends systemic solutions to the government, for example in terms of drawing down European funds, or is responsible for the implementation and the relationship between individual programs and the drawing down of funds for individual program objectives.</em> &quot;</p>\nSECTION F: <p>The Czech Environmental Inspectorate carries out <a href=\"http://www.cizp.cz/file/mj8/vyrocni-zprava-CIZP-2017.pdf\">inspections</a> every year for the purpose of forest protection, focusing, among other things, on the restoration of forest stands, damage during forest activities (e.g. logging), wildlife, protection of forest soil, and also on bark beetle infestation of forest stands (p. 74).</p><p> The Czech Environmental Inspectorate regularly deals with bark beetles in its annual reports. The annual report for <a href=\"http://www.cizp.cz/file/wm3/vyrocni-zprava.pdf\">2014</a> states that “ <em>the situation is serious in the jurisdiction of the municipalities with extended jurisdiction of Hranice, Lipník nad Bečvou, Olomouc, Šternberk and Zábřeh in the Olomouc Region. On the other hand, the state of insect pests in the Šumava National Park can be assessed positively, where the situation is more favorable compared to previous years.</em> ” (p. 57). In <a href=\"http://www.cizp.cz/file/kx3/Vyrocni-zprava-CIZP-2015-final.pdf\">2015</a> , there was further development of bark beetles in the same area (according to the CEI, the situation is serious), but “ <em>the state of insect pests in the Šumava National Park can be assessed positively, where the situation is more favorable compared to previous years, but an increase in bark beetle wood can realistically be expected as a result of the enormous drought in 2015.</em> ”<em> </em>(p. 69).</p><p> In its <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/sites/default/files/1904048-vz-cizp-2016.pdf\">2016</a> annual report, the CEI stated that the bark beetle situation in the Šumava National Park “ <em>has improved significantly compared to 2010 and 2011</em> ” (p. 66). On the other hand, the phenomenon of spruce dying due to lack of moisture and bark beetle infestation in Central and Northern Moravia has been a major phenomenon in recent years, according to the CEI. “ <em>The current capacities of forest protection authorities do not allow for an adequate and comprehensive response to the situation, even when aware that these are primarily tasks for forest owners, professional forest managers and the state forest administration in accordance with the Forest Act</em> ” (p. 68).</p><p> In <a href=\"http://www.cizp.cz/file/mj8/vyrocni-zprava-CIZP-2017.pdf\">2017</a> , there was a slight increase in the occurrence of bark beetles and the volume of bark beetle harvesting in the Šumava National Park (p. 76). “ <em>The disastrous situation in the development of bark beetles in the Moravian-Silesian Region, the Olomouc Region and the Zlín Region is repeatedly unfavorable for 2018, where, due to drought and Wenceslas disease, the very essence of the forest is often threatened.</em> ” In the Olomouc Region, “ <em>according to the CEI, common defensive measures (traps, traps) are not effective. The situation is also worsened by the decrease in wood prices and the associated decrease in interest in bark beetle wood.</em> ”<em> </em>(pp. 73–74).</p><p> Given that more detailed information on the control of bark beetle interventions is not available, we assess the statement as unverifiable. It is not possible to clearly determine from the annual reports of the Czech Environmental Protection Agency whether the conclusions contained in them on the bark beetle situation indicate that the situation would not be manageable or not.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
