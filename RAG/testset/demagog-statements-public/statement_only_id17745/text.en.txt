We have carried out hundreds of specific inspections as the Czech Environmental Inspectorate to ensure compliance with the Forest Act and measures against bark beetles. There were some conclusions from those inspections, I must say that until about 2017 there were no catastrophic conclusions of the type that they would, that they would not be able to handle those things.
