In my opinion, the Ministry of Agriculture has now proposed a very sensible step, to make a so-called regionalization within the framework of the Forest Act, to divide the Czech Republic into three zones. A zone where, let&#39;s say, there is no point in fighting anymore, because the fight has already been won there, that is, there is no point in cutting down the so-called abandoned lands, where the bark beetle is no longer harmful, because it has simply flown away from there.
