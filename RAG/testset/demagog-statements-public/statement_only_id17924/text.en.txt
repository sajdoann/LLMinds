So I have problems with compulsory voting. I&#39;ll ignore the stupid argument that the communists introduced it. By the way, you know, right? On the contrary, they abolished Masaryk&#39;s law on compulsory voting and formally and only formally, voting was not compulsory. But something else is that under the communists, voting was enforced quite drastically, although not by law.
