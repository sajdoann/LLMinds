On April 24, a petition demanding Stanek&#39;s dismissal was created, and on April 28, the vice-chairman of the ČSSD Onderka began demanding the dismissal of his own minister, contrary to the position of his own chairman. On May 2, I received the petition signatories at the Government Office, and Mr. Hamáček, who stood up for Stanek, was also at the meeting with them.
