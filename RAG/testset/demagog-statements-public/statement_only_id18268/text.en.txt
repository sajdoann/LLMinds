He (Milo≈° Zeman, note: Demagog.cz) was known to Mr. Sobotka, who first went to the president with the nomination of Mr. Prouza to head the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and when he told Sobotka that he would never appoint Prouza, he came up with another name and did not even propose Prouza. It was the same with my dismissal, which he did not push through, so I resigned myself.
