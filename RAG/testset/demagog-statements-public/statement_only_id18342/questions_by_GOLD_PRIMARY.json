    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>In his statement, Fiala draws attention to the different positions of the last two foreign ministers, Hamáček and Petříček, on the Global Compact on Migration.</p><p> Jan Hamáček defended the adoption of this document during the discussion in <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/019schuz/bqbs/b20417001.htm\">the Chamber of Deputies</a> , stating, among other things: &quot; <em>I will try to explain to the chairman of the ODS club why it is good to have this document, even if it is non-binding.&quot;</em></p><p> His successor, Petříček, however, takes the opposite position. In his <a href=\"https://www.cssd.cz/aktualne/aktuality/vyjadreni-ministra-zahranicnich-veci-k-rozhodnuti-vlady-ze-cr-nepristoupi-ke-globalnimu-paktu/\">statement</a> on the Global Compact, for example, he states: &quot; <em>We should therefore withdraw from the compact negotiation process, as the United States, Hungary and Austria did.&quot;</em></p><p> So Fiala is right: both ministers had different positions on the Global Compact, which is why we consider the statement to be true.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>In Kladno, after gaining <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=1&amp;xdz=8&amp;xnumnuts=2103&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=0\">202,233 votes</a> , the Volba pro Kladno party won, as in 2014. It thus won 13 seats in the council, which has a total of 33 members. The party will nevertheless eventually head to the opposition. The parties ODS, SPD, ANO and the Kladeňáci movement <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/volby/volby-2018-komunalni-volby-volba-pro-kladno-opozice_1810071733_dbr\">have agreed</a> to cooperate, and according to the coalition agreement, Dan Jiránek (ODS), who has already led the city in the past, is to be the mayor.</p><p> Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://volby.idnes.cz/kladno-koalice-ods-spd-top-09-hrozba-vylouceni-ze-strany-pip-/volby.aspx?c=A181008_121958_volby_kop\">stated</a> through a press spokesman that the situation in Kladno &quot; <em>is not entirely standard.</em> &quot; And further: &quot; <em>As far as I know, the campaign in Kladno was very heated, accompanied by massive anonymous attacks on the opposition.</em> &quot; ODS deputy chairman Martin Kupka also pointed out the heated nature of the election campaign and <a href=\"https://volby.idnes.cz/kladno-koalice-ods-spd-top-09-hrozba-vylouceni-ze-strany-pip-/volby.aspx?c=A181008_121958_volby_kop\">said</a> about cooperation with the SPD: <em>&quot;It is a coalition that I do not prefer, but I understand the arguments that my colleagues</em> (from the Kladno ODS, note: Demagog.cz) <em>presented to the ODS</em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> However, not every party leadership is as tolerant of the formation of a coalition with the SPD as the ODS leadership. <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/okamura-se-raduje-ods-a-top-09-pomohly-jeho-strane-k-vladnou/r~9a3f8512cab611e8b634ac1f6b220ee8/?redirected=1542212809\">Petr Hašek</a> , a member of TOP 09 and also a member of the Kladeňáci movement, was faced with the choice of either leaving the coalition or the party. In the end, he decided on the latter option.</p><p> The aforementioned escalation of the campaign in Kladno can be proven by the post-election <a href=\"https://kladensky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/povolebni-boj-pokracuje-v-kladne-se-mnozi-trestni-oznameni-20181010.html\">developments</a> . Criminal charges were filed by both the old-new mayor Dan Jiránek from the ODS and representatives of the former mayor Milan Volf (Volba pro Kladno). However, we were unable to find any concrete evidence that would illustrate the escalation of the campaign, nor any credible information about the spreaders of defamatory news.</p><p> Kladno is not the only city where the ODS cell deviated from its preferred line; in other cases, however, it is primarily about cooperation with the KSČM. In <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xdz=2&amp;xnumnuts=7104&amp;xobec=513750&amp;xstat=0&amp;xvyber=0\">Hranice,</a> a broad coalition (or rather a &quot; <em>working</em> <a href=\"https://olomouc.idnes.cz/hranice-siroka-koalice-zastupitelstvo-funkce-kritika-opozice-tajemnik-rezignace-gip-/olomouc-zpravy.aspx?c=A181109_438556_olomouc-zpravy_stk\"><em>group</em></a> <em>aimed at developing the city</em> &quot;) was formed of seven parties and movements that made it to the council. These are ANO, the association Our Beautiful Hranice, Hranice for Life, Hranice 2000, the communists, the ODS with the support of the Free Democrats, and the SPD. In response to <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/218411030501104#t=4m38s\">criticism</a> (video, 4:41) of cooperation with the KSČM, the six-member local ODS council in Hranice <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/mistnim-sdruzenim-ods-ktere-spolupracuji-s-kscm-hrozi-zruseni/1683221\">resigned</a> , and the Regional Council <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2644691-hranicka-ods-ma-prijit-o-licenci-duvodem-je-zakazana-povolebni-spoluprace-s\">proposed</a> revoking the license of the local ODS association in Hranice. Given that the ODS is resolving the coalition in Hranice (although more in connection with cooperation with the KSČM, which regional cells are prohibited from doing), Kladno remains the only tolerated city with a coalition with the SPD.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>At the outset, it should be clarified that Chairman Fiala is talking about <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236\">Act</a> No. 236/1995 Coll. (abbreviated as the salary of constitutional officials). The so-called <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236#p3-3\">automaton</a> , or linking the salary of constitutional officials to the state of the economy, is reflected in the determination of a certain <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236#p8-1\">coefficient</a> by which the so-called salary base is multiplied. This is 2.75 times the &quot; <em>average nominal monthly salary of natural persons in the non-business sphere achieved according to published data from the Czech Statistical Office for the calendar year before last</em> &quot; <em>.</em> In other words, for 2019, the salary base is calculated as 2.75 times the average monthly salary for 2017 and determined by the communication of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.</p><p> The above-described machine itself was already part of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2002-309#cast33\">Act</a> No. 309/2002 Coll., on amendments to laws related to the adoption of the Act on the Service of Civil Servants in Administrative Offices. At that time, the salary base for representatives designated by the Act was to be three times the average monthly wage for the year before last. The purpose of this establishment was actually <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=28676\">to establish</a> a &quot; <em>stable link between the salaries of constitutional officials and the development of wages in the non-business sphere</em> &quot; (.doc, p. 36). The procedural history of this provision then consisted primarily in the several postponements of the effectiveness of this act or the annulment of individual provisions of the Act on the Salary of Constitutional Officials by the Constitutional Court. The final <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359\">amendment</a> to Act No. 359/2014 Coll. from 2014 <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=191422&amp;pdf=1\">comes</a> (.pdf) from the pen of Jan Hamáček, the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. The original government proposal (Bohuslav Sobotka&#39;s government) <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=110647\">envisaged</a> (.pdf) a fixed salary of CZK 52,248 for the next four years, and in the end, Hamáček&#39;s amendment was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=7&amp;t=277\">accepted</a> instead.</p><p> The new salary range was thus determined by determining a new <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359#f5469272\">multiple</a> for deputies (2.75) and a special multiple for judges (3.00). Given the difference between the fixed amount for 2014 and the amount given by the multiple in 2015, Hamáček&#39;s proposal <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359#f5469273\">provided for</a> a gradual annual increase in the multiple over four years. The salary base should thus reach 2.5 times the average wage for the year before last in 2018.</p><p> Petr Fiala and the entire ODS did not vote for either Hamáček&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=60088\">amendment</a> or the final wording <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=60089\">of the law</a> . The majority abstained, and in the second vote two deputies were against. Therefore, the expression &quot; <em>we agreed</em> &quot; used by Chairman Fiala in his statement is somewhat questionable.</p><p> As for the meaning of the statement about &quot; <em>creating a solution that we will not have to return to</em> &quot;, the amendment may directly imply an effort after 2018 (when the salary was calculated by a multiple of 2.5) to immediately jump to calculating with a multiple of 2.75 in the following year. According to <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2643791-pirati-a-spd-pozadali-o-schuzi-snemovny-k-platum-bude-asi-16-listopadu\">data</a> from Czech Television (infobox note), however, such a procedure would cause the salary of a deputy and senator to increase by 14,700 CZK. The government, which proposed <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=167\">an amendment</a> to the Act on the Salaries of Constitutional Officials, is probably aware of this. It <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135103\">should</a> (.pdf, p. 3) permanently reduce the multiple for the calculation back to 2.5 and also change the average that will be multiplied.</p><p> It was also the ODS&#39;s votes that moved the proposal from the first reading to committees, which means that the Chamber of Deputies, including the ODS, will consider this proposal and will return to addressing the salaries of MPs, thanks to the ODS.</p><p> To summarize the assessment, the timing of the adoption of the amendment is appropriate, but the intention not to return to discussing salaries does not follow from the ODS&#39;s vote so far, which concerns the new government draft amendment (the discussion <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/022schuz/22-1.html\">took place</a> on November 15, 2018).</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Fiala refers to the political mistake in the statement as coalition cooperation with the KSČM. The ODS banned such a form of cooperation by adopting <a href=\"https://docplayer.cz/9878146-Xvii-kongres-ods-xvii-kongres-ods-18-19-11-2006-praha.html\">a resolution</a> (p. 120) at the 17th Congress in 2006: <em>&quot;The ODS Congress orders the ODS Executive Board to revoke the licenses of local associations that cooperate in coalition with the KSČM at the municipal level.&quot;</em></p><p> The ODS <a href=\"https://moje.ods.cz/stanovy#clanek3\">statutes</a> state in Article 3, point 7, part f) on termination of membership: &quot; <em>Membership in the party terminates: by cancellation of membership by the local assembly or executive board due to a serious breach of obligations set out in section 3.14 of the statutes or due to a final conviction of a member for an intentional crime.&quot;</em> Further in point g): <em>&quot;if the local association terminates and the member does not submit an application for re-registration to another local association within three months of termination.&quot;</em></p><p> In Article 7, point 3, part f), the statutes state that the Executive Board&#39;s powers are &quot; <em>to decide on the establishment (by granting a license) and the dissolution (by revoking a license) of local associations&quot;.</em> In part h), it adds &quot; <em>to decide on the dissolution of membership pursuant to clause 3.7, letter f) of the statutes.&quot;</em></p><p> The Executive Board has decided to revoke the licenses of local associations in connection with cooperation with the KSČM several times. In <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1282064-ods-zrusila-18-sdruzeni-kvuli-spolupraci-s-kscm\">2011</a> , the licenses of 18 local associations were revoked. <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1290728-ods-hodla-kvuli-koalicim-s-kscm-zrusit-az-30-sdruzeni\"></a> There were <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1290728-ods-hodla-kvuli-koalicim-s-kscm-zrusit-az-30-sdruzeni\">30</a> local cells that were threatened with having their licenses revoked due to their coalition with the KSČM in 2011. One of the dissolved local associations was the organization in Rychnov nad Kněžnou. However, as <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/zakaz-koalic-s-komunisty-ods-nepomohl-mesta-ho-porusuji/r~4464b4d4560511e49bec0025900fea04/?redirected=1533021181\">the Aktuálně.cz</a> server found out, the cell there eventually reached an agreement with the party leadership and kept its license. This was despite the fact that the ODS members in Rychnov continued to form a coalition with the KSČM. For example, in Týnec nad Sázavou, the party cell was actually dissolved and the representatives continued to exercise their mandate as independents. At the same time, there are known cases where ODS members who entered a coalition with the communists at the local level announced their withdrawal from the ODS and decided to continue in the coalition as independents. This happened, for example, in <a href=\"https://vary.idnes.cz/starostove-kterym-zrusili-sdruzeni-chteji-opustit-ods-p2j-/vary-zpravy.aspx?c=A110301_095926_vary-zpravy_sou\">Aš and Březová</a> .</p><p> The ODS Executive Board dealt with the revocation of licenses from local cells due to coalition cooperation with the KSČM, for example, in 2007, when, according to the <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vykonna-rada-ods-resi-spolupraci-strany-s-komunisty-na-komunalni-urovni_200703312105_mmatusu\">iRozhlas.cz</a> server, two licenses were revoked in the Olomouc region. Thus, licenses are revoked from party cells in the event of non-compliance with the resolution from the 17th Congress prohibiting cooperation with the KSČM, although in some cases the license was ultimately not revoked.</p><p></p>\nSECTION E: <p>Fiala speaks about two things in his statement. According to him, the Global Compact on Migration is a vague document and ceases to distinguish between legal and illegal migration. As a second fact, he states that the same objections to this document are heard from other European countries. We do not take the phrase “most European countries” literally, but only verify whether these views appear in a larger number of countries.</p><p> <a href=\"https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/sites/default/files/180713_agreed_outcome_global_compact_for_migration.pdf\">The Global Compact</a> states that this document is not legally binding (p. 2, point 7). This is a declaration that does not contain any sanctions, and this type of document contains general principles rather than specific commitments.</p><p> As for the distinction between legal and illegal migration, the Covenant allows states to do so. “ <em>States may distinguish between legal and illegal migration status (...)</em> ” (paragraph 15, p. 4). However, it is a fact that in some points of the document the distinction between these statuses is no longer made. It is best to show this by example. For example, the signatories to the agreement declare in it (paragraph 13 h, p. 21) that they want to “ <em>protect and respect the rights and best interests of the child at all times, regardless of their migration status, by ensuring the availability of viable alternatives to detention in detention facilities. Priority is given to community-based care, ensuring access to education and health care, and respecting the right of children to family life and family unity (...)</em> ”.<em> </em>According to this point, it should not matter to states whether a child entered the country legally or illegally. What matters is the best interests of the child and states should treat both types of child migrants equally.</p><p> Now to the very core of our assessment, namely the question of whether similar objections to those of the ODS leader are also being raised in other European countries.</p><p> Looking at neighboring <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/2638163-viden-neprijme-globalni-pakt-osn-o-migraci-odmitame-spojovat-ochranu-s-ekonomickou\">Austria</a> , for example, Austrian Chancellor Kurz announced that his country would not join the Global Compact. He stated that the Global Compact does not help to solve migration issues, threatens Austrian sovereignty in matters of migration policy, and blurs the distinction between legal and illegal migration. Austria also raised <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-migrants-austria/austria-has-concerns-about-u-n-migration-pact-might-back-out-idUSKCN1MK2EJ\">doubts about the interpretation of</a> certain passages, for example whether the compact can be interpreted as a provision on migration as a human right.</p><p> <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/polsky-ministr-vnitra-chce-odstoupit-od-globalni-dohody-osn/r~12457374cbdd11e8b295ac1f6b220ee8/\">Poland</a> has also announced its intention not to join the Global Compact. Polish Interior Minister Brudzinski stated that the reasons for this step were that &quot; <em>in our opinion, the draft agreement does not guarantee Poland&#39;s security. Moreover, it may increase illegal migration</em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> The document is also being discussed in <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/488421-migracni-pakt-se-prici-i-casti-cdu-angely-merkelove.html\">Germany</a> . The opposition AfD party, for example, is against its adoption, but there are also critical voices from the ruling CDU/CSU. For example, MP Wendt is concerned about the lack of distinction between refugees and labor migration, while his colleague Mitsch is concerned that the Global Pact &quot; <em>will curtail Germany&#39;s sovereignty in migration issues</em> .&quot;</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2018/11/13/global-compact-for-migration-sound-and-fury/#77b11fd1297a\">Doubts</a> about the interpretation were also voiced in <a href=\"https://news.err.ee/876709/estonia-200-political-declaration-must-be-added-to-migration-compact\">Estonia</a> , where some political parties demanded that the government clarify the country&#39;s political position, i.e. prevent abuse of the ambiguous pact. <a href=\"https://domov.sme.sk/c/20954985/sns-pakt-o-migracii-osn-parlament-narodna-rada.html\">The Slovak discussion</a> then shows the uncertainty of individual parties and politicians regarding how the Pact can be understood and what obligations it brings to the signatories.</p><p></p>\nSECTION F: <p>In the parliamentary elections in 2013, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">384,174</a> votes, and in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">572,948</a> , or 49% more. This number fits within our tolerance of 10% deviation. In percentage terms, it was 7.72% and 11.32% of the votes, respectively. At the same time, the party received 56.25% more seats ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">25</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">16</a> ). </p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-69s2T\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/69s2T/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"273\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20161007&amp;xv=2\">2016</a> Senate elections, the party won only two mandates, compared to 9 in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005\">2018.</a> In the 2018 elections, it also <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/volby/senat?k=2&amp;t=uspesnost-stran\">defended</a> only 4 mandates. So, ODS is also succeeding in fulfilling this goal in the Senate elections. Moreover, ODS won in the last Senate elections, as Petr Fiala further claims. In <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=2\">2018</a> , ODS candidates won a total of 9 mandates in 27 constituencies. Candidates for the second most successful party, STAN, won only 3 mandates.</p><p> In the European Parliament elections, the party has also managed to meet the 50% growth target, and even significantly exceeded it. In 2014, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> votes, and in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , an increase of 196%. At the same time, the party received almost double the percentage of votes in 2018 ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">14.54%</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">7.67%</a> in 2014). The number of seats won by ODS doubled from two in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> to four in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">the last</a> elections. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the European Parliament elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ebPAZ\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ebPAZ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"290\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the context of the European elections, the part about second place, doubling the number of mandates and tripling the number of votes is also true. In the last EP elections, ODS indeed finished <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep?xjazyk=CZ\">second</a> behind the ANO movement. In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> elections, the party won 2 mandates, while in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">this year&#39;s</a> elections it won 4. The number of votes from 2014 is <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> , and from 2019 it was <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , which is approximately 2.96 times more.</p><p> In the elections to city and municipal councils, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9,178,453 votes in 2014.

The result thus exceeds the target set by Fiala by 1,138,147 votes. In percentage terms, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9.26% of the votes in 2014, and 13.56% in <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">the following</a> elections. It therefore received 0.33% less than the commitment assumes. However, the result fits within our 10% tolerance. The party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 2,398 mandates in 2014, which is 3.86%. In <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">2018</a> , it received 2,600, or 4.2%. It is therefore clear that the party did not meet this Fiala target in terms of the number of mandates in the municipal elections. However, even in these elections, the commitment was fulfilled in two of the three possible calculation methods (absolute number of votes and percentage of votes), therefore we evaluate the statement as a whole as true. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in municipal elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-jUB4F\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jUB4F/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"277\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
