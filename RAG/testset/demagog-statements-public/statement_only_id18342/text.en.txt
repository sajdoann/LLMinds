I set a goal for us (ODS, note: Demagog.cz) to always have 50% more in every election in the same type of election, which is no small ambition, we are doing well, in the last European elections we even exceeded that, when I look at the last elections that were held here, municipal, senate, we significantly strengthened, we clearly won in the senate elections, when I look at the European elections, we were second, we doubled the number of mandates, we tripled the number of votes.
