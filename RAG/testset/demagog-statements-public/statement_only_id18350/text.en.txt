It was not easy for ODS, as a strong party and a long-term traditional party in the Czech political system, not to field a candidate in all 27 districts, and we did it anyway, we did not field one, sometimes we made an agreement, we supported someone else, and what did it ultimately lead to, weakening ODS? No, strengthening it. We won the Senate elections by a landslide.
