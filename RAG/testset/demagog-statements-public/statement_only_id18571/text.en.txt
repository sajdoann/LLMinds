I did not notice any questions about stopping the criminal prosecution of the Prime Minister at the official meetings I attended in the European Parliament. I was not contacted, except by Den√≠k N, about this question. (...) So far, at those official meetings, and it was actually a meeting in Strasbourg and this week in Brussels, no one asked me about it and it was not part of the official meetings.
