I have already initiated the re-establishment of the Disability Intergroup, which is a group for people with disabilities. I have obtained the signatures of several dozen colleagues from all factions. All committees are represented there. We have already had two meetings where we agreed on the basic parameters. The group should be established at the beginning of next year. And it is currently cooperating very closely with the European Commission and other organizations that deal with this issue.
