    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The proposal to increase parental allowance <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=490\">passed</a> its second reading in the Chamber of Deputies on 25 September 2019. It is intended <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=161461\">to increase</a> (.pdf, p. 2, point 4) parental allowance by 80 thousand, from 220 thousand to 300 thousand crowns. In addition, the European Parliament Directive on work-life balance for parents and carers <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158\">was passed</a> on 20 June 2019. This directive is to be implemented by 2 August 2022 in all Member States (Article 20) and, for example, extends the length of paternity leave to 10 days, which is an extension of <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/otcovska-dovolena-se-prodlouzi-na-deset-dnu/r~03b973acb82f11e9b16b0cc47ab5f122/\">three</a> days.</p><p> As for the change in maternity leave, MEP Maxová probably means the changes described in Article 5 of this <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158\">directive</a> . According to it, each parent is entitled to 4 months of parental leave. Two of these months are non-transferable and, according to Article 8, also paid. According to the directive, parental leave can also be conditioned by the total time worked or the duration of the employment relationship. However, this period may not exceed 1 year.</p><p> In response to this directive and the increase in parental allowance, Radka Maxová has already expressed herself in the past and even then demanded a systemic <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/radka-maxova-rodice-volaji-hlavne-po-moznostech-skloubeni-pracovniho-a-rodinneho-7801534\">change</a> (video 10:40): &quot; <em>We wanted Minister Maláčová to say that if we were going to add this amount, then there needed to be a systemic change in the support for families from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. And that maybe we could talk about, could talk about, postponing the increase. So that it would be combined with work and private life, with the financing of children&#39;s groups, actually with the relationship to the directive that will be approved by the European Parliament</em> .&quot;</p><p> However, there has been no systemic change, i.e. a comprehensive amendment that would comprehensively regulate the individual institutions supporting working parents, including, for example, in connection with the aforementioned European directive. Individual areas are therefore amended separately, within separate amendments.</p><p> In addition to the amount of parental allowance, adjustments are also expected for children&#39;s groups. Children&#39;s groups <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/deti-jesle-platit-skupiny-prispevky.A190522_093831_domaci_elz\">are</a> places where children can be placed before starting kindergarten. There are currently 959 of these places in the Czech Republic with a capacity of over 14 thousand children. However, these children&#39;s groups are paid for from European funds, which will end after 2020 (groups that have applied for this will be funded until 2022).</p><p> The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs wants children&#39;s groups to be paid for from the state budget from <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2931710-jesle-se-vraci-malacova-chce-prejmenovat-detske-skupiny-a-hradit-je-z-rozpoctu\">2021</a> .</p><p> With the support of workers, one can also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske\">imagine</a> the emergence of part-time work. In the European Union, the Czech Republic <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-66249480-zapad-eu-valcuje-vychodni-zeme-bloku-v-podilu-lidi-pracujicich-na-zkraceny-uvazek-cesko-je-ve-srovnani-mezi-poslednimi\">is</a> among the countries with a lower popularity of part-time work. The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/jana-malacova-mpsv-castecny-uvazek-novela-zakonik-prace_1907161848_per\">expressed</a> a positive opinion on part-time work and stated that she is preparing an amendment to the Labor Code, which would include, among other things, the establishment of a shared job, which should support part-time work so that people can more easily have, for example, a twenty-hour workday.</p><p> VAT on home childcare services is also to <a href=\"https://www.finance.cz/527687-nizsi-dph-u-piva-holicky/\">be reduced</a> , which is another item that Radka Maxová <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske\">mentioned</a> in the context of increasing the parental allowance. However, the VAT reduction <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2019/novela-zakona-o-evidenci-trzeb-miri-do-t-34995\">does not</a> include tax on children&#39;s needs.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because all the above-mentioned changes were not linked together. This procedure can therefore be described as non-systematic, given that the individual amendments are being prepared gradually and independently of each other. The situation will also be affected by the European Parliament directive, which is to be implemented by August 2022, children&#39;s groups will then be funded by the state possibly from 2021, but the so-called micro-nurseries ( <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2741900-na-mikrojeslich-si-rodice-oblibili-hlavne-osobnejsi-pristup-k-detem-vznikaji-i-v\">nurseries with</a> a maximum of four children) have still not been resolved. The VAT reduction for home childcare services is then prepared, but the tax reduction for children&#39;s needs has not yet been adopted at all.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>On September 17, 2019, an interview with Radka Maxová was published on the website <a href=\"https://denikn.cz/198131/na-socialni-sluzby-penize-nejsou-ale-nasla-se-miliarda-na-kurovce-rika-maxova-v-ano-zustava-kvuli-pracovitym-lidem/\">denikn.cz</a> , where she was asked, among other things, about her opinion on the suspension of the prosecution of Andrej Babiš. We were unable to find any other media outlets discussing this topic with MEP Maxová.</p><p> The <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/OJ-9-2019-09-16-SYN_CS.html\">Strasbourg</a> meeting took place from 16 to 19 September, and on none of the days was there any topic related to Andrej Babiš on the agenda. As for the <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/EMPL-PV-2019-09-24-1_EN.pdf\">Brussels</a> meeting, on 24 September there was a meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which Radka Maxová probably has in mind. The minutes also do not mention the discussion of the topic of Prime Minister Babiš and the suspension of his criminal prosecution.</p>\nSECTION C: <p><a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-intergroup-european-parliament\">The Disability Intergroup</a> is an informal group of Members of the European Parliament interested in supporting people with disabilities and their rights. This “intergroup” is one of the oldest, first established in 1980.</p><p> After the last elections to the European Parliament, an initiative was taken <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/newsroom/news/european-disability-movement-calls-reestablishment-disability-intergroup-european\">to revive</a> this group in the new composition of the Parliament. The exact sequence of events and negotiations between the EU Disability Forum (EDF, an umbrella organization that helps people with disabilities) and the MEPs is not available, but Radka Maxová, who attended the negotiations and supports the establishment of the group, can also be considered the initiator of the establishment of the Disability Intergroup in the European Parliament.</p><p> If Maxová is talking in her statement about the MPs she managed to recruit for this group, or about the date of the group&#39;s establishment, then we were unable to verify these parts of the statement from public sources. Information about the negotiations on the group is only provided by posts on the social networks of MEP Maxová and EDF. Only the following two posts mention the creation of the aforementioned Disability Intergroup: </p><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fradka.maxova.1%2Fposts%2F2417964951767893&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"584\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FEuropeanDisabilityForumEDF%2Fposts%2F2545439382145973&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"830\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div><p> The contributions prove the meetings of MEPs (including Maxová) with EDF, the content of which is the planned creation of the Disability Intergroup.</p><p> Information on the current number of signatures and representation of all committees is not publicly available anywhere. The group&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-intergroup-european-parliament\">website</a> only provides <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/sites/default/files/disability_intergroup-mep_support_form_0.pdf\">a form</a> (.pdf) for MEPs to express their support for the group&#39;s establishment for the years 2019–2024. The same website also provides <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/sites/default/files/disability_intergroup_meps_list_-_update_october_2018.xls\">a list</a> (.xls) of the group&#39;s supporters, but this is for the previous period (2014–2019), not the one currently being negotiated.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
