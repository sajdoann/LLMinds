After taking the oath, Miloš Zeman <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CT24.cz/videos/386820792025695/\">said</a> , among other things:</p><p> &quot; <em>What is the broad path that leads every minister of culture into oblivion? The fact that he goes to various receptions, openings, premieres, festivals, and so on, and so on. Sometimes he awards a grant or subsidy, and of course the media sphere applauds him. Cultural monuments, Mr. Minister, do not applaud. Cultural monuments are silent and decay. Yet these monuments are the minutiae of the Czech landscape. And we have been unable to supplement these minutiae, which were created by our ancestors, with almost nothing else. It is our shame, but let us at least try to save what others have built.</em> &quot;</p><p> The National Heritage Institute <a href=\"https://www.npu.cz/pamatkovy-fond\">states</a> that there are over 700 dilapidated cultural monuments in the Czech Republic out of a total of 40,000. These include, for example, <a href=\"https://www.npu.cz/cs/npu-a-pamatkova-pece/pamatky-a-pamatkova-pece/pamatkovy-fond/seznam-ohrozenych-nemovitych-pamatek/32147-oranzerie-hrad-veveri-brno\">the orangery</a> at Veveří Castle in Brno, <a href=\"https://www.npu.cz/cs/npu-a-pamatkova-pece/pamatky-a-pamatkova-pece/pamatkovy-fond/seznam-ohrozenych-nemovitych-pamatek/42181-zimni-zahrada-zamek-velke-opatovice\">the winter garden</a> at the Velké Opatovice Chateau or <a href=\"https://www.npu.cz/cs/npu-a-pamatkova-pece/pamatky-a-pamatkova-pece/pamatkovy-fond/seznam-ohrozenych-nemovitych-pamatek/46568-socha-sv-floriana-areal-frantiskanskeho-klastera-brno\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.npu.cz/cs/npu-a-pamatkova-pece/pamatky-a-pamatkova-pece/pamatkovy-fond/seznam-ohrozenych-nemovitych-pamatek/38714-zamek-v-hornim-marsove\">castle</a> in Horní Maršov.</p><p> Lubomír Zaorálek was appointed to the position after a three-and-a-half-month-long dispute over the head of the Ministry of Culture department. Former Minister of Culture Antonín Staněk (ČSSD) <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2815571-cesko-potrebuje-noveho-ministra-kultury-kritizovany-stanek-ohlasil-rezignaci\"></a><a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2815571-cesko-potrebuje-noveho-ministra-kultury-kritizovany-stanek-ohlasil-rezignaci\"></a> <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2815571-cesko-potrebuje-noveho-ministra-kultury-kritizovany-stanek-ohlasil-rezignaci\">submitted</a> his resignation in mid-May, at the request of the head of the ČSSD, Jan Hamáček. President Zeman <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/antonin-stanek-milos-zeman-demise_1905281745_dok\">did not accept</a> Staňek&#39;s resignation. The head of the ČSSD, Jan Hamáček <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2827265-prezident-neprijal-demisi-ministra-kultury-stanka\">, said</a> that he would therefore ask Prime Minister Babiš to propose to the president the dismissal of Antonín Staňek from office. In such a case, President Zeman would have to dismiss Antonín Staňek according to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl74\">Article 74 of Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll. of the Constitution</a> of the Czech Republic. At the same time, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2827265-prezident-neprijal-demisi-ministra-kultury-stanka\">he proposed</a> the deputy chairman of the ČSSD, Michal Šmarda, as the new Minister of Culture. Andrej Babiš proposed the dismissal of the Minister of Culture to the president, but he <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2883683-zive-stanek-se-louci-s-ministerstvem-kultury-podekovat-mu-prisel-premier-babis\">remained</a> in office until the end of July. Then, until the appointment of Lubomír Zaorálek on August 27, Deputy René Schreier temporarily <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2883683-zive-stanek-se-louci-s-ministerstvem-kultury-podekovat-mu-prisel-premier-babis\">took over</a> the ministry. President Zeman <a href=\"https://www.hrad.cz/cs/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/aktualni-tiskove-zpravy/prohlaseni-prezidenta-republiky-1-14950#from-list\">refused</a> to appoint the potential candidate Michal Šmarda in August, according to him, he was not professionally competent. Michal Šmarda finally <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2901029-smarda-pro-ct-ve-vlade-andreje-babise-byt-nechci\">withdrew</a> his nomination for the post of Minister of Culture a few days after the president announced his nomination.</p><p> The ČSSD therefore <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2902175-novym-ministrem-kultury-ma-byt-zaoralek-potvrdil-hamacek-zeman-souhlasi\">proposed</a> Lubomír Zaorálek, who <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2902175-novym-ministrem-kultury-ma-byt-zaoralek-potvrdil-hamacek-zeman-souhlasi\">has been</a> a member of the ČSSD since 1994. Since then, he has held a number of positions, and <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2902826-zaoralek-se-v-politice-pohybuje-od-80-let-se-zemanem-mel-spory\">is</a> now the chairman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, a member of the committee for science, education, culture, youth and sports, and a foreign policy expert for the ČSSD. The new minister of culture&#39;s <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2907302-zive-prezident-jmenuje-lubomira-zaoralka-ministrem-kultury\">priorities</a> include, among other things, increasing salaries in culture and overall stabilization of the department.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Compulsory voting was introduced by Act No. <a href=\"http://ftp.aspi.cz/opispdf/1920/027-1920.pdf\">123/1920</a> Coll. (.pdf, pp. 275, 283). The following persons were exempt from compulsory voting:</p><ul><li> were over 70 years old, or</li><li> were unable to appear at the polling station due to illness or physical disability, or</li><li> were unable to attend the elections due to urgent obligations of their office or profession, or</li><li> were at least 100 km away from the polling place on election day, or</li><li> were delayed by traffic disruptions or other insurmountable obstacles</li></ul><p> Unexcused attendance was punishable by a fine of 20 to 5,000 CZK or imprisonment of 1 day to 1 month.</p><p> After World War II, compulsory voting was again established in Act No.<a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1946-67\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1946-67\">67/1946</a> Coll. The amendment of the law was almost identical to the law from the First Republic, only the possibility of casting a so-called white ballot (not voting for any party) was added. The same conditions for compulsory voting are also stated in <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1948-75#p16\">the Election Act</a> of 1948. This Act was repealed by Act No. <a href=\"http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1954-27\">27/1954</a> Coll., which removed the obligation to vote. Thus, compulsory voting did not formally exist from mid-1954, yet according to <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/20536128/422008p7_3.pdf/e12cd508-ad65-44f6-ae0e-99d2491a49ae?version=1.0\">data</a> from the Czech Statistical Office, voter turnout did not fall below 99% until the 1990 elections.</p><p> The Communists did not introduce compulsory voting in the true sense of the word, they merely took over an earlier law that had been in effect since 1920 (or 1946). They eventually repealed the electoral law in this form.<br/></p>\nSECTION C: <p>President Miloš Zeman <a href=\"https://www.barrandov.tv/video/167732-tyden-s-prezidentem-24-10-2019\">stated</a> the following on TV Barrandov on October 24, 2019 (time 6:27): <em>&quot;Let Mr. Koudelka focus on economic crime in the Czech Republic instead of fictitiously chasing Russian and Chinese spies.&quot;</em></p><p> The President also responded to <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2955386-tajne-sluzby-rozbily-sit-kterou-v-cesku-vytvareli-rusove\">the speech</a> of the Director of the Security Information Service, Michal Koudelka, in the Chamber of Deputies on October 21, 2019. He stated that the BIS and the National Center for Organized Crime (NCOZ) had last year uncovered and dismantled a spy network that was being built in the Czech Republic by the Russian intelligence service. The Russian Embassy denied this claim.</p><p> The BIS <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/vyrocni-zpravy/vyrocni-zprava-bezpecnostni-informacni-sluzby-za-rok-2017-d85907e6.html\">annual report</a> from 2017 also talks about Russian and Chinese influence. The report talks about two cyberattacks on <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/public/site/bis.cz/content/vyrocni-zpravy/2017-vz-cz.pdf\">the Foreign Ministry</a> (.pdf, pp. 15-16), about the &quot;infiltration&quot; of the Russian diplomatic mission by people with contacts in intelligence services (pp. 6-8), but also about disinformation websites (pp. 7-8).</p><p> A BIS spokesperson <a href=\"https://denikn.cz/minuta/221224/\">defended himself</a> against Miloš Zeman&#39;s statement of October 24, 2019, saying: <em>&quot;The fight against corruption is not within the legal competence of the BIS. This issue is addressed by special units of the Czech Police.&quot;</em></p><p> The status and scope of the BIS are determined by Act <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153\">No. 153/1994 Coll.</a> on the Intelligence Services of the Czech Republic. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153#p5-1-d\">Section 5,</a> the BIS provides information on activities whose consequences may threaten the security or significant economic interests of the Czech Republic. According to the official website of the BIS, a significant economic interest <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/ekonomicke-zajmy-statu/\">is understood to be</a> an interest in the functionality of systems with a broad economic reach and in the optimal management of assets, the loss of which could threaten the basic functions of the state. <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1993ps/tisky/t101600.htm\">The explanatory memorandum</a> to the Act on Intelligence Services speaks of the need to &quot; <em>detect through intelligence efforts also efforts directed against the mechanisms of the financial and economic functioning of the state in cases where their consequences may damage the interests of the Czech Republic&quot;.</em> These economic interests may be influenced, among other things, by illegal activities, which can include corruption, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the law or on the BIS website.</p><p> It cannot be ruled out that a specific case of corruption that would significantly threaten the economic interests of the Czech Republic could fall within the scope of the BIS. However, in general, the fight against economic crime is not within the scope of the BIS. This is investigated by specialized units of the Czech Police, <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/uokfk-skpv-utvar-odhalovani-korupce-a-financni-kriminality-skpv.aspx\"></a> for example, the Corruption and Financial Crime Detection <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/uokfk-skpv-utvar-odhalovani-korupce-a-financni-kriminality-skpv.aspx\">Unit</a> or the Organized Crime Detection <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/utvar-pro-odhalovani-organizovaneho-zlocinu-skpv-199737.aspx\">Unit</a> of the SKPV.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
