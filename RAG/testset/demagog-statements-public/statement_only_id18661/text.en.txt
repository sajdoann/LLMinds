When I recently told him (the director of the BIS Koudelka, note: Demagog.cz) that he should deal more with economic crime, the BIS spokesperson said that economic crime is not in the BIS job description, which means we have a stupid spokesperson here who doesn&#39;t even know the BIS Act, which includes the obligation to protect the economic interests of the Czech Republic. And tell me, what else but economic crime, including corruption and the fight against it, is the defense of economic interests.
