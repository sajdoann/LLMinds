Danuška, Dana Košanová, my little daughter, go to sleep already. I think that was a poem by Vojtěch Mihálik, who later deserted to the regime, but wrote this beautiful poem at the time. Do you know who Dana Košanová was? She has a monument now and she was shot by a Soviet soldier, no tank, Mr. Soukup, normal shooting. I don&#39;t even know if it was from behind.
