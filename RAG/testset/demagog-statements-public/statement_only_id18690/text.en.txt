I was happy, for example, that I could support another year of the Romea scholarship awards for Roma students of secondary and higher vocational schools with Olga Richterov√°. It is a great project, but unfortunately there is a double excess of applicants who should receive the scholarship. It is not high, but the 14 thousand is a lot for their families.
