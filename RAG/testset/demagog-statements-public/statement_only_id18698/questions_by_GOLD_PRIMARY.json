    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Ivan Bartoš and Olga Richterová jointly <a href=\"http://www.romea.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/domaci/primy-prenos-slavnostni-predavani-certifikatu-v-ramci-stipendijniho-programu-romea\">participated in</a> the certificate presentation ceremony as part of <a href=\"https://www.romskastipendia.cz/index.php/pro-studenty/pro-stredoskolaky-a-studenty-vos\">the Roma Scholarship Program for Roma students in secondary schools and vocational schools</a> , organized by Romeo. At the event, which took place on October 11 in the Brožík Hall of the Old Town Hall, they jointly gave a short speech in which they supported the project and spoke about the vision of accessible education for all. </p><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fivan.bartos.37%2Fposts%2F10217529831778255&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"746\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div><p> The program is in its fourth year and 69 applicants <a href=\"http://www.romea.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/domaci/primy-prenos-slavnostni-predavani-certifikatu-v-ramci-stipendijniho-programu-romea\">received</a> scholarships this year. The organization does not provide exact numbers of scholarship applicants, but <a href=\"https://romskastipendia.cz/index.php/aktuality/257-kdo-ziska-ze-studentu-ss-a-vos-stipendium-na-dalsi-skolni-rok-vysledky-budou-na-konci-letnich-prazdnin\">it says</a> that last year there were approximately 150 applications. However, in the same article, scholarship program manager Jitka Votavová states that limited funds allow for scholarships to be provided to only about a third of applicants, which would mean 180 applications, given the 60 scholarships awarded last year.</p><p> The caption on the recording of this year&#39;s ceremony, which was provided by the internet television ROMEA TV, states that the scholarship recipients were selected from <em>&quot;more than 130 applicants&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiqf2eL4H0c\">video</a> , caption under the video, which is shown from 6:15 to 6:34). In his opening remarks, the moderator Lukáš Kotlár said that <em>&quot;the interest in Roma scholarships is really great, up to 150 students apply for these scholarships within the framework of the Romea program every year&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiqf2eL4H0c\">video</a> , 2:56). The exact number for this year is therefore probably between 130 and 150 applicants. This corresponds to approximately twice the number of scholarships awarded.</p><p> The amount of scholarships for secondary school students <a href=\"https://romskastipendia.cz/index.php/pro-studenty/pro-stredoskolaky-a-studenty-vos\">is</a> 14,000 CZK per school year, while the organization offers a higher scholarship grant to VOŠ students, namely 21,000 CZK per school year.</p><p> We therefore assess the statement as true. We do not assess the amount of the scholarship as a value judgment, just as we do not assess its relative amount for the awarded families.</p>\nSECTION B: <p><a href=\"http://www.korupce.cz/cz/o-nas/o-nas-104793/\">The Department for Combating Corruption</a> is an organizational unit of the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic. The activities of this department must be in accordance with the Statute and Rules of Procedure of the Government Council for the Coordination of the Fight against Corruption. The Council was established by <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/PJUA9NDCLZA9\">a government resolution</a> of 30 July 2017.</p><p> Ivan Bartoš mentions <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=10700\">the Working Group for the Assessment of Legislation on Anti-Corruption Measures</a> . It was founded by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Radek Vondráček (ANO). The aim of this <a href=\"https://www.rekonstrukcestatu.cz/cs/archiv-novinek/12067-poslanci-vytvorili-novou-pracovni-skupinu-proti-korupci\">group</a> is to find consensus in the approval of anti-corruption laws by means of discussion forums for members of political parties, non-profit organizations, and the public. Those interested in discussing drafts of current laws should meet approximately once a month, and the first meeting, held on February 1, 2018, was attended by representatives of several political parties.</p><p> There is no mention in the public media space of the existence of the aforementioned version, which would allow for, for example, an information embargo.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>The government <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134598\">proposal</a> (.pdf) for an amendment to Act No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1999-106\">106/1999 Coll.</a> , on free access to information, adds the following sentence to Section 2: <em>&quot;The Act shall not apply to the provision of information on ongoing criminal proceedings and persons participating in them, with the exception of information on court decisions on the merits.&quot;</em> (.pdf, p. 28).<em> </em>The amendment to the Act would thus make it impossible to access information on ongoing criminal proceedings under Act No. 106/1999 Coll., including procedural decisions in the proceedings. Therefore, if a question were asked, it would be completely outside the competence of the Act and there would be no need to handle it.</p><p> In the current version of the Act on Free Access to Information <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1999-106#p11-4-a\">, Section 11</a> already contains a ban on providing information on ongoing criminal proceedings (i.e. everything up to the decision in the case). The law therefore required that the request be processed in such a way that the information is not provided. However, this rule is broken by the case law ( <a href=\"http://sbirka.nssoud.cz/cz/svobodny-pristup-k-informacim-informace-o-probihajicim-trestnim-rizeni.p2162.html\">judgment</a> no. 1 As 44/2010 – 103, point 36) of the Supreme Administrative Court, which requires obliged entities to consider each individual case and, depending on the circumstances, to allow the provision of information on ongoing criminal proceedings where the failure to provide information cannot be justified by an “urgent social need”. Courts may therefore provide information on ongoing criminal proceedings despite the statutory ban, if the failure to provide information is not necessary.</p><p> According to <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134598\">the explanatory report</a> (.pdf, p. 127) of the government amendment, this situation led to &quot; <em>a far-reaching burden on criminal justice authorities, who always had to justify in detail why information could not be provided (if they did not provide it), with difficulties arising from the question of how to argue without using the information itself&quot;.</em><br/><br/> If the government amendment were to enter into force, the obligation of authorities involved in criminal proceedings to provide reasons for (not) providing information during the proceedings, as established by case law, would cease. Only the obligation to provide information on the decision on the merits would be maintained. The public would thus not have access to information on ongoing criminal proceedings and procedural decisions, which are often crucial for the development of the proceedings. According to <a href=\"http://sbirka.nssoud.cz/cz/svobodny-pristup-k-informacim-informace-o-probihajicim-trestnim-rizeni.p2162.html\">the NSS</a> (point 38), providing information on ongoing criminal proceedings is often in the public interest, especially in cases involving criminal acts committed by officials or public officials. Such a case is, among others, the procedural <a href=\"http://www.ceska-justice.cz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Rath_VS_171016.pdf\">resolution</a> of the High Court in Prague in the David Rath case, by which the High Court rejected wiretapping as illegal.<br/><br/> The discussion of the amendment to the law in the third reading was included on <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/ischuze.sqw?o=8&amp;s=20\">the agenda</a> of the 20th meeting and should take place on November 14, 2018.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Bartoš is probably referring to Babiš&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2017-cr/andrej-babis-i/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-13-12-2017-27-06-2018-166989/\">first</a> minority government from December 2017 to July 2018, which did not gain <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/premier-andrej-babis-neduvera-poslanecka-snemovna-mensinova-vlada-demise-hnuti_1801161555_haf\">the confidence</a> of the Chamber of Deputies. Its draft amendment to the Civil Service Act was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=132\">submitted</a> to the Chamber on March 26, 2018, i.e. 2 months after submitting his resignation.</p><p> Given the terminology (&quot;the first thing the government started to address&quot;), it is more of a figure of speech than a factual statement that it should be the first law submitted. However, it is worth adding that this was not the first government bill since taking <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/prezident-milos-zeman-jmenoval-vladu-premiera-andreje-babise-162087/\">office</a> . Between December 13, 2017 and March 26, 2018, the government submitted an amendment <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=46\">to the Act</a> on the CNB, an amendment to <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=56\">the Act</a> on the Transfer of Ownership, an amendment <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=90\">to the Act</a> on the Organization and Implementation of Social Security, or <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=120\">an amendment</a> to the Act on Pension Insurance. Even the Ministry of the Interior, as the representative of the proposer, did not submit an amendment to the Act on Civil Service as the first part of its agenda; it was preceded, for example, by an amendment <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=59\">to the Act</a> on Elections to the Parliament of the Czech Republic.<br/><br/> In April 2018, the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj\">criticized</a> the government&#39;s draft amendment to the Civil Service Act. As we read in a letter from European Commissioner for Employment Marianne Thyssen<em> </em>to the Deputy Minister of the Interior for the Civil Service, Josef Postránecký: &quot; <em>We therefore remain concerned about key elements of the proposal. For example, the shift to somewhat low requirements for the second rounds of selection procedures for management positions, the possibility of dismissing managers based on a &#39;sufficient&#39; evaluation result, the possibility of dismissing civil servants based on two service evaluations within a 40-day period, and the deprivation of managers from the possibility of filing an objection against a service evaluation.</em> &quot; At the same time, the European Commissioner notes that the amendment was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in March 2018 and asks to provide analytical materials that led to its form.<br/><br/></p>\nSECTION E: <p>Over the past few months, the opposition has clashed with supporters <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?t=509&amp;o=8\">of the government&#39;s tax package</a> in the Chamber of Deputies. For example, Miroslav Kalousek from TOP 09 described the new taxation of <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/opozice-opet-kritizovala-danovy-balicek-ministryne-ho-hajila/1801587\">insurance company reserves</a> as the most dangerous and harmful part of the package and proposed <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=162339\">to cancel</a> this change (.doc, p. 2). Miroslav Kalousek further claims that the tightening of conditions will motivate foreign owners of insurance companies in the Czech Republic to send dividends abroad.</p><p> Another criticized point of the law is the increase in the fee for <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2952944-zive-snemovna-mela-schvalovat-vladni-danovy-balicek\">registering a property in the cadastre</a> from the current 1,000 crowns to double it. MPs Věra Kovářová (STAN), Mikuláš Ferjenčík (Pirates) and Jan Bartošek (KDU-ČSL) <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/opozice-opet-kritizovala-danovy-balicek-ministryne-ho-hajila/1801587\">submitted</a> a joint <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=162386\">proposal</a> (.doc) in which they want to delete this part from the proposal.</p><p> The last of the opposition proposals mentioned in the statement is the attempt to abolish <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/opozice-opet-kritizovala-danovy-balicek-ministryne-ho-hajila/1801587\">the real estate acquisition tax</a> , which is being pursued <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=162092\">by the ODS</a> (.doc). <a href=\"https://www.lidovky.cz/domov/dan-z-nabyti-nemovitosti-se-bude-platit-dal-snemovna-odmitla-navrh-senatu-na-zruseni.A190924_203904_ln_domov_ele\">The Senate</a> attempted the same change, but it was also rejected. However, none of these proposals <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=168103\">were</a> (.doc, pp. 4–5, 9) adopted.</p><p> On the contrary, the Pirates&#39; amendments to improve conditions for <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=162409\">home brewing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=161936\">poker</a> players were <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=168103\">accepted</a> in the Chamber of Deputies (.doc, pp. 7, 9).</p><p></p>\nSECTION F: <p>On November 3, Mikuláš Ferjenčík started a new discussion thread on the Pirate Forum called <em>&quot;</em> <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407\"><em>Establishment of a Party Ombudsman / Mediation Team</em></a> <em>&quot;.</em> The purpose of this thread is to determine whether to establish an institution within the Pirate Party that would aim to resolve internal party conflicts and create peace and consensus. At the same time, it should be an advisory institution where members could go if they felt that someone else in the party was treating them inappropriately. This thread also discusses the question of how <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407#p650292\">to fill</a> this position and whether it should be <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407&amp;start=20#p650352\">an internal</a> or external institution. This thread also discussed the question of whether it must be experts or whether listening to empathetic party members would be sufficient.</p><p> <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407&amp;start=30#p650657\">Ivan Bartoš</a> divided his contribution to the forum into three parts. The first part concerns what the Pirates can resolve themselves, in the second part he focused on their own processes and their compliance, and in the third part he dealt with the mediation team, the ombudsman. In the third part of his contribution, he expressed himself in such a way that he would imagine an external institution and that it should be experts. He further stated: <em>&quot;For my part, I would like the Pirates to have resolved everything that is possible, including, for example, the selection of a partner to resolve these issues, by Christmas this year.&quot;</em></p><p> <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407\">A poll question</a> was attached to this thread <em>: &quot;Do you consider the establishment of an ombudsman or mediation team a good idea?&quot;</em> The possible answers to this poll are Yes, No, and I don&#39;t know. 85 out of 100 voters voted in favor of establishing this institution, 6 voters were against, and 9 voters chose the I don&#39;t know option.</p><p> According to the Pirate Party&#39;s <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=248&amp;t=48927&amp;p=650901#p650901\">budget</a> proposal for 2020, 300,000 crowns should be reserved for the creation of an ombudsman institution, a mediation team, or the hiring of a supervisor.<br/></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
