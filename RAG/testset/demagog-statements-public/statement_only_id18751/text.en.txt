ALSO, moderator: And the European Union, the European Commission appreciated it? You said. Does that mean some philosophical reservation like: no nuclear, that&#39;s out of the question, that wasn&#39;t made? HAVLÍČEK: In no case was it made at all. On the contrary, what was said was that it is right that we are heading towards a zero-emission economy, or rather energy, ad 1 and ad 2, it was clearly said that nuclear is a zero-emission source. The fact that someone has a tendency from time to time, especially from among the critics, to question that, that was said literally and literally by the Director General, (...) that&#39;s what the Director General of the Directorate General Energo, the European Commission, said directly.
