    "Please answer TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWABLE about the text's veracity. In addition write a short summary explaining your answer. If the veracity cannot be determined answer UNKNOWABLE. The first sentence in the response should be TRUE. FALSE. or UNKNOWABLE. eg:UNKNOWABLE.",
    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The national energy mix <a href=\"https://www.ote-cr.cz/cs/statistika/narodni-energeticky-mix\">represents</a> the share of energy sources in a country. It is an overview of the use of energy from individual <a href=\"https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/about-energy-mix\">primary sources</a> such as fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, oil), nuclear sources and renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and others).</p><p> The resulting energy mix <a href=\"https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/about-energy-mix\">varies</a> from region to region and country. It depends on the given natural, economic and social conditions. Historical, geopolitical, environmental and other factors also play a role.</p><p> The Czech Republic&#39;s energy policy is based on <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/dokumenty/52841/60959/636207/priloha006.pdf\">the State Energy Concept of the Czech Republic</a> (.pdf). This represents a long-term national strategy that is set &quot; <em>in accordance with the long-term energy strategy of the European Union focused on decarbonization, high security of supply and competitive energy prices</em> &quot; ( <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/dokumenty/52841/60959/636207/priloha006.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 5).</p><p> European Union legislation in the field <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/cs/sheet/68/energy-policy-general-principles\">of energy</a> focuses mainly on issues of the common market and the environment.</p><p> Energy is covered by Title XXI of Part Three <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT\">of the Treaty</a> on the Functioning of the European Union. Article 194(1) of the Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">sets out</a> (.pdf, p. 134) the objectives of EU policy and its scope in the field of energy: &quot; <em>To ensure the functioning of the energy market; to ensure the security of energy supply in the Union; to promote energy efficiency and energy saving as well as the development of new and renewable energy sources; and to promote the interconnection of energy networks.</em> &quot;</p><p> Paragraph 2 of Article 194 <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">declares</a> (.pdf, p. 135) the independence of Member States in the formulation of their own energy policies. The article states that legislation and measures to achieve the objectives of paragraph 1 shall not affect &quot; <em>the right of a Member State to determine the conditions for the exploitation of its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the fundamental composition of its energy supply.</em> &quot;</p><p> There are therefore standards and regulations that influence the energy policy of individual EU member states, but the composition of the energy mix is the responsibility of the states.</p><p> One of the measures concerning the EU internal market and also affecting the energy sector is illegal aid. This is defined in Article 107 of <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT\">the Treaty</a> on the Functioning of the European Union: &quot; <em>Any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market, save as otherwise provided in the Treaties</em> &quot; ( <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">.pdf</a> , p. 91).</p><p> The Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 92) that the Commission monitors the compatibility of state aid with the internal market and may, where appropriate, order the state to abolish or adjust unlawful aid (Article 108(2)).</p><p> Furthermore, the Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 92) that “ <em>the Commission must be informed in sufficient time of any plans to grant or alter aid in order to enable it to submit its observations. If it considers that such a plan is not compatible with the internal market having regard to Article 107, it shall immediately initiate the procedure referred to in paragraph 2. The Member State concerned shall not put the envisaged measures into effect until the Commission has taken a final decision on the procedure</em> ” (Article 108(3)).</p><p> Another example of legislative criteria are environmental commitments. In 2015, the European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_15_4485\">presented</a> the so-called Energy Union, which aims to ensure a secure, sustainable, affordable and competitive energy system in the EU. There are a number of EU strategies and targets in the field of climate and energy (e.g. Energy Strategy <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2030-energy-strategy\">2030</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2050-energy-strategy\">2050</a> ).</p><p> One of the EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2030-energy-strategy\">requirements</a> is to introduce a 32% share of renewable energy sources by 2030. This and other requirements are implemented by the National Energy and Climate <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/2019/11/Vnitrostani-plan-CR-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu.docx\">Plan</a> of the Czech Republic (.docx). This climate and energy <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/2019/11/Vnitrostani-plan-CR-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu.docx\">plan</a> (.docx, pp. 26–27) states that “ <em>The Czech Republic plans to achieve a share of renewable energy sources in gross final consumption of 22% by 2030, which is an increase of 9 percentage points compared to the national target of 13% for 2020. The stated share of 22% corresponds to the requirement to express a national contribution to achieving the binding EU target of 32% by 2030 according to Article 3 of the revised version</em> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0028\"><em>of Directive 2009/28/EC</em></a> <em>on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (</em> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018L2001\"><em>Directive 2018/2001</em></a> <em>).</em> “</p><p> The National Climate and Energy <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/2019/11/Vnitrostani-plan-CR-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu.docx\">Plan</a> (.docx, p. 1) corresponds to the priorities of the European Commission, which presented them on November 30, 2016 as part of the &quot;Clean Energy for All Europeans&quot; <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/IP_16_4009\">package</a> .</p><p> The EU&#39;s nuclear policy is based on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012A/TXT\">the Treaty</a> establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. EU countries <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/nuclear-energy/overview\">decide</a> for themselves whether to include nuclear energy in their energy mixes.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlíček is talking about negotiations with the European Union regarding <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/vystavba-noveho-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan-by-mela-zacit-v-roce-2029--250598/\">the completion of</a> a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany nuclear power plant. The Ministry of Industry and Trade has previously stated that the supplier should be selected by the end of 2022. The entire construction should therefore begin in 2029 at the latest, so that the new nuclear unit can be completed by 2036.</p><p> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said at the time that the construction was related to current events in Europe, both the fight against climate change and the reduction of emissions.</p><p> <em>&quot;If we look at what Europe looks like today, France is in first place, with 52 nuclear reactors, a nuclear share of 75 percent and a leader in the initiative to reduce CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Sweden has ten nuclear units and they also have hydropower resources. Unfortunately, we only have 30 percent at the moment and our goal is to have a nuclear share of 40 percent in 2040,&quot;</em> said Prime Minister Babiš <em>.</em> At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/babis-cr-musi-stavet-jaderne-bloky-i-kdyby-porusila-pravo-eu/1809832\">he has emphasized</a> in the past that the completion of the units must begin, even if it leads to a violation of European law.</p><p> Minister Havlíček further <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2976530-novy-jaderny-blok-v-dukovanech-ma-byt-dokoncen-v-roce-2036-uvedl-babis\">stated</a> that the Czech Republic is negotiating the construction with the European Union with regard to the safety of the new facility and that it is also initiating the notification process with the European Commission, i.e. a certain authorization from the European Commission. As stated in the interview, these negotiations <a href=\"https://ekolist.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/zpravy/cesi-jednali-poprve-v-bruselu-o-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan\">began</a> on November 20, 2019. In addition to the Czech energy mix, the Czech delegation also presented a vision for renewable sources in the Czech Republic, which should lead to a so-called <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2985236-cesko-miri-k-bezemisni-energetice-bude-predevsim-o-jadru-a-obnovitelnych-zdrojich\">zero-emission economy</a> .</p><p> We asked about the course of these negotiations to <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/ministerstvo/o-ministerstvu/vedouci-pracovnici/namestek-rene-nedela---strucny-portret--239909/\">the Deputy</a> for the Energy Section at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ing. et Ing. René Neděla, who also <a href=\"https://ekonomickydenik.cz/cesi-jednali-bruselu-poprve-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan/\">attended</a> the negotiations. Since Deputy Neděla confirmed to us that the statements mentioned by Minister Havlíček actually occurred on the part of the Commission, we assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>According to information from <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/vystavba-noveho-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan-by-mela-zacit-v-roce-2029--250598/\">the Ministry of</a> Industry and Trade (MIT), a zoning decision on the construction of a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant should be issued in 2021, a supplier should be selected by the end of 2022, construction should begin in 2029, and the investment should be completed in 2036. There is a risk that in 2040, electricity supplies would not cover consumption for 678 or even up to 3,622 hours a year, and electricity consumption would therefore have to be regulated.</p><p> According to the news website <a href=\"https://ekolist.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/zpravy/cesi-jednali-poprve-v-bruselu-o-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan\">Ekolist.cz,</a> a Czech delegation discussed the construction of a new nuclear unit in Dukovany in Brussels on November 20, 2019. It was the first major meeting that precedes the European Union&#39;s approval of the completion of the planned new unit at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant. We asked René Neděla, <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/ministerstvo/o-ministerstvu/vedouci-pracovnici/namestek-rene-nedela---strucny-portret--239909/\">Deputy Minister</a> of Industry and Trade for Energy, who also <a href=\"https://ekonomickydenik.cz/cesi-jednali-bruselu-poprve-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan/\">participated</a> in the meeting, whether the Commission had truly appreciated the Czech Republic&#39;s move towards a zero-emission economy.
