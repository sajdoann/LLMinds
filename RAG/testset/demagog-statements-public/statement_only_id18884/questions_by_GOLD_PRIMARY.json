    "Please answer TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWABLE about the text's veracity. In addition write a short summary explaining your answer. If the veracity cannot be determined answer UNKNOWABLE. The first sentence in the response should be TRUE. FALSE. or UNKNOWABLE. eg:UNKNOWABLE.",
    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The Ministry of the Interior also commented on the draft Building Act in its <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNBK2CPYTM\">analysis</a> (.pdf). In her statement, Minister Dostálová criticizes the estimates of the Ministry of the Interior, which estimated one-time costs at CZK 2.2—31.6 billion (p. 4). The part of securing space for new regional building offices and the <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/pripominky-k-stavebnimu-zakonu-muze-mmr-resit-do-konce-brezna/1838883\">planned</a> Supreme Building Office is mainly criticized.</p><p> The Ministry of the Interior states in the introduction to the section <em>on Premises</em> (p. 32) that the draft law “(...) <em>currently assumes an optimistic scenario where municipalities and regions will provide the state with their current premises. This expectation is unrealistic; the capacity of municipalities and regions will not be made available, as it would bring extraordinary problems in the area of IT, operation, sharing of services (e.g. the registry office) or working in a different regime (the Act on Civil Servants vs. the Civil Service Act). In the event of delimitation, it will be necessary to provide premises.</em> ”<em> </em>Estimates for securing premises by renting are around CZK 425 million per year. The Ministry further notes that “ <em>(...) it is not possible to solve the delimitation by renting everywhere, as no suitable premises are available at all in certain locations.</em> ”<em> </em>(p. 33)</p><p> The chapter dedicated to Construction (pp. 33—34) then states that &quot; <em>The maximalist variant assumes that new premises would be built for all existing officials of building authorities, integrated affected bodies and new service personnel. This includes 13,584 employees in total. Construction expenses would reach at least 25.4 billion crowns in the maximalist variant.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(p. 34). To these costs it would be necessary to add the costs of building archives for storing documentation. These costs are around CZK 3.5 billion. In total, the Ministry of the Interior estimates the construction in the most expensive possible version at CZK 28.9 billion.<br/><br/> Minister Dostálová falsely stated that &quot; <em>(...) the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior does not state that the state currently pays municipalities for the officials who handle construction procedures&quot;</em> . The chapter Financing the Agenda in the analysis deals with this entire issue.<em> </em>(p. 36), which details the current financing of the agenda of building authorities, spatial planning and partly also the affected authorities, which are currently financed through a contribution to the performance of state administration (pursuant to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-128#p62-1\">Section 62 of Act No. 128/2000 Coll., on municipalities</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-129#p29-2\">Section 29(2) of Act No. 129/2000 Coll., on regions</a> ).</p><p> The procedures for determining the amount of the contribution for the performance of state administration for 2020 are listed in <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-355#f6688621\">the annex to</a> Act No. 355/2019 on the State Budget of the Czech Republic for 2020. The individual contribution amounts for specific municipalities can also be clearly found on <a href=\"https://www.prispevekobce.cz/\">the website</a> of the Ministry of the Interior.</p><p> The Ministry of the Interior further <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNBK2CPYTM\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 38) that the total real costs (including overheads) for the agenda of building authorities and land planning authorities at the municipal and regional levels amount to almost 4.6 billion CZK, of which 4.2 billion CZK are spent on municipalities. However, in reality, only 2.3 billion CZK is spent on the state budget through contributions to municipalities and regions. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the real overhead costs amount to 1.1 billion CZK.</p><p> Although the probability of constructing new buildings for all planned employees of new building authorities is unknown, we assess the statement as false, because the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior also addresses the issue of financing building authorities through contributions for the performance of state administration, the amount of which differs from those mentioned in Minister Dostálová&#39;s statement.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
