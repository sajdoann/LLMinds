Even in the 2017 pre-election strategy, and in the next one, it is clearly defined. We said that we will not go with undemocratic parties or support a government that will use their votes. So at the moment it is SPD or KSÄŒM. And then we set clear conditions and those conditions of cooperation were there. It will not be a government that will have a majority of YES. There will be no people who have a corrupt past or are in a conflict of interest.
