    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Ivan Bartoš talks here about the so-called &quot;prison&quot; <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/pirati-maji-v-kampani-vezensky-autobus.A170814_114707_domaci_kop\">bus</a> , which the Pirates used as part of their election campaign in the 2017 elections to the Chamber of Deputies. It also appeared in their election <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/predstaveno-predvolebni-video-pustte-nas-na-ne.html\">spot</a> . </p><p></p><img src=\"https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaElLIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--9ae94c3d6d7e2ad07447b3963b906e3940dd58bd/KOP6d4d85_autobus1.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p> Source: <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/pirati-maji-v-kampani-vezensky-autobus.A170814_114707_domaci_kop\">iDnes.cz</a><br/><br/> On the side of the bus are caricatures of some top politicians, drawing attention to well-known cases. Among those depicted are indeed people from the ČSSD. Specifically, these are Bohuslav Sobotka, who is connected to the OKD <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2945291-zive-snemovni-komise-k-privatizaci-okd-zverejni-co-zjistila\">case</a> , and David Rath, who was finally <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2852663-soud-vynese-pravomocny-verdikt-v-korupcni-kauze-davida-ratha\">convicted</a> of corruption in 2019 after <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/policiste-zadrzeli-stredoceskeho-hejtmana-davida-ratha-a-dalsich-sedm-lidi_201205151305_akottova\">seven</a> years of detention.</p><p> The last sentence of the statement speaks of <a href=\"https://www.top09.cz/osobnosti/ing-miroslav-kalousek-512.html\">Miroslav Kalousek</a> , who served as Minister of Finance in the second <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2007-cr/mirek-topolanek-2/prehled-ministru-24440/\">government of</a> Mirek Topolánek for <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2013-cr/petr-necas/ing--miroslav-kalousek-74211/\">the KDU-ČSL</a> and then again in <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2010-cr/petr-necas/prehled-byvalych-clenu-vlady-petra-necase-96390/\">the government of</a> Petr Nečas, this time for TOP 09.</p><p> Other politicians depicted on the side of the bus are Andrej Babiš and Jana Nečasová (Nagyová).</p><p></p>\nSECTION B: <p>Lukáš Wagenknecht <a href=\"http://www.nfpk.cz/oznamovatele/4198\">is</a> truly an expert in the fight against corruption. For his work, for example, in 2015 he received the Courage Award from the Anti-Corruption Foundation.</p><p> Wagenknecht was the first deputy at the Ministry of Finance from February<a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/volby/lukas-wagenknecht-andrej-babis-obse-agrofert_1904171355_haf\">2014</a> , when Andrej Babiš was the Minister of Finance. He dismissed him after a year and a quarter, although he also offered him the position of political deputy, which Wagenknecht did not accept.</p><p> In his statement, Ivan Bartoš is apparently referring to <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/babis-odvolal-prvni-namestka-wagenknechta.A150620_070857_domaci_zt\">the conflict</a> between Lukáš Wagenknecht and Andrej Babiš regarding the non-transparent tender procedure for the IT system prepared by the Ministry of Regional Development. This case ultimately <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1608335-brusel-dal-cesku-stopku-na-dotace-na-projekty-za-568-milionu-korun\">led</a> to the suspension of the disbursement of subsidies in the amount of 568 million crowns. However, we will not assess the real reasons for Wagenknecht&#39;s dismissal, because we understandably do not know the real motivation of Prime Minister Babiš.<br/><br/> In 2018, Lukáš Wagenknecht was actually <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/senat/se1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=9&amp;xt=1\">elected</a> senator for the Pirates.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>On November 3, Mikuláš Ferjenčík started a new discussion thread on the Pirate Forum called <em>&quot;</em> <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407\"><em>Establishment of a Party Ombudsman / Mediation Team</em></a> <em>&quot;.</em> The purpose of this thread is to determine whether to establish an institution within the Pirate Party that would aim to resolve internal party conflicts and create peace and consensus. At the same time, it should be an advisory institution where members could go if they felt that someone else in the party was treating them inappropriately. This thread also discusses the question of how <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407#p650292\">to fill</a> this position and whether it should be <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407&amp;start=20#p650352\">an internal</a> or external institution. This thread also discussed the question of whether it must be experts or whether listening to empathetic party members would be sufficient.</p><p> <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407&amp;start=30#p650657\">Ivan Bartoš</a> divided his contribution to the forum into three parts. The first part concerns what the Pirates can resolve themselves, in the second part he focused on their own processes and their compliance, and in the third part he dealt with the mediation team, the ombudsman. In the third part of his contribution, he expressed himself in such a way that he would imagine an external institution and that it should be experts. He further stated: <em>&quot;For my part, I would like the Pirates to have resolved everything that is possible, including, for example, the selection of a partner to resolve these issues, by Christmas this year.&quot;</em></p><p> <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=632&amp;t=49407\">A poll question</a> was attached to this thread <em>: &quot;Do you consider the establishment of an ombudsman or mediation team a good idea?&quot;</em> The possible answers to this poll are Yes, No, and I don&#39;t know. 85 out of 100 voters voted in favor of establishing this institution, 6 voters were against, and 9 voters chose the I don&#39;t know option.</p><p> According to the Pirate Party&#39;s <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=248&amp;t=48927&amp;p=650901#p650901\">budget</a> proposal for 2020, 300,000 crowns should be reserved for the creation of an ombudsman institution, a mediation team, or the hiring of a supervisor.<br/></p>\nSECTION D: <p>By the term &quot;pre-election&quot;, Pirates Chairman Bartoš probably means <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/program/psp2017/povolebni-strategie/\">the 2017 post-election strategy</a> , which the Pirates published before the 2017 elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the introduction of which states:</p><p> <em>&quot;We will negotiate with all other political parties. Our support for any government is conditional on the fact that incompetent people or people with a history of corruption are not nominated to the government. In no case will we support a government with the participation of entities threatening the foundations of liberal democracy or with a historical legacy of the liquidation of democracy in this country, i.e. in particular with the participation of the KSČM, SPD or a predominance of ANO.&quot;</em> The post-election strategy further states: <em>&quot;We will demand reasonable guarantees to prevent abuse of power, for example, we will refuse to support candidates who would be in a constant conflict of interest.&quot;</em></p><p> The Pirates therefore really condition their support for the government on the democracy of their potential coalition partners. According to the cited post-election strategy, the Pirates reject cooperation with the SPD and the KSČM. Ivan Bartoš further states the refusal to support a government in which the ANO movement will have a majority, which is also in line with the cited part of the strategy. According to the cited post-election strategy, Bartoš also states a corrupt past and a conflict of interest as an obstacle to possible support for the government.</p><p> There is also a pirate <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/program/eu2019/strategie\">post-election strategy for the 2019</a> European Parliament elections, which is in line with the previously cited document. It states:</p><p> &quot; <em>We want our program priorities and personnel requirements for the Commissioners to be reflected in the negotiations. European Commissioners must be competent people, without corruption scandals and ties to lobbyists of large corporations. (...) We therefore refuse to participate in the formation of a political group with undemocratic parties or parties that do not respect human rights or are fundamentally against the existence of the European Union as such.&quot;</em></p>\nSECTION E: <p>Jindřich Šídlo actually <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/batolata-s-plamenometem-se-chystaji-prevzit-moc-pomohli-jsme-piratum-vybrat-cleny-jejich-budouci-vlady-79756\">used</a> the phrase &quot;toddlers with flamethrowers&quot; in his show Happy Monday on September 30, 2019. Specifically, at 5 minutes and 32 seconds. The entire sentence reads: &quot; <em>These are the Pirates, or as we, traditional voters, toddlers with flamethrowers, who may soon rule us.&quot;</em> He used this sentence after describing the internal party vote on performers at a pre-election rally before the 2019 EP elections. The vote was on whether the leader of the candidate, Marcel Kolaja, or a pony, would speak at the rally. The pony <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/pirati-ponici-hlasovani-kolaja-olomouc-anketa-evropsky-parlament.A190523_093758_zahranicni_elz\">won</a> .</p><p> The phrase was not <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/spratci-s-plamenometem-chteji-zmeknout-a-vzit-babisovi-volice-neztrati-ty-vlastni-86178?seq-no=86&amp;dop-ab-variant=&amp;source=clanky-home\">repeated</a> literally by the reporter of the Seznam Zprávy server, Václav Dolejší, specifically saying &quot;with <em>workers with flamethrowers&quot;.</em> In his article, he describes his view of the national pirate forum, which took place between January 11 and 12, 2020. He also describes, from his perspective, the coming of age of the party, the Pirate Party&#39;s plans for the next elections, and also the vote to dissolve the party, which is allegedly <a href=\"https://www.televizeseznam.cz/video/stastne-pondeli/o-rozpusteni-strany-budeme-hlasovat-kazdy-rok-varuji-pirati-64020001\">an exaggeration</a> (time 1:31) and takes place every year.</p><p> The words &quot;toddlers&quot; and &quot;toddlers&quot; are different, but they share a common context.</p><p> However, the phrase &quot;toddlers with flamethrowers&quot; has been used several times in history. Specifically, in the program <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/10117034229-168-hodin/219452801101027\">168 hodin</a> (time 8:00) broadcast on October 27, 2019, Václav Dolejší stated that he had read the term on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=batolata%20s%20plamenometem&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\">Twitter</a> . Before the broadcast, the term was mentioned on Twitter three times. On September 30, 2019, which could have been related to Jindřich Šídl&#39;s program. However, the absolute first traced mention of this term dates back to September 29, 2017, when Petr Honzejk mentioned it in <a href=\"https://nazory.ihned.cz/c1-65896710-volebni-denik-petra-honzejka-pirati-jedou-copak-nam-vezou-z-napadu-na-vladu-vseholidu-jdou-na-liberala-mrakoty\">Hospodářské noviny</a> , saying that he found it on Josef Bouška&#39;s Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bouska.j?fref=search&amp;__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARATv4gnMklW-3fhW7T_6Ng1rzvfL_T7Di8q8pbhcxbV2_78eUX0x_OdUuVJu0E_WLYxWR1PRrg8_GWG\">profile</a> . We went through the posts, but we did not find the mention. However, the post may have been deleted.</p><p> Although the term &quot;toddlers with flamethrowers&quot; appeared before Jindřich Šídlo used it, he undoubtedly contributed significantly to its popularization, and we therefore assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>Pirate Party National <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/volby/start\">Election Team</a><a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/volby/start\"></a> consists of an election committee and an election coordinator. The functioning of the election committee is regulated by <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/rules/vr#volebni_kampan\">Section 15c</a> of the Election Code. The election committee currently has 6 people and its chairman is Senator <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/lide/lukas-wagenknecht/\">Lukáš Wagenknecht</a> . He was unanimously elected to the position by the members of the election committee at an introductory <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=858&amp;t=35968&amp;start=10#p637788\">meeting</a> held on July 19, 2019.</p><p> Other members include <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/lide/karolina-sadilkova/\">Karolína Sadílková</a> (representative of the media department), <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/lide/helena_vondrakova\">Helena Vondráková</a> (coordinator of the Liberec region and representative of the personnel department), <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/lide/petr-fojtik/\">Petr Fojtík</a> , <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/lide/kamil_kubica\">Kamil Kubica</a> and <a href=\"https://cz.linkedin.com/in/ales-krupa-89b23933\">Aleš Krupa</a> .
