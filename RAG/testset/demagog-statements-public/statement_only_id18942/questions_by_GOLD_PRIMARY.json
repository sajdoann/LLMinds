    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Marian Jurečka, together with a group of deputies elected for the KDU-ČSL, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=439\">submitted</a> <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?O=8&amp;CT=439&amp;CT1=0\">a proposal</a> (.pdf) for an amendment to the Pension Insurance Act on March 29, 2019. The explanatory report contains a total of 12 proposals, of which 10 proposals concern widow&#39;s pensions, students and mothers&#39; compensation.</p><p> The proposals regarding widows&#39; pensions are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to ease the requirements for the deceased spouse&#39;s insurance period by 5 years for entitlement to an old-age pension as a condition for obtaining entitlement to a widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pension.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the minimum period of receiving widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions from 1 year to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to bring the threshold before retirement age for permanent receipt of widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions closer - from 4 to 8 years before reaching retirement age.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the period after the end of entitlements, after which a widow&#39;s pension can be granted again if the conditions for entitlement arise again, from 2 years to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to increase the percentage assessment for widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions, from the current 50% to 80% of the percentage assessment of the pension to which the spouse was or would have been entitled at the time of death.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed that if the conditions for entitlement to payment of disability and widow&#39;s or widower&#39;s pension are simultaneously met, the percentage assessment of both pensions is paid in full and half of the percentage assessment is paid from the other pensions, unless the amount pursuant to paragraph 1 is higher.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> For students, it is <em>&quot;proposed that university studies be counted as a substitute insurance period even after December 31, 1995.&quot;</em></p><p> The proposals for compensating mothers are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;In order to quickly partially correct the unfairly low pensions of mothers (or fathers in a substitute role) who contributed to the pension system by caring for and raising children, [it is] proposed to increase the percentage assessment of the old-age pension by CZK 500 per month for each child raised.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to reduce the mandatory insurance period to 10 years for obtaining a pension entitlement after reaching retirement age</em> . <em>&quot;</em> According to the explanatory memorandum, this may apply, for example, to mothers of multiple children who lack a replacement insurance period.</li><li> <em>&quot;Furthermore, it is proposed to allow mothers (and in similar cases fathers who took care of the children instead of the mother) to retire earlier before reaching retirement age, by one year for each child raised, and at the same time without any current sanctions.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> According to the former chairman of the KDU-ČSL, Marek Výborný, the cost of adding 500 crowns for each child raised would <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66548830-vyssi-duchody-pro-zeny-ktere-vychovaly-deti-politici-jsou-pro-ale-nachazeji-nejruznejsi-ale\">reach</a> 16 billion crowns per year. The same amount is also stated <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?O=8&amp;CT=439&amp;CT1=0\">in the explanatory report</a> (.pdf, p. 8). Given that Marian Jurečka incorrectly calculated the budgetary impact of increasing the pension assessment by 500 CZK, we assess the statement as false.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
