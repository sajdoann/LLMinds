    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>In his statement, Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlíček gives an illustrative example of the increasing costs of completing the Mochovce nuclear power plant in Slovakia.</p><p> Construction of the Slovak Mochovce nuclear power plant began in 1981. The two originally planned units with a total output of 880 MW were <a href=\"https://www.skoda-js.cz/reference/jaderna-elektrarna-mochovce-2/\">completed</a> and commissioned in 1998 and 2000, respectively, while the construction of units 3 and 4, which Minister Havlíček is talking about, was <a href=\"http://www.seas.sk/data/file/87/sz-eia-mo34-sk.pdf\">suspended</a> in 1992 (.pdf, pp. 1–3) and <a href=\"http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf\">preserved</a> for a long time (.pdf, p. 11).<br/><br/> The actual construction work <a href=\"http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf\">began</a> (.pdf, p. 12) in 2008 with a planned completion date of 2013 or 2014, but there have been several delays and the construction has become more expensive, for example due to <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/slovensky-urad-zjistil-nedostatky-v-budovane-jaderne-elektrarne-1362287\">the introduction of</a> new safety features. According to the current plan, the power plant should be <a href=\"https://cz.seas.sk/jaderna-elektrarna-mochovce\">completed</a> in 2020. However, developments <a href=\"https://oenergetice.cz/rychle-zpravy/dokonceni-slovenske-jaderne-elektrarny-mochovce-se-prodrazi-a-opet-opozdi/\">indicate</a> that completion or start of operation on schedule may not happen again.</p><p> The construction of units 3 and 4 was stopped at a relatively advanced stage. At the time of the construction of the building, approximately 70% of the construction work had already <a href=\"http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf\">been completed</a> (.pdf, p. 11) and approximately 30% of the equipment had been delivered. If Minister Havlíček is talking about this basis for the construction of the nuclear power plant worth 1 to 2 billion euros, then we have not been able to verify this amount. However, given the scope of the work carried out, it is likely that the amounts involved are in the order of billions of euros, as Havlíček correctly states.</p><p> If we now take a closer look at the financing of the completion of the Mochovce power plant, the latest reported cost increase <a href=\"https://oenergetice.cz/rychle-zpravy/dokonceni-slovenske-jaderne-elektrarny-mochovce-se-prodrazi-a-opet-opozdi/\">is</a> 5.67 billion euros, which is 144.6 billion crowns at <a href=\"https://www.kurzy.cz/kurzy-men/nejlepsi-kurzy/EUR-euro/\">the exchange rate</a> of 25 November 2019. For example, in 2014, the estimated costs <a href=\"https://www.seas.sk/clanok/akcionari-schvalili-rozpocet-na-dokoncenie-mochoviec/138\">were</a> 4.6 billion euros, which would be 117.3 billion crowns at today&#39;s exchange rate. If the price of the power plant was set at 7 billion euros, the price of the power plant would be 178.5 billion crowns at today&#39;s exchange rate. Similar prices are not <a href=\"https://oenergetice.cz/jaderne-elektrarny/jake-jsou-ceny-za-jaderne-reaktory-iii-generace/\">unusual</a> .</p><p> Let us add that <a href=\"https://www.seas.sk/mochovce-3-4-npp\">the output</a> of the parts of the nuclear power plant being built should be 2 x 471 MWe, a total close to the 1000 MW stated by Havlíček.</p><p></p>\nSECTION B: <p>The national energy mix <a href=\"https://www.ote-cr.cz/cs/statistika/narodni-energeticky-mix\">represents</a> the share of energy sources in a country. It is an overview of the use of energy from individual <a href=\"https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/about-energy-mix\">primary sources</a> such as fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, oil), nuclear sources and renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and others).</p><p> The resulting energy mix <a href=\"https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/about-energy-mix\">varies</a> from region to region and country. It depends on the given natural, economic and social conditions. Historical, geopolitical, environmental and other factors also play a role.</p><p> The Czech Republic&#39;s energy policy is based on <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/dokumenty/52841/60959/636207/priloha006.pdf\">the State Energy Concept of the Czech Republic</a> (.pdf). This represents a long-term national strategy that is set &quot; <em>in accordance with the long-term energy strategy of the European Union focused on decarbonization, high security of supply and competitive energy prices</em> &quot; ( <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/dokumenty/52841/60959/636207/priloha006.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 5).</p><p> European Union legislation in the field <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/cs/sheet/68/energy-policy-general-principles\">of energy</a> focuses mainly on issues of the common market and the environment.</p><p> Energy is covered by Title XXI of Part Three <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT\">of the Treaty</a> on the Functioning of the European Union. Article 194(1) of the Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">sets out</a> (.pdf, p. 134) the objectives of EU policy and its scope in the field of energy: &quot; <em>To ensure the functioning of the energy market; to ensure the security of energy supply in the Union; to promote energy efficiency and energy saving as well as the development of new and renewable energy sources; and to promote the interconnection of energy networks.</em> &quot;</p><p> Paragraph 2 of Article 194 <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">declares</a> (.pdf, p. 135) the independence of Member States in the formulation of their own energy policies. The article states that legislation and measures to achieve the objectives of paragraph 1 shall not affect &quot; <em>the right of a Member State to determine the conditions for the exploitation of its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the fundamental composition of its energy supply.</em> &quot;</p><p> There are therefore standards and regulations that influence the energy policy of individual EU member states, but the composition of the energy mix is the responsibility of the states.</p><p> One of the measures concerning the EU internal market and also affecting the energy sector is illegal aid. This is defined in Article 107 of <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT\">the Treaty</a> on the Functioning of the European Union: &quot; <em>Any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market, save as otherwise provided in the Treaties</em> &quot; ( <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">.pdf</a> , p. 91).</p><p> The Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 92) that the Commission monitors the compatibility of state aid with the internal market and may, where appropriate, order the state to abolish or adjust unlawful aid (Article 108(2)).</p><p> Furthermore, the Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 92) that “ <em>the Commission must be informed in sufficient time of any plans to grant or alter aid in order to enable it to submit its observations. If it considers that such a plan is not compatible with the internal market having regard to Article 107, it shall immediately initiate the procedure referred to in paragraph 2. The Member State concerned shall not put the envisaged measures into effect until the Commission has taken a final decision on the procedure</em> ” (Article 108(3)).</p><p> Another example of legislative criteria are environmental commitments. In 2015, the European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_15_4485\">presented</a> the so-called Energy Union, which aims to ensure a secure, sustainable, affordable and competitive energy system in the EU. There are a number of EU strategies and targets in the field of climate and energy (e.g. Energy Strategy <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2030-energy-strategy\">2030</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2050-energy-strategy\">2050</a> ).</p><p> One of the EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2030-energy-strategy\">requirements</a> is to introduce a 32% share of renewable energy sources by 2030. This and other requirements are implemented by the National Energy and Climate <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/2019/11/Vnitrostani-plan-CR-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu.docx\">Plan</a> of the Czech Republic (.docx). This climate and energy <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/2019/11/Vnitrostani-plan-CR-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu.docx\">plan</a> (.docx, pp. 26–27) states that “ <em>The Czech Republic plans to achieve a share of renewable energy sources in gross final consumption of 22% by 2030, which is an increase of 9 percentage points compared to the national target of 13% for 2020. The stated share of 22% corresponds to the requirement to express a national contribution to achieving the binding EU target of 32% by 2030 according to Article 3 of the revised version</em> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0028\"><em>of Directive 2009/28/EC</em></a> <em>on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (</em> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018L2001\"><em>Directive 2018/2001</em></a> <em>).</em> “</p><p> The National Climate and Energy <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/2019/11/Vnitrostani-plan-CR-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu.docx\">Plan</a> (.docx, p. 1) corresponds to the priorities of the European Commission, which presented them on November 30, 2016 as part of the &quot;Clean Energy for All Europeans&quot; <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/IP_16_4009\">package</a> .</p><p> The EU&#39;s nuclear policy is based on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012A/TXT\">the Treaty</a> establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. EU countries <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/nuclear-energy/overview\">decide</a> for themselves whether to include nuclear energy in their energy mixes.</p>\nSECTION C: <p><a href=\"https://www.nukib.cz/cs/o-nukib/\">NÚKIB</a> is the central administrative authority for cybersecurity, including the protection of classified information in the field of information and communication systems and cryptographic protection. The abbreviation NÚKIB stands for National Office for Cyber and Information Security.</p><p> On December 17, 2018, the agency issued <a href=\"https://www.nukib.cz/cs/uredni-deska/\">a warning</a> against the use of software and hardware from Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. The agency&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.nukib.cz/download/uredni-deska/Varov%C3%A1n%C3%AD%20N%C3%9AKIB%202018-122-17.pdf\">report</a> (.pdf, p. 1) states, among other things, that &quot; <em>the use of technical or program resources from the above-mentioned companies poses a threat to cybersecurity</em> .&quot; The agency justifies its position, among other things, by saying that Chinese laws and the political environment &quot; <em>require private companies to cooperate in pursuing the interests of the PRC, including participation in intelligence activities&quot;</em> (p. 1).<br/><br/> State agencies and private companies that manage critical information infrastructure or important information systems <a href=\"https://www.itbiz.cz/zpravicky/huawei-vyvoj-kauzy\">are required</a> by law to conduct a security audit based on a warning from the National Cybersecurity Office. The institutions <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/huawei-kauza-vyrobky-cinska-firma-varovani-nukib-analyza-audit-riziko_1901250600_kno\">are not required</a> to publish their analysis or submit it to the government. By law, only the Cybersecurity Office can review the audits.</p><p> Analyses of critical systems falling under the Cybersecurity Act were already <a href=\"https://www.nukib.cz/cs/informacni-servis/aktuality/1349-ministerstva-urady-i-firmy-provedly-predepsane-analyzy-prijimaji-opatreni-ke-snizeni-rizika/\">completed</a> in the first half of this year. Other systems have also undergone analysis; for example, the Ministry of the Interior planned <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/varovani-nukib-huawei-bezpecnostni-hrozba-ministerstva_1903260600_tec\">to complete</a> the analyses of all systems only by the end of the third quarter of 2019. However, this was due to the large number of systems that the ministry manages. On the contrary, the Ministries of Health and Labor and Social Affairs, for example, completed audits of all their systems in the spring of 2019.</p><p> We therefore assess the statement as false, because even though we cannot rule out that some audit is actually underway, most of them, especially audits of critical infrastructure, have already been completed.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>The Minister of Industry and Trade, Karel Havlíček, has indeed announced to the media his intentions to postpone the frequency auction in which the fourth operator is to be selected. The first mentions appeared in <a href=\"https://www.respekt.cz/spolecnost/ministr-premysli-ze-odlozi-aukci-na-ctvrteho-operatora\">October</a> 2019. At that time, the start of the auction was <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/ctu-presunul-zahajeni-aukce-mobilnich-kmitoctu-na-leden/1810374\">postponed</a> to the beginning of January 2020. According to the media, the reason was Vodafone&#39;s complaint to the European Commission about network sharing by CETIN and T-Mobile, or rather the Commission&#39;s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/ip_19_5110\">communication</a> , which implies a possible restriction of competition.</p><p> Talk of a further shift began again in <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/internet-a-pc/mobil/clanek/ctvrty-operator-v-cesku-ministerstvo-zvazuje-posunuti-aukce-5g-siti-40306971\">December</a> 2019. Minister Havlíček argued that the current auction conditions would not attract a sufficient number of bidders.</p><p> A fundamental change was brought about by the resignation, or rather the dismissal, of the head of the Czech Telecommunications Office, Jaromír Novák. He submitted his resignation on January 31, 2020. The government <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABLBBAHHQ\">managed</a> to dismiss him that day. Jaromír Novák <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xmireknovak/status/1221716597624184833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1221716597624184833&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lupa.cz%2Fclanky%2Fpredseda-rady-ctu-jaromir-novak-rezignoval-kvuli-tlaku-ministra-na-aukci-5g-kmitoctu%2F\">justified</a> his resignation by saying that he was dissatisfied with the development of the auction conditions.</p><p> As for the argument about security risks, we were unable to find any statements or reports in connection with the Ministry of Industry and Trade mentioning a potential security risk. The only mentions of the security issue were made after Jaromír Novák was dismissed. In an article for <a href=\"https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/proc-verim-ve-ctvrteho-operatora/\">the Lupa.cz</a> server, Novák stated that he had asked the Prime Minister to check the economic ties between potential participants in the auction and the resulting security risks. He said that he had not encountered any problems that would lead to the exclusion of any participant from the auction. In an interview for <a href=\"https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66713970-zlevneni-prinese-jen-silny-ctvrty-operator-inspirace-slovenskem-nicemu-nepomuze-rika-odvolany-sef-ctu-novak\">Hospodářské noviny</a> , he also stated that he had not received any information from the security services last autumn.</p><p> We cannot therefore decide whether the Ministry of Industry and Trade or Minister Havlíček personally warned anyone about the security risks of potentially setting the auction in favor of one participant. However, no one from the Ministry of Industry and Trade spoke publicly about such a risk.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>According to information from <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/vystavba-noveho-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan-by-mela-zacit-v-roce-2029--250598/\">the Ministry of</a> Industry and Trade (MIT), a zoning decision on the construction of a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant should be issued in 2021, a supplier should be selected by the end of 2022, construction should begin in 2029, and the investment should be completed in 2036. There is a risk that in 2040, electricity supplies would not cover consumption for 678 or even up to 3,622 hours a year, and electricity consumption would therefore have to be regulated.</p><p> According to the news website <a href=\"https://ekolist.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/zpravy/cesi-jednali-poprve-v-bruselu-o-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan\">Ekolist.cz,</a> a Czech delegation discussed the construction of a new nuclear unit in Dukovany in Brussels on November 20, 2019. It was the first major meeting that precedes the European Union&#39;s approval of the completion of the planned new unit at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant. We asked René Neděla, <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/ministerstvo/o-ministerstvu/vedouci-pracovnici/namestek-rene-nedela---strucny-portret--239909/\">Deputy Minister</a> of Industry and Trade for Energy, who also <a href=\"https://ekonomickydenik.cz/cesi-jednali-bruselu-poprve-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan/\">participated</a> in the meeting, whether the Commission had truly appreciated the Czech Republic&#39;s move towards a zero-emission economy.
