    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The petition &quot;Uncultured Minister&quot; addressed to Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and Chairman of the ČSSD Jan Hamáček was created in Prague on <a href=\"https://www.nekulturniministr.cz/\">April 24,</a> 2019. The signatories call on the Prime Minister to propose to the President of the Republic the dismissal of Antonín Staněk from the position of Minister of Culture. They then ask Chairman Hamáček that the ČSSD, as a coalition partner of ANO, support the dismissal of Antonín Staněk from the position of Minister of Culture. According to the authors of the petition, Minister Staněk should be dismissed <a href=\"https://www.nekulturniministr.cz/\">due to</a> <strong>&quot;</strong> <em>incompetence, loss of trust and failure (...) in the position of the highest government representative in the field of culture.&quot;</em> The initiators and signatories of the petition subsequently <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/pr/index_view.php?id=1751827\">granted</a> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš&#39;s request for a meeting. They presented their demands to him <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/petice-proti-ministru-kultury-stankovi-babis-hamacek.A190502_213523_domaci_cern\">on May 2</a> at the Government Office. The Chairman of the ČSSD Jan Hamáček also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrejBabis/status/1124178809488592896\">attended</a> the meeting.</p><p> Vice-Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary Roman Onderka <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/219411030500428/\">said</a> in the Czech Television&#39;s Questions with Václav Moravec on April 28th <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/219411030500428/\"></a> (time 7:37) that he would consider Staněk&#39;s end in the cabinet. In the event that Minister Staněk does not justify his actions, according to Onderka, it is appropriate for the Social Democrats to consider a replacement within this ministry. Therefore, it is not true that he would directly demand Staněk&#39;s resignation.<em> </em>Two days earlier, Minister Staňek was supported by the chairman of the ČSSD, Hamáček: &quot; <em>I am not planning a change in the post of Minister of Culture,&quot;</em> <a href=\"https://denikn.cz/minuta/117249/\">he wrote to</a> Deník N at the time.</p><p> From <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/onderka-prezident-uz-mel-stanka-odvolat-ustava-neni-trhaci-k/r~20d3961e9e6411e9b7740cc47ab5f122/\">the interview</a> of the vice-chairman of the ČSSD, Roman Onderka, for Aktuálně.cz on July 4, 2019, it is clear that he does not like his name being associated with the demand for the resignation of Minister Staněk. When asked by the editor whether Minister of Culture Staněk should leave the government, Onderka replied: &quot; <em>Mr. Moravec asked me if steps were being taken to dismiss Mr. Staněk. I said yes, but it was not as the headlines said, that Onderka wanted to dismiss Staněk.&quot;</em></p>\nSECTION B: <p>We interpret the term “our period” as the period when the ANO movement ruled in a minority cabinet after the elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the autumn of 2017. Taking into account a certain amount of time to form a government, we examined the changes in the Value Added Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Act”) from 1 January 2018. Since this period, VAT has been reduced under three amendments. These were Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll., Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">6/2019</a> Coll.</p><p> Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> Coll. were government bills that introduced a reduction in VAT on a wide range of goods and services. What did not escape great media attention was the reduction in the rate on beer.</p><p> List of goods and services for which the VAT rate was reduced by Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll.:</p><ol><li> <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501?text=%C2%A7%2047\">Electronic books</a></li><li> Catering services, serving drinks (VAT on beer is reduced under this item)</li><li> Interior cleaning services performed in households</li><li> Home care for children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled</li><li> Shoe and leather goods repair</li><li> Repairs and alterations of clothing and textile products</li><li> Bicycle repairs</li><li> Hairdressing and barber services</li></ol><p> As part of Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=68877\">80/2019</a> Coll. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=104.\">, &quot;heat and cold</a> &quot; was moved from the first reduced rate (15%) to the second reduced rate (10%).</p><p> Since these were government amendments to the law, it is understandable that they were <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=70948\">supported</a> by the ANO movement. Deputies from the ČSSD and the KSČM, which supports the government, also <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=69368&amp;l=cz\">voted</a> for the proposals. In fact, not a single deputy was against the amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> .</p><p> The amendment to the VAT Act No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">6/2019</a> Coll. was adopted in the Chamber of Deputies as <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=140\">a parliamentary proposal</a> by deputies from the STAN movement. It also contains a reduced rate for regular land public passenger transport, which Andrej Babiš talks about in his statement. In the Chamber of Deputies, this amendment <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=68622&amp;l=cz\">was not supported</a> by the ANO movement and deputies from the ČSSD, the vast majority of whom abstained from voting.</p><p> Regular ground public passenger transport has therefore <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">moved</a> from the first reduced rate (15%) to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-235?text=p%C5%99%C3%ADloha%20%C4%8D.%202a\">the second</a> reduced rate (10%). However, carriers have made it clear that the reduction in the rate will not bring a reduction in prices. For example, Leo Express spokesman Emil Sedlařík <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/\">told</a> Aktuálně.cz: <em>&quot;The reduction in the VAT rate comes at the same time as an increase in the prices of traction electricity, wages and other cost items. Thanks to the reduction in the VAT rate, we can better cover these increased expenses, which will not affect the price of our tickets.&quot;</em> Radek Joklík, spokesman for Czech Railways, made a similar <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/\">statement</a> .<br/><br/> For the reasons stated above, we evaluate the statement as true.<br/><br/></p>\nSECTION C: <p>Given the fact that the current President of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, has neither publicly confirmed nor denied his friendly relationship with Andrej Babiš, we have no choice but to assess this statement as unverifiable. Andrej Babiš remains the only one who has publicly described this relationship as friendly. It should be noted that the two have known each other since their joint meetings as finance ministers.</p><p> The relationship between Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and the current President of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, can be traced back to the times when the two met in <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/node/5930801\">negotiations</a> as finance ministers. The common point of their possible good relationship is precisely the area of state finances and Schäuble&#39;s understanding of the different positions of individual EU countries, despite his support for further EU integration, <a href=\"http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/schauble-musime-lidem-dokazat-ze-evropa-muze-znamenat-rozdil-ptj-/tema.aspx?c=A160806_230532_pozice-tema_lube\">the importance of</a> intergovernmental negotiations of EU member <a href=\"https://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/schaeuble-germany-and-france-could-participate-at-visegrad-four-meeting\">states</a> , and, if necessary, practical steps <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1835594-nemecky-ministr-financi-pohrozil-evropske-komisi-ztratou-vlivu-nezacne-li-jednat\">regardless</a> of the European Commission. On the other hand, Schäuble also expressed understanding for <a href=\"https://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/zahranici/evropa/schauble-nemecko-vitanim-bezencu-zachranilo-cest-evropy_358120.html\">the reluctance</a> of some countries towards the redistribution of refugees.</p><p> Andrej Babiš himself has described his relationship with Wolfgang Schäuble as friendly or close several times - for example, in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/premier/v-mediich/rozhovor-predsedy-vlady-andreje-babise-pro-hospodarske-noviny-165627/\">HN</a> on May 18, 2018, he stated the following:</p><p> <em>&quot;We have the same views, for example, with the new German Interior Minister Seehofer, whom I know and I like very much. It is similar with Wolfgang Schäuble, the former Finance Minister, whom I can call my friend,&quot;</em> he added, <em>&quot;Schäuble was previously the Interior Minister and understands that we have a different history of migration, we do not have the multicultural model that exists in some European countries.&quot;</em></p><p> He made a similar statement to the German newspaper <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/interview-with-andrej-babi-we-have-to-defend-our-civilisation-57111396.bild.html\">Bild</a> on September 10, 2018:</p><p> <em>&quot;I think, we have excellent economic ties - and it goes beyond that. Personally, I have a lot of friends in Germany and have just visited my friend Wolfgang Schäuble, whom I came to know in his capacity as finance minister. To me, he has a great personality. Together with the Chancellor, to a greater or lesser extent, we share the same vision of how to solve the migration issue and the Marshall Plan for Africa, based on the Turkish model. However, we have a different opinion on the distribution of migrants on vessels&quot;</em> .</p><p> However, no similar confirmation of a friendly relationship from Wolfgang Schäuble has been found. It should be noted that no publicly available sources indicate that they could not be friends.</p><p> Despite some controversial issues, mutual relations between the Czech Republic and Germany are good, as demonstrated by the last state <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/rozdelovani-bezencu-je-dal-spornym-bodem-vztahu-cr-a-nemecka/1659425\">visit</a> of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš to Germany in September 2018.<br/><br/></p>\nSECTION D: <p>Since January 2018, pensions have actually <a href=\"https://www.cssz.cz/cz/o-cssz/informace/media/tiskove-zpravy/tiskove-zpravy-2017/2017-12-06-od-ledna-se-valorizuji-vsechny-duchody-cssz-provede-jejich-zvyseni-automaticky.htm\">been valorized</a> . The amount of CZK 475 represents an increase in the average pension, which in September 2017 was CZK 11,828. Therefore, it may be higher or lower for some pension recipients.</p><p> This valorization was approved in September 2017 by the government of Bohuslav Sobotka, i.e. the coalition government.</p><p> The government of Andrej Babiš, which ruled without confidence from December 13, 2017 to June 27, 2018 (i.e. 196 days, which we assess as an insignificant deviation; we leave the assessment of the quality of the government without confidence to the reader) <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/kabinet-andreje-babise-schvalil-navyseni-duchodu-v-prumeru-o-918-korun-mesicne-163624/\">approved</a> the pension insurance amendment in February 2018.</p><p> According to this proposal, pensioners will actually receive an average <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2403196-zmeny-v-duchodech-prosly-vladou-budou-stat-kolem-14-miliard-korun\">increase</a> of CZK 918 (CZK 540 each plus the rest according to the merit part of the pension) from January 2019. The increase in pensions will be an average of CZK 598,&quot; informed the outgoing head of the state treasury, Alena Schillerová (for ANO).<br/><br/> Pensioners over 85 years of age receive an additional CZK 1,000.</p><p> The deputies <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2572831-zive-poslanci-nejspis-podpori-vladni-verzi-zvysovani-duchodu\">agreed</a> to approve the change in pension amounts in August 2018, but the president&#39;s signature is still awaited.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>After Jan Mládek&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/11412378947-90-ct24/217411058130220/obsah/525285-odvolani-jana-mladka-uvod\">dismissal</a> from the post of Minister of Industry and Trade, announced by Bohuslav Sobotka on February 20, 2017, Tomáš Prouza was considered one of the potential candidates for the post of Minister. When asked whether Miloš Zeman would have any reservations if Bohuslav Sobotka proposed Prouza as the new Minister of Industry and Trade, the President replied: <em>&quot;First of all, I would ask whether Mr. Prouza knows anything about Czech industry at all.&quot;</em> The President&#39;s spokesman, Jiří Ovčáček, also <a href=\"https://echo24.cz/a/w5sWy/ovcacek-prouza-ma-blizko-k-organizacim-utocicim-na-zemana\">expressed his</a> negative opinion against Prouza on his Twitter: <em>&quot;He is famous for his close relationship with political non-profit organizations that purposefully attack the President and feed on</em> the &#39; <em>fight against propaganda</em> &#39; <em>.&quot;</em> <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sobotka-se-ted-nechtel-stretnout-s-prezidentem-rikaji-social/r~e36f0374fa9311e6b2310025900fea04/\">Aktualne.cz</a> also reported that Sobotka does not want a clash with the President.</p><p> The Czech Justice website also <a href=\"https://www.ceska-justice.cz/blog/nejmenovani-ministra/\">confirms</a> that then-Prime Minister Sobotka first informally proposed Tomáš Prouz to the president for the post of Minister of Industry and Trade, after which the president rejected him.</p><p> After a meeting with President Bohuslav Sobotka on February 25, 2017, <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sobotka-se-ted-nechtel-stretnout-s-prezidentem-rikaji-social/r~e36f0374fa9311e6b2310025900fea04/\">he announced</a> that he would temporarily lead the ministry himself. In early March, Tomáš Prouza <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/tomas-prouza-konci-ve-funkci-namestka-pro-evropske-zalezitos/r~6f7dcf7c003311e781eb0025900fea04/\">resigned</a> from his position as Deputy Head of the European Affairs Section at the Government Office and left for the private sector.</p><p> On 5 May 2017, Bohuslav Sobotka proposed <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2109644-sobotka-si-demisi-nakonec-rozmyslel-na-hrad-poslal-navrh-s-odvolanim-babise\">the dismissal</a> of Andrej Babiš from the post of Minister of Finance, after a previous unsuccessful attempt to submit the resignation of the entire government, due to Babiš&#39;s case of purchasing crown bonds and uncertainties regarding the acquisition of his property. Miloš Zeman was <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/politika/zeman-se-dnes-seznami-s-navrhem-na-odvolani-babise/r~fc54753a33b511e7a70b002590604f2e/\">reluctant</a> <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/vladni-krize-babis-sobotka-zeman-otocky-zmeny-postoju-prehled.A170517_113104_domaci_jw\">to dismiss</a> Andrej Babiš - on 5 May, Hrad <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2109644-sobotka-si-demisi-nakonec-rozmyslel-na-hrad-poslal-navrh-s-odvolanim-babise\">stated</a> that Andrej Babiš could not be dismissed because it would violate the coalition agreement, and on 11 May in Doksy <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/vladni-krize-babis-sobotka-zeman-otocky-zmeny-postoju-prehled.A170517_113104_domaci_jw\"></a> the president indicated that it would be acceptable if both Prime Minister Sobotka and then Minister Babiš left the government. Andrej Babiš indeed admitted on May 6 that he would leave the government and that he had a possible successor selected, namely Alena Schillerová, which Sobotka rejected. Subsequently, Ivan Pilný was <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/navrh-na-jmenovani-pilneho-ministrem-misto-babise-dorazil-na-hrad.A170518_100404_domaci_kop\">proposed to</a> replace Andrej Babiš, with whom Prime Minister Sobotka agreed and therefore sent the president a proposal to dismiss Andrej Babiš from the post of Minister of Finance together with a proposal to appoint Ivan Pilný in his place.</p><p> It is therefore not true that Andrej Babiš resigned from his post. The then Finance Minister Babiš was <a href=\"https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-65741440-babis-dorazil-na-hrad-zeman-ho-odvola-z-funkce-odchodu-z-vlady-nelituji-vztahy-v-ni-jsou-narusene-rekl-koncici-ministr\">dismissed</a> by the president at the suggestion of Prime Minister Sobotka, after previous disputes between Bohuslav Sobotka and the president and Andrej Babiš himself over his successor.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>Václav Havel delivered his <a href=\"https://www.vaclavhavel.cz/cs/vaclav-havel/dilo/projevy#yr1989\">third</a> New Year&#39;s presidential address on January 1, 1992, at Prague Castle. The speech began with the following <a href=\"http://www.darius.cz/ag_nikola/cl_havel_4.html\">words</a> : <em>&quot;Dear fellow citizens, I have been asking myself this fundamental question for some time now: why, at a time when no foreign power threatens us or interferes in our affairs, and we</em> - <em>as a state and as citizens</em> - <em>truly have our destiny in our own hands for the first time in centuries, do we have so few reasons for joyful satisfaction?&quot;</em><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
