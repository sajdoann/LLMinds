I requested from the Ministry of Finance a list of goods and services where VAT was reduced during our period. This (passenger transport, note Demagog.cz) was the only item where we did not do it (we did not vote for a VAT reduction, note Demagog.cz), because transport companies would make money from it without it being reflected in reduced fares for people.
