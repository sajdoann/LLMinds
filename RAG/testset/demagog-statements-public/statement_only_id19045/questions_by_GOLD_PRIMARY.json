When asked whether Miloš Zeman would have any reservations if Bohuslav Sobotka proposed Prouza as the new Minister of Industry and Trade, the President replied: <em>&quot;First of all, I would ask whether Mr. Prouza knows anything about Czech industry at all.&quot;</em> The President&#39;s spokesman, Jiří Ovčáček, also <a href=\"https://echo24.cz/a/w5sWy/ovcacek-prouza-ma-blizko-k-organizacim-utocicim-na-zemana\">expressed his</a> negative opinion against Prouza on his Twitter: <em>&quot;He is famous for his close relationship with political non-profit organizations that purposefully attack the President and feed on</em> the &#39; <em>fight against propaganda</em> &#39; <em>.&quot;</em> <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sobotka-se-ted-nechtel-stretnout-s-prezidentem-rikaji-social/r~e36f0374fa9311e6b2310025900fea04/\">Aktualne.cz</a> also reported that Sobotka does not want a clash with the President.</p><p> The Czech Justice website also <a href=\"https://www.ceska-justice.cz/blog/nejmenovani-ministra/\">confirms</a> that then-Prime Minister Sobotka first informally proposed Tomáš Prouz to the president for the post of Minister of Industry and Trade, after which the president rejected him.</p><p> After a meeting with President Bohuslav Sobotka on February 25, 2017, <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sobotka-se-ted-nechtel-stretnout-s-prezidentem-rikaji-social/r~e36f0374fa9311e6b2310025900fea04/\">he announced</a> that he would temporarily lead the ministry himself.

Miloš Zeman was <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/politika/zeman-se-dnes-seznami-s-navrhem-na-odvolani-babise/r~fc54753a33b511e7a70b002590604f2e/\">reluctant</a> <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/vladni-krize-babis-sobotka-zeman-otocky-zmeny-postoju-prehled.A170517_113104_domaci_jw\">to dismiss</a> Andrej Babiš - on 5 May, Hrad <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2109644-sobotka-si-demisi-nakonec-rozmyslel-na-hrad-poslal-navrh-s-odvolanim-babise\">stated</a> that Andrej Babiš could not be dismissed because it would violate the coalition agreement, and on 11 May in Doksy <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/vladni-krize-babis-sobotka-zeman-otocky-zmeny-postoju-prehled.A170517_113104_domaci_jw\"></a> the president indicated that it would be acceptable if both Prime Minister Sobotka and then Minister Babiš left the government. Andrej Babiš indeed admitted on May 6 that he would leave the government and that he had a possible successor selected, namely Alena Schillerová, which Sobotka rejected. Subsequently, Ivan Pilný was <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/navrh-na-jmenovani-pilneho-ministrem-misto-babise-dorazil-na-hrad.A170518_100404_domaci_kop\">proposed to</a> replace Andrej Babiš, with whom Prime Minister Sobotka agreed and therefore sent the president a proposal to dismiss Andrej Babiš from the post of Minister of Finance together with a proposal to appoint Ivan Pilný in his place.</p><p> It is therefore not true that Andrej Babiš resigned from his post. The then Finance Minister Babiš was <a href=\"https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-65741440-babis-dorazil-na-hrad-zeman-ho-odvola-z-funkce-odchodu-z-vlady-nelituji-vztahy-v-ni-jsou-narusene-rekl-koncici-ministr\">dismissed</a> by the president at the suggestion of Prime Minister Sobotka, after previous disputes between Bohuslav Sobotka and the president and Andrej Babiš himself over his successor.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Václav Havel delivered his <a href=\"https://www.vaclavhavel.cz/cs/vaclav-havel/dilo/projevy#yr1989\">third</a> New Year&#39;s presidential address on January 1, 1992, at Prague Castle. The speech began with the following <a href=\"http://www.darius.cz/ag_nikola/cl_havel_4.html\">words</a> : <em>&quot;Dear fellow citizens, I have been asking myself this fundamental question for some time now: why, at a time when no foreign power threatens us or interferes in our affairs, and we</em> - <em>as a state and as citizens</em> - <em>truly have our destiny in our own hands for the first time in centuries, do we have so few reasons for joyful satisfaction?&quot;</em><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\nSECTION C: <p>Since January 2018, pensions have actually <a href=\"https://www.cssz.cz/cz/o-cssz/informace/media/tiskove-zpravy/tiskove-zpravy-2017/2017-12-06-od-ledna-se-valorizuji-vsechny-duchody-cssz-provede-jejich-zvyseni-automaticky.htm\">been valorized</a> . The amount of CZK 475 represents an increase in the average pension, which in September 2017 was CZK 11,828. Therefore, it may be higher or lower for some pension recipients.</p><p> This valorization was approved in September 2017 by the government of Bohuslav Sobotka, i.e. the coalition government.</p><p> The government of Andrej Babiš, which ruled without confidence from December 13, 2017 to June 27, 2018 (i.e. 196 days, which we assess as an insignificant deviation; we leave the assessment of the quality of the government without confidence to the reader) <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/kabinet-andreje-babise-schvalil-navyseni-duchodu-v-prumeru-o-918-korun-mesicne-163624/\">approved</a> the pension insurance amendment in February 2018.</p><p> According to this proposal, pensioners will actually receive an average <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2403196-zmeny-v-duchodech-prosly-vladou-budou-stat-kolem-14-miliard-korun\">increase</a> of CZK 918 (CZK 540 each plus the rest according to the merit part of the pension) from January 2019. The increase in pensions will be an average of CZK 598,&quot; informed the outgoing head of the state treasury, Alena Schillerová (for ANO).<br/><br/> Pensioners over 85 years of age receive an additional CZK 1,000.</p><p> The deputies <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2572831-zive-poslanci-nejspis-podpori-vladni-verzi-zvysovani-duchodu\">agreed</a> to approve the change in pension amounts in August 2018, but the president&#39;s signature is still awaited.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>The petition &quot;Uncultured Minister&quot; addressed to Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and Chairman of the ČSSD Jan Hamáček was created in Prague on <a href=\"https://www.nekulturniministr.cz/\">April 24,</a> 2019. The signatories call on the Prime Minister to propose to the President of the Republic the dismissal of Antonín Staněk from the position of Minister of Culture. They then ask Chairman Hamáček that the ČSSD, as a coalition partner of ANO, support the dismissal of Antonín Staněk from the position of Minister of Culture. According to the authors of the petition, Minister Staněk should be dismissed <a href=\"https://www.nekulturniministr.cz/\">due to</a> <strong>&quot;</strong> <em>incompetence, loss of trust and failure (...) in the position of the highest government representative in the field of culture.&quot;</em> The initiators and signatories of the petition subsequently <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/pr/index_view.php?id=1751827\">granted</a> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš&#39;s request for a meeting. They presented their demands to him <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/petice-proti-ministru-kultury-stankovi-babis-hamacek.A190502_213523_domaci_cern\">on May 2</a> at the Government Office. The Chairman of the ČSSD Jan Hamáček also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrejBabis/status/1124178809488592896\">attended</a> the meeting.</p><p> Vice-Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary Roman Onderka <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/219411030500428/\">said</a> in the Czech Television&#39;s Questions with Václav Moravec on April 28th <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/219411030500428/\"></a> (time 7:37) that he would consider Staněk&#39;s end in the cabinet. In the event that Minister Staněk does not justify his actions, according to Onderka, it is appropriate for the Social Democrats to consider a replacement within this ministry. Therefore, it is not true that he would directly demand Staněk&#39;s resignation.<em> </em>Two days earlier, Minister Staňek was supported by the chairman of the ČSSD, Hamáček: &quot; <em>I am not planning a change in the post of Minister of Culture,&quot;</em> <a href=\"https://denikn.cz/minuta/117249/\">he wrote to</a> Deník N at the time.</p><p> From <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/onderka-prezident-uz-mel-stanka-odvolat-ustava-neni-trhaci-k/r~20d3961e9e6411e9b7740cc47ab5f122/\">the interview</a> of the vice-chairman of the ČSSD, Roman Onderka, for Aktuálně.cz on July 4, 2019, it is clear that he does not like his name being associated with the demand for the resignation of Minister Staněk. When asked by the editor whether Minister of Culture Staněk should leave the government, Onderka replied: &quot; <em>Mr. Moravec asked me if steps were being taken to dismiss Mr. Staněk. I said yes, but it was not as the headlines said, that Onderka wanted to dismiss Staněk.&quot;</em></p>\nSECTION E: <p>We interpret the term “our period” as the period when the ANO movement ruled in a minority cabinet after the elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the autumn of 2017. Taking into account a certain amount of time to form a government, we examined the changes in the Value Added Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Act”) from 1 January 2018. Since this period, VAT has been reduced under three amendments. These were Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll., Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">6/2019</a> Coll.</p><p> Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> Coll. were government bills that introduced a reduction in VAT on a wide range of goods and services. What did not escape great media attention was the reduction in the rate on beer.</p><p> List of goods and services for which the VAT rate was reduced by Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll.:</p><ol><li> <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501?text=%C2%A7%2047\">Electronic books</a></li><li> Catering services, serving drinks (VAT on beer is reduced under this item)</li><li> Interior cleaning services performed in households</li><li> Home care for children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled</li><li> Shoe and leather goods repair</li><li> Repairs and alterations of clothing and textile products</li><li> Bicycle repairs</li><li> Hairdressing and barber services</li></ol><p> As part of Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=68877\">80/2019</a> Coll. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=104.\">, &quot;heat and cold</a> &quot; was moved from the first reduced rate (15%) to the second reduced rate (10%).</p><p> Since these were government amendments to the law, it is understandable that they were <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=70948\">supported</a> by the ANO movement. Deputies from the ČSSD and the KSČM, which supports the government, also <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=69368&amp;l=cz\">voted</a> for the proposals. In fact, not a single deputy was against the amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> .</p><p> The amendment to the VAT Act No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">6/2019</a> Coll. was adopted in the Chamber of Deputies as <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=140\">a parliamentary proposal</a> by deputies from the STAN movement. It also contains a reduced rate for regular land public passenger transport, which Andrej Babiš talks about in his statement. In the Chamber of Deputies, this amendment <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=68622&amp;l=cz\">was not supported</a> by the ANO movement and deputies from the ČSSD, the vast majority of whom abstained from voting.</p><p> Regular ground public passenger transport has therefore <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">moved</a> from the first reduced rate (15%) to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-235?text=p%C5%99%C3%ADloha%20%C4%8D.%202a\">the second</a> reduced rate (10%). However, carriers have made it clear that the reduction in the rate will not bring a reduction in prices. For example, Leo Express spokesman Emil Sedlařík <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/\">told</a> Aktuálně.cz: <em>&quot;The reduction in the VAT rate comes at the same time as an increase in the prices of traction electricity, wages and other cost items. Thanks to the reduction in the VAT rate, we can better cover these increased expenses, which will not affect the price of our tickets.&quot;</em> Radek Joklík, spokesman for Czech Railways, made a similar <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/\">statement</a> .<br/><br/> For the reasons stated above, we evaluate the statement as true.<br/><br/></p>\nSECTION F: <p>Vladimír Kremlík <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/vladimir-kremlik-173245/\">was</a> Minister of Transport from April 29, 2019 to January 23, 2020.</p><p> Former Minister Kremlík <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/nabidli-mi-uplatek-15-milionu-rekl-kremlik-babis-mlci-ale-bis-to-vi-88094\">allegedly</a> met with lawyer Martin Janoušek at the ministry&#39;s headquarters on December 20, 2019. Janoušek allegedly offered a bribe of 1.5 million crowns for CGI to retain oversight of the toll system.</p><p> 25 days later, specifically on January 14, Vladimír Kremlík was supposed to send a report to the director of the Security Information Service about the situation that had arisen. According to the Seznam news server, Vladimír Kremlík was supposed <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3043235-podivna-situace-kremlik-pry-jako-ministr-dostal-korupcni-nabidku-padla-uz-tri-trestni\">to file</a> a criminal complaint on Monday, February 3, 2020.</p><p> According to <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/kremlik-odvolani-uplatek-transparency-international-bis-policie_2002041632_aur\">the statement</a> of the Transparency International lawyer, the alleged criminal report was filed late. In the interview, it is said that, according to the interpretation of the law, a crime must be reported within a maximum of a few days. Similarly, the commentary to the Criminal Code (Šámal et al., CH Beck, 2012) states that <em>“reporting an act without delay means that a person who has reliably learned that one of the crimes listed in this provision has been committed takes the earliest opportunity to report it.”</em> In any case, <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2009-40#f3921514\">the law</a> itself, specifically in Section 368 of the Criminal Code, does not explicitly state the time within which a crime must be reported. However, from the interpretation of the provisions of the Criminal Code, it can be concluded that the former Minister Kremlík did indeed report the crime late.</p><p> As for the actual reporting of a crime, anyone can report a crime. They can do so orally, in writing, electronically or in another way. A crime can be <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2009-40#p368-1\">reported</a> to any police authority or to the public prosecutor&#39;s office. Let us therefore focus on whether former Minister Kremlík reported the crime to the relevant authority, or whether his SMS message to the Director of the BIS can be considered a report to a police authority. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1961-141#p12-2-f\">Section 12, paragraph 2, letter f)</a> of Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Code of Criminal Procedure, a police authority includes, among other things, the authorized bodies of the Security Information Service in proceedings concerning crimes committed by members of the Security Information Service. Since <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/inspekce/\">the BIS Inspectorate</a> , as a police authority, is directly subordinate to the Director of the BIS, it is valid that Vladimír Kremlík reported the crime to a police authority within the meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p><p> However, in order to evaluate the statement, it is important to clarify whether by the term “reported” Andrej Babiš means reporting a crime under the Criminal Code, or generally passing on information about a suspicion of committing a crime to a third party. Since Andrej Babiš did not use the word “report” as used in criminal law, we assume that by reporting he means a simple communication to another person, not necessarily to an authority involved in criminal proceedings and not necessarily within the time limit required by the Criminal Code. Since, according to the available information, the former Minister Kremlík should have reported his suspicions to the Director of the BIS, and indeed after about three weeks, as Andrej Babiš himself admitted, we evaluate the statement as true.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
