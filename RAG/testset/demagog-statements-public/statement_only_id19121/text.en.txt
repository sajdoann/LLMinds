We pointed out that when it&#39;s from one plane, when firefighters are going to that region, because they&#39;re taking care of other regional hospitals, social care institutions, and so on, because that&#39;s the task of the regional distribution, it doesn&#39;t seem logical to us that the fire brigade convoy should be followed by a convoy from the Ministry of Health, or rather the army, which is transporting it for them, carrying the same thing from the same plane to more or less the same place.
