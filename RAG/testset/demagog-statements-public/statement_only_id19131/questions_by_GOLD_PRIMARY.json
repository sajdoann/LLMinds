Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The first information about the order for 1.1 million respirators and 5 million masks from China appeared on March 15 on Jan Hamáček&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhamacek/status/1239161035816415233\">Twitter account</a> .</p><p> According to <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/ministerstvo-zdravotnictvi-neumelo-rousky-objednat-pomohl-ty/r~d5fe94d8689111ea9c800cc47ab5f122/\">Aktuálně.cz</a> , this was supposed to happen after Prime Minister Andrej Babiš entrusted the Ministry of the Interior with the purchase of respirators and masks. This is allowed by Act <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-240#p4-1-b\">No. 240/2000 Coll.</a> The reason was the inability of the Ministry of Health to order this equipment.</p><p> <i>&quot;So we have a fast payment system and I can tell you that we now have more than 30 million masks, 6 million respirators, 250,000 protective biosuits for doctors and medical staff, and 250,000 glasses and shields paid for and under contract in China. This is something that should fundamentally change the situation.&quot;</i> This was the statement of the Minister of the Interior on March 17 at <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-po-mimoradnem-jednani-vlady--17--brezna-2020-180412/\">a press conference</a> after an extraordinary government meeting. According to this statement, the number of equipment ordered from China has increased.</p><p> So far, the latest information with a higher number of protective equipment was heard on March 22 in <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/220411030500322/\">Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions</a> (time 26:25).

The only difference here is the number of protective suits, where Info.cz states the number of 300,000, instead of the 250,000 announced by Jan Hamáček.</p><p> Information about the contract for face masks, FFP2 respirators, goggles, protective shields, or disposable tests is not searchable in <a href=\"https://smlouvy.gov.cz\">the contract register</a> .</p>\nSECTION B: <p>The competence and appointment process mentioned in the statement are in accordance with the wording of the law and the details regarding the selection procedure correspond to reality (even taking into account the minor numerical deviation, which must be assessed in the context of the statement).</p><p> The process of appointing the Director of the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS) is stated <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2011-341#p1-2\">in Section 1, Paragraph 2 of the Act</a> on the General Inspectorate of Security Forces and on Amendments to Related Acts:</p><p> “ <em>The Inspectorate is headed by the Director of the Inspectorate (hereinafter referred to as the “Director”), who is appointed and dismissed</em> <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2011-341?text=f#f4410405\"><strong><em>1)</em></strong></a> <em>by the Prime Minister, upon a proposal from the Government and after discussion in the Committee of the Chamber of Deputies responsible for security matters, to whom the Director is accountable for the performance of his/her duties.</em> ”</p><p> The vacant position of head of GIBS was vacated after the institution&#39;s second-in-command, Michael Murín, decided <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/murin-skonci-v-cele-gibs_1804170928_miz\">to resign</a> from his position after disputes with Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, who also <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/michal-murin-generalni-inspekce-gibs-andrej-babis-kazenske-rizeni_1803120730_hm\">imposed</a> disciplinary proceedings against him.</p><p> He officially <a href=\"http://www.gibs.cz/zpravodajsky-servis/tiskove-zpravy/rezignace-plk-judr-michala-murina-na-funkci-reditele-generalni-inspekce-bezpecnostnich-sboru\">justified</a> his departure by saying that his “ <em>remaining at the head of GIBS</em> <em>could give rise to unjustified questioning of the results of its work.</em> ” 12 candidates <a href=\"https://zpravy.idnes.cz/vlada-vyberove-rizeni-gibs-reditel-michal-murin-policie-pj8-/domaci.aspx?c=A180629_154404_domaci_bja\">applied</a> for the second selection procedure for the post of new director (when the first one was closed due to only one candidate).
