On August 21, 1968, in the afternoon, she was <a href=\"http://okupace.evangnet.cz/kosanova-margita\">hit</a> by fire from Soviet soldiers on the steps of Comenius University in Bratislava. With a serious injury to her lumbar region, she was transported to the II.

After taking the oath, Miloš Zeman <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CT24.cz/videos/386820792025695/\">said</a> , among other things:</p><p> &quot; <em>What is the broad path that leads every minister of culture into oblivion? The fact that he goes to various receptions, openings, premieres, festivals, and so on, and so on. Sometimes he awards a grant or subsidy, and of course the media sphere applauds him. Cultural monuments, Mr. Minister, do not applaud. Cultural monuments are silent and decay. Yet these monuments are the minutiae of the Czech landscape. And we have been unable to supplement these minutiae, which were created by our ancestors, with almost nothing else. It is our shame, but let us at least try to save what others have built.</em> &quot;</p><p> The National Heritage Institute <a href=\"https://www.npu.cz/pamatkovy-fond\">states</a> that there are over 700 dilapidated cultural monuments in the Czech Republic out of a total of 40,000.

The head of the ČSSD, Jan Hamáček <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2827265-prezident-neprijal-demisi-ministra-kultury-stanka\">, said</a> that he would therefore ask Prime Minister Babiš to propose to the president the dismissal of Antonín Staňek from office. In such a case, President Zeman would have to dismiss Antonín Staňek according to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl74\">Article 74 of Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll. of the Constitution</a> of the Czech Republic.

The new minister of culture&#39;s <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2907302-zive-prezident-jmenuje-lubomira-zaoralka-ministrem-kultury\">priorities</a> include, among other things, increasing salaries in culture and overall stabilization of the department.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>President Miloš Zeman <a href=\"https://www.barrandov.tv/video/167732-tyden-s-prezidentem-24-10-2019\">stated</a> the following on TV Barrandov on October 24, 2019 (time 6:27): <em>&quot;Let Mr. Koudelka focus on economic crime in the Czech Republic instead of fictitiously chasing Russian and Chinese spies.&quot;</em></p><p> The President also responded to <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2955386-tajne-sluzby-rozbily-sit-kterou-v-cesku-vytvareli-rusove\">the speech</a> of the Director of the Security Information Service, Michal Koudelka, in the Chamber of Deputies on October 21, 2019. He stated that the BIS and the National Center for Organized Crime (NCOZ) had last year uncovered and dismantled a spy network that was being built in the Czech Republic by the Russian intelligence service. The Russian Embassy denied this claim.</p><p> The BIS <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/vyrocni-zpravy/vyrocni-zprava-bezpecnostni-informacni-sluzby-za-rok-2017-d85907e6.html\">annual report</a> from 2017 also talks about Russian and Chinese influence. The report talks about two cyberattacks on <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/public/site/bis.cz/content/vyrocni-zpravy/2017-vz-cz.pdf\">the Foreign Ministry</a> (.pdf, pp. 15-16), about the &quot;infiltration&quot; of the Russian diplomatic mission by people with contacts in intelligence services (pp. 6-8), but also about disinformation websites (pp. 7-8).</p><p> A BIS spokesperson <a href=\"https://denikn.cz/minuta/221224/\">defended himself</a> against Miloš Zeman&#39;s statement of October 24, 2019, saying: <em>&quot;The fight against corruption is not within the legal competence of the BIS. This issue is addressed by special units of the Czech Police.&quot;</em></p><p> The status and scope of the BIS are determined by Act <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153\">No. 153/1994 Coll.</a> on the Intelligence Services of the Czech Republic. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153#p5-1-d\">Section 5,</a> the BIS provides information on activities whose consequences may threaten the security or significant economic interests of the Czech Republic. According to the official website of the BIS, a significant economic interest <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/ekonomicke-zajmy-statu/\">is understood to be</a> an interest in the functionality of systems with a broad economic reach and in the optimal management of assets, the loss of which could threaten the basic functions of the state. <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1993ps/tisky/t101600.htm\">The explanatory memorandum</a> to the Act on Intelligence Services speaks of the need to &quot; <em>detect through intelligence efforts also efforts directed against the mechanisms of the financial and economic functioning of the state in cases where their consequences may damage the interests of the Czech Republic&quot;.</em> These economic interests may be influenced, among other things, by illegal activities, which can include corruption, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the law or on the BIS website.</p><p> It cannot be ruled out that a specific case of corruption that would significantly threaten the economic interests of the Czech Republic could fall within the scope of the BIS. However, in general, the fight against economic crime is not within the scope of the BIS. This is investigated by specialized units of the Czech Police, <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/uokfk-skpv-utvar-odhalovani-korupce-a-financni-kriminality-skpv.aspx\"></a> for example, the Corruption and Financial Crime Detection <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/uokfk-skpv-utvar-odhalovani-korupce-a-financni-kriminality-skpv.aspx\">Unit</a> or the Organized Crime Detection <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/utvar-pro-odhalovani-organizovaneho-zlocinu-skpv-199737.aspx\">Unit</a> of the SKPV.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>President Miloš Zeman, at a meeting with foreign ambassadors on October 27, 2019, did indeed begin <a href=\"https://www.hrad.cz/cs/prezident-cr/soucasny-prezident-cr/vybrane-projevy-a-rozhovory/projev-prezidenta-republiky-pri-setkani-se-cleny-diplomatickeho-sboru-15112\">his speech</a> with almost identical words: <em>&quot;Distinguished ambassadors, dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends of the Czech Republic, welcome to a successful country! Welcome to a country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, stable economic growth, and very low national debt.&quot;</em> He did not mention the declining national debt at the time.</p><p> We consider the opening words to be true in terms of content as well. The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is indeed the lowest in the European Union. According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics\">Eurostat data from October 2019</a> , it is 2.2%, while the average unemployment rate in the EU-28 is 6.3%.</p><p> If we measure economic growth by GDP, then the Czech Republic is truly in a period of growth. According to <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/92010940/chmu100119.xlsx/d8a25f9f-e671-4fd1-a1f7-0b090610fbbd?version=1.0\">Czech Statistical Office data</a> (.xlsx), GDP has been growing by at least 2.5% year-on-year since 2013.</p><p> President Miloš Zeman says that the state debt is relatively decreasing and low. It is true that in relative terms of state debt to GDP, the debt is indeed decreasing. As can be seen <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">in Eurostat data</a> , this trend has been evident since 2013, when the debt was at 44.9%. In 2018, the share of state debt to GDP was 32.6%. However, in absolute numbers, state debt is not clearly decreasing, on the contrary, it is rather fluctuating, which can be traced <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/rizeni-statniho-dluhu/dluhova-statistika/struktura-a-vyvoj-statniho-dluhu\">in the data of the Ministry of Finance</a> . According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">Eurostat data,</a> the debt of the Czech Republic is one of the lowest in the EU. The average share of state debt to GDP in the EU is 80.4%. Estonia and Bulgaria, for example, have lower relative state debt than the Czech Republic.</p><p> The average wage growth is reported <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/prace_a_mzdy_prace\">by the Czech Statistical Office</a> . In the 3rd quarter of 2019, the average wage reached CZK 33,697 (increased by 6.9% year-on-year).</p><p> The growth of old-age pensions can be monitored, for example, <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/statni-rozpocet/hospodareni-systemu-duchodoveho-pojisten\">on data from the Ministry of Finance</a> . In 2016, the average old-age pension was CZK 11,460, in 2017 it was CZK 11,850, and in 2018 the average old-age pension reached CZK 12,418.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>General Motors is an American multinational corporation that is one of the world&#39;s largest car manufacturers. However, it ran into major problems, among other things due to the effects of the global economic crisis of 2008. GM has had enough of its own problems over the past decade, such as a constantly declining market share, with the price per share gradually <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/05/31/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy_looms/index.htm?postversion=2009053112\">falling</a> to almost 75 cents. </p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/chart_gm_shrinking.03.gif\"><figcaption> Source: <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/\">CNN</a></figcaption></figure><p> But the Great Recession also meant that car sales dropped significantly. All of these factors led GM to declare <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/ceska-ekonomika/obri-bankrot-automobilky-je-tu-gm-chce-ochranu/r~i:article:638814/?redirected=1532723355\">bankruptcy</a> on June 1, 2009. On the same day, the company filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. The administration of then-President Barack Obama bailed out GM with a nearly $50 billion <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">injection</a> of cash, for which it acquired a 60.8% stake in the company. Canada also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1405425-automobilka-general-motors-zbankrotovala\">bought</a> part of the company, and the United Auto Workers union bought another part. The United States then gradually sold off this stake, for which it collected $39 billion. The last part of its stake <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/12/09/government-treasury-gm-general-motors-tarp-bailout-exit-sale/3925515/\">was sold by</a> the United States in December 2013.</p><p> General Motors remained in bankruptcy for only 39 days and soon returned to the stock market thanks to reorganization. As part of the restructuring, the company <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">stopped</a> production of some unprofitable brands such as Hummer, Pontiac and Saturn. The company also closed some of its factories and focused on a narrower selection of brands - such as Chevrolet and Cadillac. The US entry into car manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler ultimately saved 1.5 million jobs. It is estimated that the US <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-bailout-study-idUSL1N0JO0XU20131209\">saved</a> $ 105 billion in collecting social security payments and social benefits for people who would have lost their jobs due to the bankruptcy.</p><p> The Czech Republic can help Czech companies in this way. <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66746670-vlada-hodla-vstoupit-do-vyznamnych-soukromych-firem\">According to</a> Deputy Prime Minister Karel Havlíček, this would be a similar model to that outlined by Miloš Zeman using the example of the USA and General Motors. &quot; <i>We call it the American model, it is not socialization, as we are now being criticized a lot.&quot;</i> Many states are trying to save their strategic companies in this way, as are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesasquith/2020/04/01/could-airlines-be-nationalised-as-italy-takes-full-ownership-of-alitalia-will-more-airlines-follow/#59f3640877df\">airlines</a> .</p><p> Finance Minister Alena Schillerová and the government of Andrej Babiš have <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66751220-schillerova-chce-zestatnovat\">proposed</a> that shares in some Czech companies, such as CSA, should be bought back and then <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66749800-deficit-200-miliard-i-pristi-rok\">sold</a> again, following the American model. Czech Airlines <a href=\"https://www.lidovky.cz/byznys/doprava/zachrana-csa-verdikt-zrejme-padne-do-dvou-tydnu.A200416_130657_ln-doprava_ele\">is</a> currently 98 percent owned by Smartwings, 49 percent of which is owned by the Chinese state-owned company CITIC. However, this proposal is criticized by many economists and experts who do not consider CSA to be a strategic enterprise, and <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/koronahelpdesk-e15/v-cesku-zadna-strategicka-firma-ke-znarodneni-neni-shoduje-se-opozice-s-analytiky-1368824\">the opposition</a> is also opposed. Petr Bartoň, the chief economist of the Natland group, compared the situation between CSA and GM for <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/znarodneni-csa-nic-neresi-rika-ekonom-40321128\">Novinky.cz</a> : &quot; <i>The management is not in a state of catastrophic failure and it is not an irreplaceable critical infrastructure. CSA was only prohibited from offering its services. There would be demand, but citizens are prohibited from traveling anywhere. This can be solved with existing programs to maintain economic relations for the rest of the economy. That is, if those programs were sufficient.&quot;</i></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
