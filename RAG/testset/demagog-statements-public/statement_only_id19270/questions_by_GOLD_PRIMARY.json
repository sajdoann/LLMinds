    "Please answer TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWABLE about the text's veracity. In addition write a short summary explaining your answer. If the veracity cannot be determined answer UNKNOWABLE. The first sentence in the response should be TRUE. FALSE. or UNKNOWABLE. eg:UNKNOWABLE.",
    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Jakub Michálek <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/pirati-jakub-michalek-hlasovani-tajna-volba_1911042232_cha\">faced</a> an unsuccessful attempt to dismiss him from the position of First Vice-Chairman of the Pirates at the turn of October and November 2019. In November 2019, he announced that <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/pirati-jakub-michalek-hlasovani-tajna-volba_1911042232_cha\">he would not</a> defend his position as Vice-Chairman and would continue to work in the Chamber of Deputies. He has been <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/detail.sqw?id=6477\">the chairman of</a> the Pirates parliamentary group since October 2017. <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=477&amp;t=49233&amp;fbclid=IwAR3CjlxLyM3wButbNNkQJZXW5XgKCeq4WkJXgZrKibvgYQTMkXuSl3cGYSk#p645886)%20\">He commented</a> on his dismissal on the Pirates forum in a post dated October 24, 2019, as follows:</p><p> <em>&quot;I said some time ago that I would not run again, that I want to fully concentrate on leading the club and leave the work in the republican presidency to someone else who has fresh enthusiasm to move things forward. We have a lot of new, talented representatives and I want to take a break, finish my dissertation and devote more time to my loved ones.&quot;</em></p><p> MP Michálek then actually on January 7, 2020 <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/michalek-zustava-predsedou-poslaneckeho-klubu.html\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/michalek-zustava-predsedou-poslaneckeho-klubu.html\">defended</a> the post of chairman of the Pirates parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, as Michálek&#39;s post on the pirate forum confirms the words of MP Bartoš that Michálek had proclaimed his intention not to defend the post of party vice-chairman even before the case of his dismissal. However, we were unable to find out from public sources whether this was actually the case in the summer of 2019.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Pirate Party National <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/volby/start\">Election Team</a><a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/volby/start\"></a> consists of an election committee and an election coordinator. The functioning of the election committee is regulated by <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/rules/vr#volebni_kampan\">Section 15c</a> of the Election Code. The election committee currently has 6 people and its chairman is Senator <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/lide/lukas-wagenknecht/\">Lukáš Wagenknecht</a> . He was unanimously elected to the position by the members of the election committee at an introductory <a href=\"https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?f=858&amp;t=35968&amp;start=10#p637788\">meeting</a> held on July 19, 2019.</p><p> Other members include <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/lide/karolina-sadilkova/\">Karolína Sadílková</a> (representative of the media department), <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/lide/helena_vondrakova\">Helena Vondráková</a> (coordinator of the Liberec region and representative of the personnel department), <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/lide/petr-fojtik/\">Petr Fojtík</a> , <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/lide/kamil_kubica\">Kamil Kubica</a> and <a href=\"https://cz.linkedin.com/in/ales-krupa-89b23933\">Aleš Krupa</a> . The election coordinator is <a href=\"https://chrudim.pirati.cz/lide/pavel-stepanek//\">Pavel Štěpánek</a> .</p><p> The main <a href=\"https://wiki.pirati.cz/volby/start\">tasks</a> of the election committee include approving the overall strategy and financing of the election campaign and coordinating the election staff. We therefore assess the statement as true.</p><p></p>\nSECTION C: <p>Ivan Bartoš talks here about the so-called &quot;prison&quot; <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/pirati-maji-v-kampani-vezensky-autobus.A170814_114707_domaci_kop\">bus</a> , which the Pirates used as part of their election campaign in the 2017 elections to the Chamber of Deputies.

Among those depicted are indeed people from the ČSSD. Specifically, these are Bohuslav Sobotka, who is connected to the OKD <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2945291-zive-snemovni-komise-k-privatizaci-okd-zverejni-co-zjistila\">case</a> , and David Rath, who was finally <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2852663-soud-vynese-pravomocny-verdikt-v-korupcni-kauze-davida-ratha\">convicted</a> of corruption in 2019 after <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/policiste-zadrzeli-stredoceskeho-hejtmana-davida-ratha-a-dalsich-sedm-lidi_201205151305_akottova\">seven</a> years of detention.</p><p> The last sentence of the statement speaks of <a href=\"https://www.top09.cz/osobnosti/ing-miroslav-kalousek-512.html\">Miroslav Kalousek</a> , who served as Minister of Finance in the second <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2007-cr/mirek-topolanek-2/prehled-ministru-24440/\">government of</a> Mirek Topolánek for <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2013-cr/petr-necas/ing--miroslav-kalousek-74211/\">the KDU-ČSL</a> and then again in <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2010-cr/petr-necas/prehled-byvalych-clenu-vlady-petra-necase-96390/\">the government of</a> Petr Nečas, this time for TOP 09.</p><p> Other politicians depicted on the side of the bus are Andrej Babiš and Jana Nečasová (Nagyová).</p><p></p>\nSECTION D: <p>Lukáš Wagenknecht <a href=\"http://www.nfpk.cz/oznamovatele/4198\">is</a> truly an expert in the fight against corruption. For his work, for example, in 2015 he received the Courage Award from the Anti-Corruption Foundation.</p><p> Wagenknecht was the first deputy at the Ministry of Finance from February<a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/volby/lukas-wagenknecht-andrej-babis-obse-agrofert_1904171355_haf\">2014</a> , when Andrej Babiš was the Minister of Finance. He dismissed him after a year and a quarter, although he also offered him the position of political deputy, which Wagenknecht did not accept.</p><p> In his statement, Ivan Bartoš is apparently referring to <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/babis-odvolal-prvni-namestka-wagenknechta.A150620_070857_domaci_zt\">the conflict</a> between Lukáš Wagenknecht and Andrej Babiš regarding the non-transparent tender procedure for the IT system prepared by the Ministry of Regional Development. This case ultimately <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1608335-brusel-dal-cesku-stopku-na-dotace-na-projekty-za-568-milionu-korun\">led</a> to the suspension of the disbursement of subsidies in the amount of 568 million crowns. However, we will not assess the real reasons for Wagenknecht&#39;s dismissal, because we understandably do not know the real motivation of Prime Minister Babiš.<br/><br/> In 2018, Lukáš Wagenknecht was actually <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/senat/se1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=9&amp;xt=1\">elected</a> senator for the Pirates.</p>\nSECTION E: <p><a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-240\">The Crisis Act</a> (Act No. 240/200 Coll.), which MP Bartoš mentions, envisages the establishment of a Central Crisis Staff in cases of a crisis situation, which is understood to mean:</p><p> &quot; <i>An emergency under the Integrated Rescue System Act, a disruption of critical infrastructure or other danger in which a state of danger, emergency or state of threat to the state is declared (hereinafter referred to as</i> &#39; <i>crisis state</i> &#39; <i>)</i> &quot;<i> </i>( <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-240#p2-1-b\">§ 2, letter b)</a> .</p><p> According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-240#p4-1-c\">Section 4, Paragraph 1, Letter c),</a> the Government &quot; <i>establishes the Central Crisis Staff as its working body to resolve crisis situations</i> &quot; <i>.</i></p><p> The Central Crisis Staff pursuant to Article 2(4) as amended by the Government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/ppov/brs/pracovni-vybory/ustredni-krizovy-stab/statut-2020.pdf\">Resolution</a> (.pdf, page 1) of March 15, 2020, in particular:</p><p> <i>a) ensures operational cooperation with crisis management bodies of international organizations,</i></p><p> <i>b) ensures the assessment of the development of the situation, the content and adequacy of measures taken by administrative authorities and bodies of territorial self-governing units and informs the State Security Council,</i></p><p> <i>c) assesses, discusses and coordinates the adoption of interdepartmental measures proposed by ministries,</i></p><p> <i><strong>d) prepares proposals for measures to resolve the situation for the State Security Council or the government and documents for making decisions requiring approval by the government or, where appropriate, the Parliament of the Czech Republic.</strong></i></p><p> In addition to the chairman of the staff, other members of the staff are the deputies of individual ministers, the chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration, the Police President of the Czech Republic, the Director General of the Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic, the Chief of the General Staff of the Army of the Czech Republic, the Director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security, the Chief Hygienist, the Director of the State Institute of Health and the Head of the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic (. <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/ppov/brs/pracovni-vybory/ustredni-krizovy-stab/statut-2020.pdf\">pdf</a> , p. 2).

On the day of its declaration, Prime Minister Babiš <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-po-mimoradnem-jednani-vlady--12--brezna-2020-180249/\">expressed himself</a> on the method of crisis management during the state of emergency as follows: <i>&quot;We have clearly agreed that this state of emergency is managed by the government. I would be very happy if speculation about how it should be managed and whether it should be managed stopped. We have clearly imposed on the government members to ask the government for prior approval for measures related to the declaration of the state of emergency that a member of the government or the ministry managed by him takes within the scope of his powers, even before they are implemented.&quot;</i></p><p> Until the establishment of the Central Crisis Staff (i.e. between March 12 and 15, 2020), the government decided, for example, on:</p><ul><li> <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/Opatreni-o-zakazu-vstupu-do-CR-a-cestovani-do-rizikovych-zemi_1.pdf\">measures</a> on the ban on entry to the Czech Republic and travel to high-risk countries (.pdf),</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/Opatreni-o-zakazu-poradani-kulturnich--sportovnich-a-dalsich-akci-s-ucasti-nad-30-osob_1.pdf\">measures</a> prohibiting the organization of cultural, sports and other events with the participation of more than 30 people (.pdf),</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/Opatreni-o-docasnem-znovuzavedeni-ochrany-vnitrnich-hranic-CR_1.pdf\">measures</a> on the temporary reintroduction of border protection in the Czech Republic (.pdf)</li><li> <a href=\"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/staty-sveta-s-vysokym-rizikem-prenosu-nakazy/\">expansion</a> of high-risk countries, upon return from which a mandatory fourteen-day quarantine is ordered,</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-prijala-dalsi-mimoradna-opatreni-k-prevenci-sireni-koronaviru--do-karanteny-musi-vsichni-prijizdejici-z-rizikovych-zemi-180298/\">work duties</a> for full-time students of higher vocational and university schools in fields related to social care or social pedagogy and other fields,</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-rozhodla-o-uzavreni-vsech-obchodu-krome-prodejen-potravin--lekaren--drogerii--cerpacich-stanic-a-nekterych-dalsich-180327/\">closure of</a> all shops except food stores, pharmacies, drugstores, gas stations and some others,</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-posiluje-preventivni-opatreni-v-souvislosti-s-koronavirem--uzavira-obchody-a-restaurace-verejnosti-na-dobu-deseti-dnu-180331/\">ban on</a> the presence of the public in catering establishments,</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/rozhodnuti-vlady-o-zakazu-volneho-pohybu-osob-180358/\">prohibition of</a> free movement of persons.</li></ul><p> The Central Crisis Staff <a href=\"https://www.lidovky.cz/domov/vlada-aktivovala-ustredni-krizovy-stab-povede-ho-prymula.A200315_232323_ln_domov_ele\">was</a> activated on March 15, 2020, and Deputy Minister of Health Roman Prymula became its chairman.
