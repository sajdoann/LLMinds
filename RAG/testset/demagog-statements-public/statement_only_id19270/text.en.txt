I found something here that you wrote when the case started. VojtÄ›ch Filip, I quote: &quot;Some so-called&quot; - I don&#39;t understand why so-called - &quot;municipal politicians have the audacity to do without a mandate from the voters&quot; - which they have - &quot;even foreign policy and go against the government of the Czech Republic. When they get into trouble because of it,&quot; - so you admit here that they are in trouble - &quot;they beg for the Czech Police to protect them with taxpayers&#39; money. Their police officers are suddenly not enough for them.&quot; You wrote that in response on Twitter.
