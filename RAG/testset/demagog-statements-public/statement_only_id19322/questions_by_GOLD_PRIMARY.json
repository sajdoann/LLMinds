    "Please answer TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWABLE about the text's veracity. In addition write a short summary explaining your answer. If the veracity cannot be determined answer UNKNOWABLE. The first sentence in the response should be TRUE. FALSE. or UNKNOWABLE. eg:UNKNOWABLE.",
    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The chairman of the KSČM gave <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/vojteh-filip-bolshinstvo-grazhdan-cheshskoj-respubliki-vot-uzhe-75-let-ispytyvayut-chuvstvo-blagodarnosti-k-krasnoj-armii-2/\">an interview</a> to the Russian newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, which was published on May 15, 2020 with the headline &quot; <i>Vojtěch Filip: Most citizens of the Czech Republic have felt gratitude to the Red Army for 75 years</i> .&quot; In addition to the questions themselves, in which the editorial office does not mention Vojtěch Filip&#39;s position, the article also contains a short introduction, in the exact wording:</p><p> <i>&quot;The first deputy chairman of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, Vojtěch Filip, answered the questions of the Rudá hvězda newspaper.&quot;</i> (In the original: <i>&quot;На вопросы газети «Красная звезда» перевод первый местетиль предложение палаты палаты паляты палаты парламента Чешской Республики Vojtekh Filip.&quot;</i> )</p><p> For the sake of completeness, we would like to point out that throughout the entire interview it is not explicitly stated that Vojtěch Filip is also the chairman of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia. This is only apparent from his answers, which contain expressions such as &quot; <i>generally speaking, I can note for the KSČM...&quot;</i> etc.</p><p> The newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/o-gazete/\">has been published</a> since 2018 with the subtitle Newspaper of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and was previously also the central press organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense. It is therefore possible to describe it as a military newspaper, as Vít Rakušan states. His description of this periodical as a magazine is somewhat more problematic, as the aforementioned subtitle already suggests, Krasnaya Zvezda describes itself as a newspaper. Despite this minor discrepancy, however, we generally assess the statement as true.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
