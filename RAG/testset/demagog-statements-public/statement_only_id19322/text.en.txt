I read the article in translation, or rather the interview with Mr. Vice-Chairman Filip, he was of course described in the Russian military magazine as the Vice-Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, he was not there only as the Chairman of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia. He acted as one of the highest constitutional officials and that is how he spoke for that medium.
