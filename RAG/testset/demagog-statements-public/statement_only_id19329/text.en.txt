I am originally a history teacher and I perceive the role of the Vlasovites as very contradictory. I realize that at the end of the war they certainly helped Prague, for example, but overall we cannot see their role as entirely positive, although history always has many interpretations. They are people who opposed Stalin, but at the same time they are people who fought on the side of the Germans.
