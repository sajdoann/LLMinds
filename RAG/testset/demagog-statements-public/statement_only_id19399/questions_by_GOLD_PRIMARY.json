    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>We interpret the term “our period” as the period when the ANO movement ruled in a minority cabinet after the elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the autumn of 2017. Taking into account a certain amount of time to form a government, we examined the changes in the Value Added Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Act”) from 1 January 2018. Since this period, VAT has been reduced under three amendments. These were Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll., Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">6/2019</a> Coll.</p><p> Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> Coll. were government bills that introduced a reduction in VAT on a wide range of goods and services. What did not escape great media attention was the reduction in the rate on beer.</p><p> List of goods and services for which the VAT rate was reduced by Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll.:</p><ol><li> <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501?text=%C2%A7%2047\">Electronic books</a></li><li> Catering services, serving drinks (VAT on beer is reduced under this item)</li><li> Interior cleaning services performed in households</li><li> Home care for children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled</li><li> Shoe and leather goods repair</li><li> Repairs and alterations of clothing and textile products</li><li> Bicycle repairs</li><li> Hairdressing and barber services</li></ol><p> As part of Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=68877\">80/2019</a> Coll. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=104.\">, &quot;heat and cold</a> &quot; was moved from the first reduced rate (15%) to the second reduced rate (10%).</p><p> Since these were government amendments to the law, it is understandable that they were <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=70948\">supported</a> by the ANO movement. Deputies from the ČSSD and the KSČM, which supports the government, also <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=69368&amp;l=cz\">voted</a> for the proposals. In fact, not a single deputy was against the amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> .</p><p> The amendment to the VAT Act No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">6/2019</a> Coll. was adopted in the Chamber of Deputies as <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=140\">a parliamentary proposal</a> by deputies from the STAN movement. It also contains a reduced rate for regular land public passenger transport, which Andrej Babiš talks about in his statement. In the Chamber of Deputies, this amendment <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=68622&amp;l=cz\">was not supported</a> by the ANO movement and deputies from the ČSSD, the vast majority of whom abstained from voting.</p><p> Regular ground public passenger transport has therefore <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">moved</a> from the first reduced rate (15%) to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-235?text=p%C5%99%C3%ADloha%20%C4%8D.%202a\">the second</a> reduced rate (10%). However, carriers have made it clear that the reduction in the rate will not bring a reduction in prices. For example, Leo Express spokesman Emil Sedlařík <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/\">told</a> Aktuálně.cz: <em>&quot;The reduction in the VAT rate comes at the same time as an increase in the prices of traction electricity, wages and other cost items. Thanks to the reduction in the VAT rate, we can better cover these increased expenses, which will not affect the price of our tickets.&quot;</em> Radek Joklík, spokesman for Czech Railways, made a similar <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/\">statement</a> .<br/><br/> For the reasons stated above, we evaluate the statement as true.<br/><br/></p>\nSECTION B: <p>After Jan Mládek&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/11412378947-90-ct24/217411058130220/obsah/525285-odvolani-jana-mladka-uvod\">dismissal</a> from the post of Minister of Industry and Trade, announced by Bohuslav Sobotka on February 20, 2017, Tomáš Prouza was considered one of the potential candidates for the post of Minister. When asked whether Miloš Zeman would have any reservations if Bohuslav Sobotka proposed Prouza as the new Minister of Industry and Trade, the President replied: <em>&quot;First of all, I would ask whether Mr. Prouza knows anything about Czech industry at all.&quot;</em> The President&#39;s spokesman, Jiří Ovčáček, also <a href=\"https://echo24.cz/a/w5sWy/ovcacek-prouza-ma-blizko-k-organizacim-utocicim-na-zemana\">expressed his</a> negative opinion against Prouza on his Twitter: <em>&quot;He is famous for his close relationship with political non-profit organizations that purposefully attack the President and feed on</em> the &#39; <em>fight against propaganda</em> &#39; <em>.&quot;</em> <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sobotka-se-ted-nechtel-stretnout-s-prezidentem-rikaji-social/r~e36f0374fa9311e6b2310025900fea04/\">Aktualne.cz</a> also reported that Sobotka does not want a clash with the President.</p><p> The Czech Justice website also <a href=\"https://www.ceska-justice.cz/blog/nejmenovani-ministra/\">confirms</a> that then-Prime Minister Sobotka first informally proposed Tomáš Prouz to the president for the post of Minister of Industry and Trade, after which the president rejected him.</p><p> After a meeting with President Bohuslav Sobotka on February 25, 2017, <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sobotka-se-ted-nechtel-stretnout-s-prezidentem-rikaji-social/r~e36f0374fa9311e6b2310025900fea04/\">he announced</a> that he would temporarily lead the ministry himself. In early March, Tomáš Prouza <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/tomas-prouza-konci-ve-funkci-namestka-pro-evropske-zalezitos/r~6f7dcf7c003311e781eb0025900fea04/\">resigned</a> from his position as Deputy Head of the European Affairs Section at the Government Office and left for the private sector.</p><p> On 5 May 2017, Bohuslav Sobotka proposed <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2109644-sobotka-si-demisi-nakonec-rozmyslel-na-hrad-poslal-navrh-s-odvolanim-babise\">the dismissal</a> of Andrej Babiš from the post of Minister of Finance, after a previous unsuccessful attempt to submit the resignation of the entire government, due to Babiš&#39;s case of purchasing crown bonds and uncertainties regarding the acquisition of his property. Miloš Zeman was <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/politika/zeman-se-dnes-seznami-s-navrhem-na-odvolani-babise/r~fc54753a33b511e7a70b002590604f2e/\">reluctant</a> <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/vladni-krize-babis-sobotka-zeman-otocky-zmeny-postoju-prehled.A170517_113104_domaci_jw\">to dismiss</a> Andrej Babiš - on 5 May, Hrad <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2109644-sobotka-si-demisi-nakonec-rozmyslel-na-hrad-poslal-navrh-s-odvolanim-babise\">stated</a> that Andrej Babiš could not be dismissed because it would violate the coalition agreement, and on 11 May in Doksy <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/vladni-krize-babis-sobotka-zeman-otocky-zmeny-postoju-prehled.A170517_113104_domaci_jw\"></a> the president indicated that it would be acceptable if both Prime Minister Sobotka and then Minister Babiš left the government. Andrej Babiš indeed admitted on May 6 that he would leave the government and that he had a possible successor selected, namely Alena Schillerová, which Sobotka rejected. Subsequently, Ivan Pilný was <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/navrh-na-jmenovani-pilneho-ministrem-misto-babise-dorazil-na-hrad.A170518_100404_domaci_kop\">proposed to</a> replace Andrej Babiš, with whom Prime Minister Sobotka agreed and therefore sent the president a proposal to dismiss Andrej Babiš from the post of Minister of Finance together with a proposal to appoint Ivan Pilný in his place.</p><p> It is therefore not true that Andrej Babiš resigned from his post. The then Finance Minister Babiš was <a href=\"https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-65741440-babis-dorazil-na-hrad-zeman-ho-odvola-z-funkce-odchodu-z-vlady-nelituji-vztahy-v-ni-jsou-narusene-rekl-koncici-ministr\">dismissed</a> by the president at the suggestion of Prime Minister Sobotka, after previous disputes between Bohuslav Sobotka and the president and Andrej Babiš himself over his successor.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Vladimír Kremlík <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/vladimir-kremlik-173245/\">was</a> Minister of Transport from April 29, 2019 to January 23, 2020.</p><p> Former Minister Kremlík <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/nabidli-mi-uplatek-15-milionu-rekl-kremlik-babis-mlci-ale-bis-to-vi-88094\">allegedly</a> met with lawyer Martin Janoušek at the ministry&#39;s headquarters on December 20, 2019. Janoušek allegedly offered a bribe of 1.5 million crowns for CGI to retain oversight of the toll system.</p><p> 25 days later, specifically on January 14, Vladimír Kremlík was supposed to send a report to the director of the Security Information Service about the situation that had arisen. According to the Seznam news server, Vladimír Kremlík was supposed <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3043235-podivna-situace-kremlik-pry-jako-ministr-dostal-korupcni-nabidku-padla-uz-tri-trestni\">to file</a> a criminal complaint on Monday, February 3, 2020.</p><p> According to <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/kremlik-odvolani-uplatek-transparency-international-bis-policie_2002041632_aur\">the statement</a> of the Transparency International lawyer, the alleged criminal report was filed late. In the interview, it is said that, according to the interpretation of the law, a crime must be reported within a maximum of a few days. Similarly, the commentary to the Criminal Code (Šámal et al., CH Beck, 2012) states that <em>“reporting an act without delay means that a person who has reliably learned that one of the crimes listed in this provision has been committed takes the earliest opportunity to report it.”</em> In any case, <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2009-40#f3921514\">the law</a> itself, specifically in Section 368 of the Criminal Code, does not explicitly state the time within which a crime must be reported. However, from the interpretation of the provisions of the Criminal Code, it can be concluded that the former Minister Kremlík did indeed report the crime late.</p><p> As for the actual reporting of a crime, anyone can report a crime. They can do so orally, in writing, electronically or in another way. A crime can be <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2009-40#p368-1\">reported</a> to any police authority or to the public prosecutor&#39;s office. Let us therefore focus on whether former Minister Kremlík reported the crime to the relevant authority, or whether his SMS message to the Director of the BIS can be considered a report to a police authority. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1961-141#p12-2-f\">Section 12, paragraph 2, letter f)</a> of Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Code of Criminal Procedure, a police authority includes, among other things, the authorized bodies of the Security Information Service in proceedings concerning crimes committed by members of the Security Information Service. Since <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/inspekce/\">the BIS Inspectorate</a> , as a police authority, is directly subordinate to the Director of the BIS, it is valid that Vladimír Kremlík reported the crime to a police authority within the meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p><p> However, in order to evaluate the statement, it is important to clarify whether by the term “reported” Andrej Babiš means reporting a crime under the Criminal Code, or generally passing on information about a suspicion of committing a crime to a third party. Since Andrej Babiš did not use the word “report” as used in criminal law, we assume that by reporting he means a simple communication to another person, not necessarily to an authority involved in criminal proceedings and not necessarily within the time limit required by the Criminal Code. Since, according to the available information, the former Minister Kremlík should have reported his suspicions to the Director of the BIS, and indeed after about three weeks, as Andrej Babiš himself admitted, we evaluate the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>The content of Article 122(2) <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=celex:12016ME/TXT\">of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> corresponds to the operative part.</p><p> <i>Article 122</i></p><p> <i>2. Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with serious difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may grant Union financial assistance to the Member State concerned under certain conditions.

The speech began with the following <a href=\"http://www.darius.cz/ag_nikola/cl_havel_4.html\">words</a> : <em>&quot;Dear fellow citizens, I have been asking myself this fundamental question for some time now: why, at a time when no foreign power threatens us or interferes in our affairs, and we</em> - <em>as a state and as citizens</em> - <em>truly have our destiny in our own hands for the first time in centuries, do we have so few reasons for joyful satisfaction?&quot;</em><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\nSECTION F: <p>In his statement, Andrej Babiš <a href=\"https://www.euroskop.cz/8917/sekce/zakladajici-smlouvy/\">uses</a> the old name of the currently valid Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Treaty of Lisbon changed the name of <a href=\"http://www.euroskop.cz/gallery/2/756-smlouva_o_es_nice.pdf\">the Treaty establishing the European Community</a> to the aforementioned <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN\">Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</a> In this case, this is only a minor error; moreover, Prime Minister Babiš correctly quotes Article 311, which is found in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU):</p><p> <i>&quot;</i> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN\"><i>Article 311</i></a></p><p> <i>The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to achieve its objectives and to successfully implement its policies.</i></p><p> <i>The budget is financed entirely from own resources; other revenues are not affected.</i></p><p> In accordance with the ruling, the European Union <a href=\"https://www.respekt.cz/agenda/prevratny-navrh-unie-si-chce-spolecne-pujcit-na-obnovu-ekonomiky-po-koronaviru\">has not previously borrowed</a> , because, in addition to the fact that, according to Article 311 TFEU, the Union manages only its own resources, according to <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN\">Article 125</a> TFEU, <i>&quot;The Union</i> <i>shall not be liable for or assume the obligations of central governments, regional or local authorities or other public bodies, other bodies governed by public law or public undertakings of any Member State, except in the case of mutual financial guarantees for the joint implementation of a specific project.&quot;</i> Furthermore, according to <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN\">Article 310 TFEU,</a> <i>&quot;the EU budget must be in balance in terms of revenue and expenditure.&quot;</i> These norms of EU primary law <a href=\"https://finmag.penize.cz/ekonomika/417060-unie-si-jde-pujcit-na-financni-trhy-my-nic-my-eu-to-nejaky-fond-z-bruselu\">prohibit</a> EU loans that would adversely affect a balanced EU budget, or a loan to secure the financing of Member States for which the EU is responsible (the EU does not assume the obligations of Member States).</p><p> The European Union as a whole cannot borrow for the time being. However, this does not apply to the European Investment Bank (EIB), which uses the loan to carry out its tasks. However, it is clear from the context of the statement that Andrej Babiš is talking about loans from the EU as a whole and not about the EIB, which has its own legal personality:</p><ul><li> <i>&quot;Article 308 TFEU</i><br> <i>The European Investment Bank shall have legal personality.&#39;</i><br></li><li> Protocol (No 5) to the TFEU on the Statute of the European Investment Bank<br> <i>&quot;</i> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A12016E%2FPRO%2F05\"><i>Article 20</i></a><br> <i>1.

Loan programmes include balance of payments assistance, the European Stability Mechanism and financial assistance to non-EU countries. Assistance is <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/policies/financial-assistance-eurozone-members/\">provided</a> mainly because of the interconnectedness of the economies of the countries and therefore the potential negative impact of a dysfunctional economy of the affected country. In these cases, the Commission acts only as a kind of intermediary between the capital markets and the Member State, where these funds are not used to finance the operation of the Union, but are provided, again as a loan, to the Member State. In contrast, in the case of financing the Next Generation EU programme, the funds are to be used to finance the operation of the Union, or rather to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/about_the_european_commission/eu_budget/2020.2139_cs_04.pdf\">finance</a> subsidies to Member States.</p><p> For the reasons described above, we evaluate the statement as true.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
