The faction supported the proposal of the ANO delegation for a special vote on the individual articles that were controversial. They supported that we would express support for this separate vote, but there was a lot of talk from the majority of the faction, from members who discussed that we are a faction that is based on values, on democracy, on respect for the rule of law, and that therefore the majority intends, regardless of the outcome of the vote on those articles, to vote for the resolution.
