    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Let us begin by stating that <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koalicni-smlouva-vlada-andreje-babise-hnuti-ano-cssd-jan-hamacek-zimola_1805150600_kno\">the coalition agreement</a> signed between ANO and ČSSD contains the general principles of the coalition&#39;s functioning. The individual priorities and goals are then described in the government&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/jednani-vlady/programove-prohlaseni/programove-prohlaseni-vlady-165960/\">program statement</a> , to which the coalition agreement refers. It states the government&#39;s commitment &quot; <em>We will increase the parental allowance to CZK 300,000.&quot;</em> It currently (per child) is <a href=\"https://portal.mpsv.cz/soc/ssp/obcane/rodicovsky_prisp\">CZK 220,000</a> . From 2020, preparations are underway to increase the parental allowance to the aforementioned <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2916452-rodicovska-se-zrejme-vyrazne-zmeni-tak-jako-u-materske-davka-mohla-vychazet-z-vyse\">CZK 300,000</a> .</p><p> There was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit\">agreement</a> across the political spectrum on increasing the parental allowance, however, there was disagreement on the key to increase the parental allowance and for whom. There were three options:</p><ol><li> Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Jana Maláčová (ČSSD) <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit\">proposed</a> that the increased benefit apply to all parents whose children will be under 4 years old as of January 1, 2020. This option would mean an increase in budget costs of CZK 11.2 billion.</li><li> Minister of Finance Alena Schillerová (ANO) <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit\">proposed</a> that the increased benefit apply to all parents who would be actively receiving parental allowance as of January 1, 2020. This option would be more economical by CZK 2.6 billion compared to option 1 and would mean an increase in budget costs by CZK 8.6 billion.</li><li> Another option and compromise <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2768231-komu-se-zvysi-rodicovska-vladni-navrh-se-vraci-na-stul-ministryne-financi\">option</a> resulting from the coalition negotiations was the possibility of increasing the benefit for all parents whose child is born after January 1, 2020. This would represent a saving of approximately CZK 5.5 billion in the state budget compared to option 2 and an increase in budget costs of CZK 3 billion.</li></ol><p> In March, Minister Maláčová <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2764631-rust-rodicovske-a-duchodu-mohla-podporit-i-opozice-ne-ale-variantu-domluvenou-a\">announced</a> that the coalition partners had agreed to implement a third option, which was subsequently denied by both Prime Minister Babiš and MP Maxová, saying that the agreement between the parties was different.</p><p> The individual coalition parties then stood by their proposals (ČSSD for the first option, ANO for the second option) and exchanged messages with each other through the media (e.g. <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2812658-zakon-o-rodicovske-predlozi-cssd-uz-za-tyden-nechceme-aby-se-navyseni-nestihlo\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819351-novy-rozpocet-bude-mit-schodek-40-miliard-sektorova-dan-nebude-banky-ale-maji\">here</a> ). <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2769701-zive-o-kolik-se-zvednou-duchody-o-jejich-zvyseni-jednala-vlada\"></a> , who and where has the savings to find the money for the announced increases, because the state budget deficit has already been announced at <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819351-novy-rozpocet-bude-mit-schodek-40-miliard-sektorova-dan-nebude-banky-ale-maji\">CZK 40 billion</a> and it should not have been exceeded.</p><p> There was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819144-rodicovska-na-programu-vlady-malacova-prichazi-s-kompromisem-potrebuje-osm-miliard\">an option</a> to divide the increase in the allowance: in the first half of 2019 there would be an increase of CZK 40,000, and by the end of the election period there would then be a planned full increase of another CZK 40,000. However, MP Maxová supported the option of a one-time increase: &quot; <em>I personally would probably prefer the option that children whose parents receive parental allowance receive it, and spread the 80,000 according to the length of time they have been drawing parental allowance.&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/pretahovani-o-rodicovskou-kdo-to-mysli-s-rodinami-lepe-malacova-nebo-babis-69733\">Duel Seznam Zprávy</a> , time 1:40)</p><p> The bill was finally submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/ALBSBCDM5SWO\">a second version</a> (.doc, page 8) with a one-time increase of CZK 80,000 and passed <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=490\">its second reading</a> in the Chamber of Deputies in September.</p><p> For the sake of completeness, let us add that MP Maxová was the chairwoman of the Social Policy Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic, but her <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2863985-zive-snemovna-resi-zvyseni-rodicovskeho-prispevku-i-oteviraci-dobu-obchodu\">mandate as a member of parliament expired</a> in July because she became an MEP, and she therefore no longer participated <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=70821\">in the vote</a> on the amendment to the law.</p>\nSECTION B: <p><a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-intergroup-european-parliament\">The Disability Intergroup</a> is an informal group of Members of the European Parliament interested in supporting people with disabilities and their rights. This “intergroup” is one of the oldest, first established in 1980.</p><p> After the last elections to the European Parliament, an initiative was taken <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/newsroom/news/european-disability-movement-calls-reestablishment-disability-intergroup-european\">to revive</a> this group in the new composition of the Parliament. The exact sequence of events and negotiations between the EU Disability Forum (EDF, an umbrella organization that helps people with disabilities) and the MEPs is not available, but Radka Maxová, who attended the negotiations and supports the establishment of the group, can also be considered the initiator of the establishment of the Disability Intergroup in the European Parliament.</p><p> If Maxová is talking in her statement about the MPs she managed to recruit for this group, or about the date of the group&#39;s establishment, then we were unable to verify these parts of the statement from public sources. Information about the negotiations on the group is only provided by posts on the social networks of MEP Maxová and EDF. Only the following two posts mention the creation of the aforementioned Disability Intergroup: </p><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fradka.maxova.1%2Fposts%2F2417964951767893&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"584\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FEuropeanDisabilityForumEDF%2Fposts%2F2545439382145973&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"830\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div><p> The contributions prove the meetings of MEPs (including Maxová) with EDF, the content of which is the planned creation of the Disability Intergroup.</p><p> Information on the current number of signatures and representation of all committees is not publicly available anywhere. The group&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-intergroup-european-parliament\">website</a> only provides <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/sites/default/files/disability_intergroup-mep_support_form_0.pdf\">a form</a> (.pdf) for MEPs to express their support for the group&#39;s establishment for the years 2019–2024. The same website also provides <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/sites/default/files/disability_intergroup_meps_list_-_update_october_2018.xls\">a list</a> (.xls) of the group&#39;s supporters, but this is for the previous period (2014–2019), not the one currently being negotiated.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>On September 17, 2019, an interview with Radka Maxová was published on the website <a href=\"https://denikn.cz/198131/na-socialni-sluzby-penize-nejsou-ale-nasla-se-miliarda-na-kurovce-rika-maxova-v-ano-zustava-kvuli-pracovitym-lidem/\">denikn.cz</a> , where she was asked, among other things, about her opinion on the suspension of the prosecution of Andrej Babiš. We were unable to find any other media outlets discussing this topic with MEP Maxová.</p><p> The <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/OJ-9-2019-09-16-SYN_CS.html\">Strasbourg</a> meeting took place from 16 to 19 September, and on none of the days was there any topic related to Andrej Babiš on the agenda. As for the <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/EMPL-PV-2019-09-24-1_EN.pdf\">Brussels</a> meeting, on 24 September there was a meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which Radka Maxová probably has in mind. The minutes also do not mention the discussion of the topic of Prime Minister Babiš and the suspension of his criminal prosecution.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Representatives of the ANO movement are part of the Renew Europe (formerly ALDE) faction in the European Parliament. No internal communication regarding the European Parliament resolution on the conflict of interest of Andrej Babiš has been published. In general, the Renew Europe faction has not commented on this topic on its <a href=\"https://reneweuropegroup.eu/en/news/\">website</a> , <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RenewEurope/\">social networks</a> or otherwise. Of the total number of <a href=\"https://reneweuropegroup.eu/en/about-us/our-meps/\">98</a> MEPs in this faction, 72 MEPs voted for the entire resolution ( <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/PV-9-2020-06-19-RCV_FR.pdf\">.pdf, p. 316</a> ).</p><p> Only the statement of MEP and member of this faction Radka Maxová is available. In an interview with Seznam Zprávy, she <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/babisova-europoslankyne-resim-jestli-setrvani-v-ano-je-pro-me-jeste-unosne-109740\">stated</a> that she did not agree with voting on the resolution as a whole, and that it would be appropriate to vote on certain parts ( <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2020-0164_CS.html\">part A and paragraphs 11, 14, 20, 21, 49</a> ) separately.</p><p> Whether there were discussions within the faction about whether it would be appropriate to vote on certain parts separately and whether the faction supported this proposal cannot be verified due to the lack of sources. However, in the end it was indeed <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/cs/press-room/20200615IPR81227/parlament-zada-vysetreni-mozneho-stretu-zajmu-ceskeho-premiera\">a resolution</a> as a whole.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The proposal to increase parental allowance <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=490\">passed</a> its second reading in the Chamber of Deputies on 25 September 2019. It is intended <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=161461\">to increase</a> (.pdf, p. 2, point 4) parental allowance by 80 thousand, from 220 thousand to 300 thousand crowns. In addition, the European Parliament Directive on work-life balance for parents and carers <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158\">was passed</a> on 20 June 2019. This directive is to be implemented by 2 August 2022 in all Member States (Article 20) and, for example, extends the length of paternity leave to 10 days, which is an extension of <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/otcovska-dovolena-se-prodlouzi-na-deset-dnu/r~03b973acb82f11e9b16b0cc47ab5f122/\">three</a> days.</p><p> As for the change in maternity leave, MEP Maxová probably means the changes described in Article 5 of this <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158\">directive</a> . According to it, each parent is entitled to 4 months of parental leave. Two of these months are non-transferable and, according to Article 8, also paid. According to the directive, parental leave can also be conditioned by the total time worked or the duration of the employment relationship. However, this period may not exceed 1 year.</p><p> In response to this directive and the increase in parental allowance, Radka Maxová has already expressed herself in the past and even then demanded a systemic <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/radka-maxova-rodice-volaji-hlavne-po-moznostech-skloubeni-pracovniho-a-rodinneho-7801534\">change</a> (video 10:40): &quot; <em>We wanted Minister Maláčová to say that if we were going to add this amount, then there needed to be a systemic change in the support for families from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. And that maybe we could talk about, could talk about, postponing the increase. So that it would be combined with work and private life, with the financing of children&#39;s groups, actually with the relationship to the directive that will be approved by the European Parliament</em> .&quot;</p><p> However, there has been no systemic change, i.e. a comprehensive amendment that would comprehensively regulate the individual institutions supporting working parents, including, for example, in connection with the aforementioned European directive. Individual areas are therefore amended separately, within separate amendments.</p><p> In addition to the amount of parental allowance, adjustments are also expected for children&#39;s groups. Children&#39;s groups <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/deti-jesle-platit-skupiny-prispevky.A190522_093831_domaci_elz\">are</a> places where children can be placed before starting kindergarten. There are currently 959 of these places in the Czech Republic with a capacity of over 14 thousand children. However, these children&#39;s groups are paid for from European funds, which will end after 2020 (groups that have applied for this will be funded until 2022).</p><p> The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs wants children&#39;s groups to be paid for from the state budget from <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2931710-jesle-se-vraci-malacova-chce-prejmenovat-detske-skupiny-a-hradit-je-z-rozpoctu\">2021</a> .</p><p> With the support of workers, one can also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske\">imagine</a> the emergence of part-time work. In the European Union, the Czech Republic <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-66249480-zapad-eu-valcuje-vychodni-zeme-bloku-v-podilu-lidi-pracujicich-na-zkraceny-uvazek-cesko-je-ve-srovnani-mezi-poslednimi\">is</a> among the countries with a lower popularity of part-time work. The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/jana-malacova-mpsv-castecny-uvazek-novela-zakonik-prace_1907161848_per\">expressed</a> a positive opinion on part-time work and stated that she is preparing an amendment to the Labor Code, which would include, among other things, the establishment of a shared job, which should support part-time work so that people can more easily have, for example, a twenty-hour workday.</p><p> VAT on home childcare services is also to <a href=\"https://www.finance.cz/527687-nizsi-dph-u-piva-holicky/\">be reduced</a> , which is another item that Radka Maxová <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske\">mentioned</a> in the context of increasing the parental allowance. However, the VAT reduction <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2019/novela-zakona-o-evidenci-trzeb-miri-do-t-34995\">does not</a> include tax on children&#39;s needs.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because all the above-mentioned changes were not linked together. This procedure can therefore be described as non-systematic, given that the individual amendments are being prepared gradually and independently of each other. The situation will also be affected by the European Parliament directive, which is to be implemented by August 2022, children&#39;s groups will then be funded by the state possibly from 2021, but the so-called micro-nurseries ( <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2741900-na-mikrojeslich-si-rodice-oblibili-hlavne-osobnejsi-pristup-k-detem-vznikaji-i-v\">nurseries with</a> a maximum of four children) have still not been resolved. The VAT reduction for home childcare services is then prepared, but the tax reduction for children&#39;s needs has not yet been adopted at all.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>A police <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/brno-policie-zasah-urad_1903070859_pj\">raid</a> by the National Headquarters against Organized Crime (NCOZ) took place at the Brno-Střed city hall on March 7, 2019. In connection with this raid, nine people were immediately <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/brno-stred-zasah-razie-policie-obvineni-ano_1903080614_ako\">charged</a> , led by Jiří Švachula (ANO movement), the former deputy mayor of this city district. This case, now known as Stoka, is said to involve the misuse of public contracts for bribes. A more detailed insight into the case is provided by <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1142743803-reporteri-ct/219452801240016/\">Reportéři ČT</a> (broadcast on May 6, 2019) in the first part of the program (time 1:02 to 17:40), where they talk about the creation of a corruption system in which the city hall management manipulates the awarding of public contracts for apartment repairs in favor of certain construction companies, who in return pay them 10% of the contract value in cash. The total amount of contracts affected in this way is supposed to have reached 180 million crowns. In order for the town hall to tailor the contract to a specific company, the Brno-střed town hall was to use one specific company, which purposefully prepared the tender conditions in such a way that a specific construction company would win. For the tender conditions prepared in this way, the company was to receive 2% of the total volume of the contract. The Stoka case is still the subject of a police investigation, the information provided by the ČT Reportéři program is drawn from individual resolutions on charges and from certain witnesses. As of July 8 of this year, according to the Aktuálně.cz server, a total of 37 people and one company had already <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/kauza-stoka-se-rozleva-dale-policie-obvinila-z-korupce-dalsi/r~081076dac10c11eab115ac1f6b220ee8/\">been charged</a> in the Stoka case.</p><p> In connection with this case and other possible corruption scandals or the connection of certain ANO members to &quot;questionable groups&quot;, the Brno presidium of ANO, headed by Petr Vokřál, <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/brno/zpravy/predsednictvo-ano-brnenske-organizace-zruseni-zidenice-cernovice-stary-liskovec.A200305_191413_brno-zpravy_zuf\">dissolved</a> the Brno cells in Židenice, Černovice and Starý Lískovec on March 5, 2020. In connection with the dissolution of these local organizations, the membership of 37 members was terminated. In May, the presidium of the ANO movement (the nationwide leadership of ANO) reversed this decision to dissolve the Brno organizations and decided to <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ano-jedna-o-zrusenych-brnenskych-bunkach-i-clenstvi-faltynka-jr-40324100\">resume</a> their activities. The reason given was that the dissolution was not carried out procedurally correctly and that the blanket dissolution of membership for all 37 members was too radical a solution. At the same time as this revocation of the Brno resolution on dissolution, the membership of Jiří Faltýnek (son of Jaroslav Faltýnek) in the ANO movement was <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ano-jedna-o-zrusenych-brnenskych-bunkach-i-clenstvi-faltynka-jr-40324100\">suspended</a> . Jiří Faltýnek is often associated in the media with the corruption case in Brno-střed. However, he has not yet been charged.</p><p> At the beginning of June, Petr Vokřál, the vice-chairman of the ANO movement, former mayor and candidate for governor of the South Moravian Region, <a href=\"https://www.lidovky.cz/domov/mistopredseda-ano-petr-vokral-ve-strane-konci-oduvodnil-to-udajnym-napojenim-brnenske-bunky-na-podsv.A200601_184743_ln_domov_ele?zdroj=vybava_recombee\">announced</a> that he was leaving the movement. The reason was that <i>he “no longer wants to associate his name with people who use the ANO movement only for their own personal gain and who thus destroy the good work of colleagues who have already managed to do a lot of good work.”</i> Petr Vokřál was one of the initiators of the dissolution of the three Brno cells mentioned above. Two weeks after Petr Vokřál’s resignation, the leadership of the ANO movement decided to <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/brno-zruseni-organizace-hnuti-ano-predsednictvo_2006161352_cen\">dissolve</a> the entire Brno organization.</p><p> The police raid in March 2019 was a kind of media trigger for the investigation of corruption in Brno by politicians of the ANO movement. Only then do we learn from individual articles that this corrupt behavior can be dated back to 2016. For example, investigative journalist Janek Kroupa talks about this in an article for <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/brno-korupce-jiri-svachula-podnikatele-faltynek_1903082045_jak\">iRozhlas</a> , in which he criticizes the lax approach of the police, who allegedly had evidence of corruption from wiretapping for three years. He wrote about this in more detail in the autumn of 2018 for the magazine <a href=\"https://reportermagazin.cz/a/irEbn/brnenske-ano-akdo-ridi-politiky-my\">Reportér.</a></p><p> Signals of corruption before the police raid, as mentioned above, are therefore traceable. The police raid took place in March 2019, so approximately one and a quarter years have actually passed since it. The closure of the three Brno organizations took place at the beginning of March of this year. Radka Maxová thus made an inaccuracy when she confused March with February. However, we assess this inaccuracy as minor and therefore assess the entire statement as true.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
