It follows from Mr. Vokřál&#39;s latest interviews that he also wanted to dissolve after the 3 organizations were not actually dissolved, so he wanted to dissolve the whole of Brno, then I don&#39;t know what happened in the leadership that they didn&#39;t actually dissolve the 3 organizations, the resolution was revoked and it&#39;s not that Mr. Andrej Babiš said he would dissolve it, but Petr Vokřál... proposed it and of course it happened.
