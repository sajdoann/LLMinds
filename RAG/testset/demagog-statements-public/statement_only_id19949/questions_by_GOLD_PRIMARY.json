    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Afghanistan borders six countries: China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.</p><p> If we consider the Czech Republic to be a Western-style democracy where human rights are respected and the country is secular, then none of these countries really come close to it in this regard.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.businessinfo.cz/cs/clanky/iran-zakladni-charakteristika-teritoria-ekonomicky-19380.html#sec1\">Iran</a> and <a href=\"http://www.businessinfo.cz/cs/clanky/pakistan-zakladni-charakteristika-teritoria-18742.html\">Pakistan</a> are countries where Islam is the state religion.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.businessinfo.cz/cs/clanky/tadzikistan-zakladni-charakteristika-teritoria-19451.html#sec1\">Tajikistan</a> , <a href=\"http://www.businessinfo.cz/cs/clanky/turkmenistan-zakladni-charakteristika-teritoria-19472.html#sec1\">Turkmenistan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uz.html\">Uzbekistan</a> are presidential republics, which nevertheless operate under a more or less authoritarian regime.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html\">China</a> is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and is constantly <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.cz/cina\">criticized</a> for, among other things, human rights violations.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>The first information about the order for 1.1 million respirators and 5 million masks from China appeared on March 15 on Jan Hamáček&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhamacek/status/1239161035816415233\">Twitter account</a> .</p><p> According to <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/ministerstvo-zdravotnictvi-neumelo-rousky-objednat-pomohl-ty/r~d5fe94d8689111ea9c800cc47ab5f122/\">Aktuálně.cz</a> , this was supposed to happen after Prime Minister Andrej Babiš entrusted the Ministry of the Interior with the purchase of respirators and masks. This is allowed by Act <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-240#p4-1-b\">No. 240/2000 Coll.</a> The reason was the inability of the Ministry of Health to order this equipment.</p><p> <i>&quot;So we have a fast payment system and I can tell you that we now have more than 30 million masks, 6 million respirators, 250,000 protective biosuits for doctors and medical staff, and 250,000 glasses and shields paid for and under contract in China. This is something that should fundamentally change the situation.&quot;</i> This was the statement of the Minister of the Interior on March 17 at <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-po-mimoradnem-jednani-vlady--17--brezna-2020-180412/\">a press conference</a> after an extraordinary government meeting. According to this statement, the number of equipment ordered from China has increased.</p><p> So far, the latest information with a higher number of protective equipment was heard on March 22 in <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/220411030500322/\">Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions</a> (time 26:25).

The only difference here is the number of protective suits, where Info.cz states the number of 300,000, instead of the 250,000 announced by Jan Hamáček.</p><p> Information about the contract for face masks, FFP2 respirators, goggles, protective shields, or disposable tests is not searchable in <a href=\"https://smlouvy.gov.cz\">the contract register</a> .</p>\nSECTION C: <p>From the beginning, <a href=\"https://denikn.cz/minuta/322666/\">the distribution system</a> , in which the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of the Interior were responsible for distribution separately, was criticized primarily by <a href=\"http://www.asociacekraju.cz/novinky/hejtmani-ministerstvo-zdravotnictvi-nezvlada-situaci-ohledne-zasobovani-ochrannymi-prostredky-museli-jsme-system-resit-sami-1.html\">regional governors</a> , healthcare facilities, and <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/zasobovani-podle-hejtmanu-selhava-premier-vojtecha-odvolat-nechce/1869610\">the Minister of the Interior,</a> Jan Hamáček.

The Prime Minister fully accepted the commission’s conclusions.</p><p> Given the above, we consider the statement to be true, even though there were actually 12 applicants for the position, unlike the 14 mentioned.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>Whether the hospital bed capacity has already been &quot;drastically increased&quot; is a bit questionable. According to data published by <a href=\"https://www.hlidacstatu.cz/kapacitanemocnic#CR\">the State Watch</a> , the total number of beds, for example, decreased slightly from October 10 to October 18. However, if we compare the data from the beginning of October to the day of the interview, it cannot be denied that there was a certain increase during this period. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" title=\"Number of ARO + ICU beds and standard beds with oxygen intended for patients infected with coronavirus\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-lK6rQ\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lK6rQ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"876\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();</script></figure><p> It is also true that hospitals are currently limiting <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3200727-cast-tuzemskych-nemocnic-zacina-omezovat-neakutni-peci-ta-urgentni-ale-funguje-dal\">non-acute care</a> , freeing up space for the expected increase in patients with Covid-19. At the same time, the state plans to use beds from state material <a href=\"https://www.denik.cz/z_domova/hamacek-kapacity-nemocnice-luzka-20201012.html\">reserves</a> , some of them for a new facility <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/koronavirus-nemocnice-luzka-kapacita-babis.A201015_080242_domaci_jech\">in Letňany</a> , which the Central Crisis Staff is building with the help <a href=\"http://www.acr.army.cz/informacni-servis/zpravodajstvi/armada-ma-zalozni-nemocnici-v-letnanech-ze-dvou-tretin-hotovou-224170/\">of the Czech Army</a> .

First, due to the covid-19 infection, but also due to government measures, as reported by, for example, <a href=\"https://www.fnbrno.cz/nedostatek-zdravotnich-sester-se-po-novych-vladnich-opatrenich-prohlubuje/t6984\">the Brno University Hospital</a> .
