Let&#39;s remember March, April, when Italy and Spain called for help. I remember how the Spanish Hercules arrived, which we loaded with protective suits, material aid was sent to Italy, North Macedonia received a million masks from us, we lent material to Slovenia, we helped the Slovaks build an air bridge.
