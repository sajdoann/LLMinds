If I appoint him as Prime Minister, he will form a government, go to the Chamber of Deputies with that government and ask for confidence. If he does not receive that confidence, the President has one more chance to appoint the Prime Minister, it could be the same one, it could be the second one on the list, and so on, and according to the Constitution, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies then has a third chance.
