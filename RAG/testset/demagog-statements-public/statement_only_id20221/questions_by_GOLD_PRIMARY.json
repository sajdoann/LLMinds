    "Please answer TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWABLE about the text's veracity. In addition write a short summary explaining your answer. If the veracity cannot be determined answer UNKNOWABLE. The first sentence in the response should be TRUE. FALSE. or UNKNOWABLE. eg:UNKNOWABLE.",
    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Vít Rakušan talks about the resolution in connection with <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/babisuv-odhalil-ze-si-tiskne-vladni-maily-ve-firme-ze-sverenskych-fondu-98372\">the case of</a> Prime Minister Babiš from the beginning of April. During his regular <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2SwQpWtZTQE?t=332\">weekend report</a> (video) on his YouTube channel, Andrej Babiš read information about the financing of the health sector from a piece of paper on which an e-mail addressed to the Prime Minister from the Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, was printed on the other side. Minister Vojtěch sent the message to the Prime Minister&#39;s private e-mail address, who then forwarded it to an employee of the IMOBA company, who printed it for him.</p><p> <a href=\"https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vysledky?subjektId=713630&amp;typ=PLATNY\">IMOBA</a> is a member of the SynBiol concern, which is part of Andrej Babiš&#39;s <a href=\"https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66371830-kdo-je-kdo-ve-sverenskych-fondech-pres-ktere-podle-expertu-babis-dal-ovlada-agrofert-dulezite-funkce-maji-premierovi-pravnici-i-manzelka\">trust fund</a> called AB private trust I. The video also shows that Prime Minister Babiš uses his personal address with the domain &quot;e-babis.cz&quot; for government email communication. In response to the video, a wave of criticism arose, firstly, regarding the Prime Minister&#39;s continuing ties to his former trust companies and secondly, due to the way the Prime Minister operates with potentially sensitive government information on unsecured email addresses.</p><p> The 37th meeting of the House Committee on Security took place on May 14. According to its <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173747&amp;pdf=1\">invitation</a> (.pdf), the deputies were to discuss the 5th item <i>&quot;Securing government materials when using private e-mail addresses by the Prime Minister and members of the government&quot;.</i> This item was proposed by Vít Rakušan, and the head of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security Karel Řehka was also invited to comment. It is true that due to time constraints, this item <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-e-maily-soukroma-posta-imoba-bezpecnostni-vybor-poslanci-snemovna_2005190600_kno\">was not</a> discussed and was postponed to the next meeting of the House of Representatives, which is scheduled to take place at the end of May.</p><p> This particular meeting of the Security Committee was not public according to <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173747&amp;pdf=1\">the invitation</a> and no <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4905&amp;ido=1311&amp;kk=4&amp;td=3&amp;n=2\">minutes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4905&amp;ido=1311&amp;kk=5&amp;td=1&amp;n=9\">resolutions</a> have been made available yet. Therefore, we cannot verify whether the draft resolution that Vít Rakušan mentions actually contained information regarding the methodology of internet communication of government members.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>&quot; <i>I am ready to support a resolution that clearly states that the Chamber of Deputies values the role of the legionnaires in the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic,&quot;</i> Jan Hamáček said on May 17 in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions ( <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/220411030500517/\">video</a> , time 17:28). Further in the discussion, Jan Hamáček emphasized that it is necessary to clearly state what the role of our legionnaires was in the past.</p><p> This statement corresponds to part of the draft resolution of the Chamber of Deputies, which was presented on May 18 by the chairman of the STAN movement, Vít Rakušan. The last point of this proposal <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/info-a-media/tiskove-zpravy/rakusan-snemovna-by-mela-odvolat-soudruha-filipa-z-vedeni-a-distancovat-se-od-jeho-slov\">states</a> that the Chamber of Deputies &quot; <i>respects the struggle of the Czechoslovak legionnaires during the First World War, who with their courage and determination fundamentally contributed to the establishment of an independent, free and democratic Czechoslovakia</i> .&quot;</p>\nSECTION C: <p>The Pirates and the STAN movement <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/Pirati-a-STAN-predstavili-navrh-koalicni-smlouvy.html\">presented</a> the coalition <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/fmfile/0/files/2020%20hlavn%C3%AD%20STAN/koalicni-smlouva-pirati-a-starostove.pdf\">agreement</a> (.pdf) on December 22, 2020 and submitted it to their members for a vote. The STAN national committee <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/info-a-media/tiskove-zpravy/celostatni-vybor-hnuti-stan-schvalil-koalicni-smlouvu-s-piraty\">approved</a> the agreement on January 7, and the Pirates approved it at their national online forum <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/79-procent-piratu-odsouhlasila-koalici-se-stan.html\">on January 12,</a> 2021.</p><p> The coalition <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/fmfile/0/files/2020%20hlavn%C3%AD%20STAN/koalicni-smlouva-pirati-a-starostove.pdf\">agreement</a> (.pdf, Appendix No. 2, page 2) states regarding the coalition council:</p><p> <i>&quot;2.1. The highest body of the coalition is <strong>the coalition council</strong> , which meets in the format of 2 to 5 members in equal numbers for each coalition party (…).&quot;</i></p><p> The scope of the coalition council&#39;s activities is then listed in point 2.3. (ibid., pp. 2–3).<i> </i>For example, the council will approve the coalition&#39;s program, be responsible for fulfilling legal obligations (p. 6), create a joint post-election negotiation team (p. 7), or approve rules regarding the management of joint property (ibid., Appendix No. 4, p. 3).</p><p> As for disputes, point no. 12 (ibid., Appendix no. 2, p. 8) regarding their resolution states as follows:</p><p> <i>&quot;12.1. If a dispute arises between the parties to this contract regarding the performance, interpretation or alleged breach of this contract or its threat, the parties undertake to resolve it amicably, by personal negotiations between the interested parties or by negotiations with a mediator whom both parties trust, or by referral to a higher level within the coalition, or to the national leaders of the coalition parties, and to make all necessary efforts to reach an agreement and resolve the matter amicably.&quot;</i></p><p> <i>&quot;12.2. If the dispute cannot be resolved by agreement or negotiation, either party has the right to initiate conciliation proceedings, based on a written proposal to <strong>the coalition council. Three representatives of each contracting party participate in the conciliation proceedings</strong> .&quot;</i></p><p> Disputes between the parties of the coalition are therefore resolved in various ways. However, it is true that significant disputes can be resolved by the coalition council as the highest body. At the same time, it is true that, for example, in the area of programs or post-election negotiations, the coalition council is the key decision-making body, which is thus superior to party bodies.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Vít Rakušan <a href=\"https://www.vitrakusan.cz/zivotopis/\">studied</a> history, German studies, and school management. He then <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2786660-z-ucitele-nemciny-hvezdou-komunalni-politiky-rakusan-zacal-karieru-jako-nestranik\">taught</a> German at a grammar school in Kutná Hora.</p><p> The Russian Liberation Army (ROA), known as the Vlasovs, <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/exhibit/rukavovy-znak-jednotek-ruske-osvobozenecke-armady-vlasovcu/\">was formed</a> in November 1944. This happened after General Vlasov <a href=\"https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach\">was captured</a> by the Germans during the defense of Leningrad. The ROA <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/veda-technologie/historie/ustr-historik-historie-osvobozeni-cesko-rusko-vlasovci_1912141111_hag\">members</a> included Soviet prisoners of war and the so-called white emigration, or people who left the USSR in the 1920s and decided to fight against Stalin. Their main <a href=\"https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach\">goal</a> was to defeat Stalin. Germany was to help them achieve these goals. On the side of Nazi Germany, <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">they fought</a> against the USSR in the area between the Oder and the Neisse.</p><p> However, in the spring of 1945, it became <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">clear</a> to Vlasov (audio, time from 15:30) that he could not count on Germany&#39;s help in the long-term fight against Stalin. On the contrary, the Germans were rather using Vlasov&#39;s army for their own purposes. For this reason, he decided to leave Germany with his army for Linz. In an attempt to win the favor of the Allied (or American) troops, he then decided, together with General Bunyachenko, to help liberate Prague.</p><p> <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/zradci-a-vrazi-nebo-zneuznani-osvoboditele-diskuze-o-vyznamu-kontroverznich-8121440\">They arrived</a> in Prague on May 5, 1945. They fought mainly on the southern bank and their greatest success was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2989820-vlasovci-necekane-pomohli-pri-prazskem-povstani-predtim-bojovali-s-hitlerem-proti\">the capture</a> of Ruzyně. German planes took off from there to bomb Prague. Around 300 Vlasov soldiers <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2989820-vlasovci-necekane-pomohli-pri-prazskem-povstani-predtim-bojovali-s-hitlerem-proti\">died</a> in these battles.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>First of all, let us state that Jan Hamáček responds to this statement by Vít Rakušan with another <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/19933\">statement</a> . Both statements concern similar matters and at first glance, the two statements may be mutually exclusive. However, the factual statements contained in the statements are different; here we focused on whether (all) preparatory steps based on Pavel Řehák&#39;s recommendations were carried out over the summer.</p><p> Vít Rakušan talks here about <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/muze-s-tabulkou-uz-podruhe-neposlechli-pak-cesko-zaskocila-druha-vlna-125528\">Pavel Řehák&#39;s</a> team, which at the end of May 2020 created <a href=\"https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY\">a document</a> (.pdf) entitled &quot;Rapid Response System for a Possible Second Wave of the Covid-19 Epidemic and Other Epidemics&quot;. This material recommends 32 specific steps that need to be taken to minimize the impact of the next wave of Covid-19 on the health of the population and the economy. Let us add that Pavel Řehák <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/muze-s-tabulkou-uz-podruhe-neposlechli-pak-cesko-zaskocila-druha-vlna-125528\">sent</a> the aforementioned document to Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and other ministers on May 26.</p><p> In short, the material calls for rapid data evaluation, a rapid response in the implementation of epidemiological measures, and a massive increase in testing capacities, or rather, ensuring a system that will then be able to handle a large number of tests. It also calls for the creation of a central call center, which will allow for a multiple increase in the capacities of regional hygiene stations and enable effective tracing of the infected even with higher numbers of infected people.</p><p> This advisory document also points out that the current Pandemic Plan of the Czech Republic ( <a href=\"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/wepub/5520/14546/Pandemick%C3%BD%20pl%C3%A1n%20%C4%8CR.pdf\">.pdf</a> ) was created for an influenza <a href=\"https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY\">epidemic</a> (.pdf, p. 13) and needs to be updated, through the Central Epidemiological Commission (.pdf, p. 7 et seq.).</p><p> The Central Epidemiological Commission did not really meet &quot;in the summer months&quot;, as Vít Rakušan states in his statement. Its meetings were held in <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/o-koronaviru-bude-dnes-jednat-ustredni-epidemiologicka-komise-vojtech-zdravotnictvi.A200227_085552_domaci_lre\">February</a> , <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/cisla-rostla-ministr-vojtech-dal-klicove-komisi-ctyri-mesice-prazdnin-119731\">March</a> and April. It then met on May 15, but the next meeting did not take place until <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/ustredni-epidemiologicka-komise-bude-jednat-o-covidu-19/1932645\">September 17, 2020.</a> The fact that the Central Epidemiological Commission did not meet in the summer was even described as a mistake by Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/babis-byla-chyba-ze-se-epidemiologicka-komise-v-lete-nesesla/1934219\">Andrej Babiš</a> .</p><p> Among other recommendations that Pavel Řehák&#39;s material contained and that did not &quot;run&quot; during the summer months, one can select, for example, the aforementioned establishment of a central call center for tracing contacts of infected people ( <a href=\"https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY\">.pdf</a> , p. 8). On September 14, 2020, the then Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/hygienikum-ma-ulehcit-call-centrum-mozna-nekdy-na-podzim-planuje-vojtech-119777\">stated</a> that its creation would take place <i>&quot;during the autumn&quot;</i> . Let us add that regional hygiene stations began to have problems with <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/napor-na-hygieny-sili-ktere-kraje-nestihaji-trasovat-121213\">tracking</a> in the second half of August. With the situation worsening, in October, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/hygiena-trasovani-firmy-vyzva-call-centra-trasovani_2010111124_tzr\">called on</a> Czech companies to have their call center employees help regional hygiene stations with tracing.</p><p> Another recommendation that the government did not implement in the summer months is to ensure higher <a href=\"https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY\">testing capacities</a> (.pdf, pages 20 and 21). The Czech Republic only reached the recommended numbers of 30–50 thousand tests per day almost in <a href=\"https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19\">mid-</a> October.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>The meeting of the House Committee on Security described in the statement, at which the &quot;information of the Director of the Security Information Service (BIS) on some articles published in the previous two weeks in the online edition of the Respekt periodical&quot; was <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173469\">discussed</a> ( <i>.doc)</i> , took place on May 6, 2020 and was <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4916&amp;dx=20200506\">not public</a> .</p><p> The meeting took place in response to <a href=\"https://www.respekt.cz/tydenik/2020/18/muz-s-ricinem\">an article</a> in the weekly magazine Respekt, in which Ondřej Kundra described the arrival of a man from Russia with a diplomatic passport who had ricin (a poison) in his briefcase. He also stated that security forces were aware of the traveler&#39;s arrival and assessed the man as an immediate risk to a pair of Czech politicians whose actions in recent months had drawn the ire of Moscow. These politicians were said to be Ondřej Kolář and Zdeněk Hřib. Ondřej Kundra supported this information with unspecified Respekt sources.</p><p> According to sources from the Czech Press Office, the Security Committee <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/reakce-bezpecnostnich-slozek-v-kauze-ricin-byla-podle-vyboru-adekvatni/1887589\">found</a> the response of the Czech security forces to be adequate. Concerns about the safety of Prague politicians are also confirmed <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3085706-starosta-prahy-6-kolar-se-kvuli-vyhruzkam-skryva-na-neznamem-miste-ochranu-maji-i\">by the assignment of</a> police protection to the two aforementioned politicians and the mayor of Řeporyjí, Pavel Novotný. </p><iframe style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden;\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftydenikrespekt%2Fposts%2F10158436442776103&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=330&amp;appId\" width=\"552\" height=\"330\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p> Due to non-publicity, it is not possible to verify the votes of individual council members, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4901\">including</a> members of the SPD and KSČM, as Vít Rakušan correctly states in his statement.</p><p> The political parties <a href=\"https://www.spd.cz/novinky/6783-tomio-okamura-bezpecnostni-informacni-sluzba-bis-vyplodila-dalsi-nesmysl\">SPD</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kscm.cz/cs/aktualne/medialni-vystupy/komentare/m-semelova-komu-slouzi-bis\">KSČM</a> are, in line with the statement, frequent critics of the BIS. </p><iframe style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftomio.cz%2Fposts%2F2969054843105311&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=701&amp;appId\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" width=\"552\" height=\"701\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><iframe style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftomio.cz%2Fposts%2F2407024652641669&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=571&amp;appId\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" width=\"552\" height=\"571\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><iframe style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkomunistickastranacechamoravy%2Fposts%2F1782236155252452&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=587&amp;appId\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" width=\"552\" height=\"587\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
