    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>In his statement, Andrej Babiš <a href=\"https://www.euroskop.cz/8917/sekce/zakladajici-smlouvy/\">uses</a> the old name of the currently valid Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Treaty of Lisbon changed the name of <a href=\"http://www.euroskop.cz/gallery/2/756-smlouva_o_es_nice.pdf\">the Treaty establishing the European Community</a> to the aforementioned <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN\">Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</a> In this case, this is only a minor error; moreover, Prime Minister Babiš correctly quotes Article 311, which is found in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU):</p><p> <i>&quot;</i> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN\"><i>Article 311</i></a></p><p> <i>The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to achieve its objectives and to successfully implement its policies.</i></p><p> <i>The budget is financed entirely from own resources; other revenues are not affected.</i></p><p> In accordance with the ruling, the European Union <a href=\"https://www.respekt.cz/agenda/prevratny-navrh-unie-si-chce-spolecne-pujcit-na-obnovu-ekonomiky-po-koronaviru\">has not previously borrowed</a> , because, in addition to the fact that, according to Article 311 TFEU, the Union manages only its own resources, according to <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN\">Article 125</a> TFEU, <i>&quot;The Union</i> <i>shall not be liable for or assume the obligations of central governments, regional or local authorities or other public bodies, other bodies governed by public law or public undertakings of any Member State, except in the case of mutual financial guarantees for the joint implementation of a specific project.&quot;</i> Furthermore, according to <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN\">Article 310 TFEU,</a> <i>&quot;the EU budget must be in balance in terms of revenue and expenditure.&quot;</i> These norms of EU primary law <a href=\"https://finmag.penize.cz/ekonomika/417060-unie-si-jde-pujcit-na-financni-trhy-my-nic-my-eu-to-nejaky-fond-z-bruselu\">prohibit</a> EU loans that would adversely affect a balanced EU budget, or a loan to secure the financing of Member States for which the EU is responsible (the EU does not assume the obligations of Member States).</p><p> The European Union as a whole cannot borrow for the time being. However, this does not apply to the European Investment Bank (EIB), which uses the loan to carry out its tasks. However, it is clear from the context of the statement that Andrej Babiš is talking about loans from the EU as a whole and not about the EIB, which has its own legal personality:</p><ul><li> <i>&quot;Article 308 TFEU</i><br> <i>The European Investment Bank shall have legal personality.&#39;</i><br></li><li> Protocol (No 5) to the TFEU on the Statute of the European Investment Bank<br> <i>&quot;</i> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A12016E%2FPRO%2F05\"><i>Article 20</i></a><br> <i>1. The Bank borrows the funds necessary to carry out its tasks on the capital market.</i><br> <i>2. The Bank may borrow on the capital markets of the Member States within the framework of the legal provisions governing those markets.</i><br> <i>The competent authorities of a Member State with a derogation within the meaning of Article 139(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union may refuse consent only if there is a risk of serious disturbances on the capital market of that State.’</i></li></ul><p> The European Commission is eligible to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-financial-assistance/eu-borrower_en\">borrow</a> on behalf of the EU from the capital markets to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/how-does-eu-finance-its-financial-assistance_en\">finance</a> loan programmes intended to provide assistance to countries in need. Loan programmes include balance of payments assistance, the European Stability Mechanism and financial assistance to non-EU countries. Assistance is <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/policies/financial-assistance-eurozone-members/\">provided</a> mainly because of the interconnectedness of the economies of the countries and therefore the potential negative impact of a dysfunctional economy of the affected country. In these cases, the Commission acts only as a kind of intermediary between the capital markets and the Member State, where these funds are not used to finance the operation of the Union, but are provided, again as a loan, to the Member State. In contrast, in the case of financing the Next Generation EU programme, the funds are to be used to finance the operation of the Union, or rather to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/about_the_european_commission/eu_budget/2020.2139_cs_04.pdf\">finance</a> subsidies to Member States.</p><p> For the reasons described above, we evaluate the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>At a press conference after the meeting of the Government Council for Health Risks on August 17, 2020, the then Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-po-zasedani-rady-vlady-pro-zdravotni-rizika--17--srpna-2020-183179/\">stated</a> that from September 1, the obligation to wear masks in public transport and in closed public spaces (with the exception of restaurants and, in the case of schools, in classrooms) would be reintroduced.</p><p> At the same conference, Minister of Education Robert Plaga <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-po-zasedani-rady-vlady-pro-zdravotni-rizika--17--srpna-2020-183179/\">announced</a> that a joint Manual of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education ( <a href=\"https://www.msmt.cz/file/53580_1_1/\">.pdf</a> ) was presented at the Council meeting, which concerns the operation of schools and school facilities in the 2020/2021 school year in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. This manual was subsequently intended for schools. It should be added that the document also contained references (.pdf, p. 5) to the so-called <a href=\"https://www.mzcr.cz/tiskove-centrum-mz/system-pohotovostnich-stupnu-nabidne-obcanum-predvidatelny-plan-protiepidemickych-opatreni-v-souvislosti-s-covid-19/\">traffic light</a> measures in individual districts, according to which schools were to follow.</p><p> On August 19, 2020, the Minister of Health Vojtěch and the Chief Hygienist Jarmila Rážová <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/rousky-budou-povinne-v-kadernictvich-i-u-voleb-zive/1923208\">spoke</a> at a press conference in the Chamber of Deputies regarding <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/skoly-skolstvi-zaci-rousky-koronavirus-opatreni-adam-vojtech.A200820_184410_domaci_wass\">the published</a> emergency measure ( <a href=\"https://www.cak.cz/assets/mimoradne-opatreni-noseni-ochrannych-prostredku-dychacich-cest-s-vyjimkami-s-ucinnosti-od-1-9-2020-do-odvolani.pdf\">.pdf</a> ) on the mandatory wearing of masks indoors, on public transport and in schools.</p><p> The government&#39;s actions regarding masks at the time were criticized by the head of the ODS, Petr Fiala. <i>&quot;3 weeks ago, Minister Vojtěch solemnly introduced a &#39;traffic light&#39; according to which the state would introduce new measures. Today, when the traffic light is white almost throughout the country, masks are being introduced again across the board, including restaurants and hairdressers. Doesn&#39;t that make sense to you? It doesn&#39;t matter. Nobody cares,&quot;</i> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/P_Fiala/status/1296088775873921027\">he wrote</a> on Twitter.</p><p> On August 20, the Minister of Health and epidemiologists met with Prime Minister Babiš. <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/v-narizenich-o-rouskach-je-chaos-babis-se-sejde-s-vojtechem-40333880\">The topic of</a> the meeting was the chaotic regulations on the wearing of masks, which Andrej Babiš had reservations about. After this meeting, Prime Minister Babiš later identified epidemiologist <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/premier-andrej-babis-rousky-koronavirus-vojtech-jermanova.A200821_200443_domaci_aug\">Rastislav Maďar</a> as the one who promoted the strict rules on the wearing of masks. Babiš repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koronavirus-babis-vojtech-rousky-opatreni-belorusko_2008212149_onz\">claimed</a> in media interviews that Vojtěch did not have good information, because each working group had a different opinion on the wearing of masks.</p><p> <i>&quot;Associate Professor Maďar wanted the area-wide measures to be implemented regardless of the traffic light. But we wanted the measures to be controlled by the traffic light and other data from the smart quarantine, because otherwise the traffic light is pointless,&quot;</i> <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/madar-dostal-pres-prsty-za-rouskovy-zmatek-bude-degradovan-116899\">said</a> Petr Šnajdárek, the architect of the smart quarantine, to Seznam Zprávám on August 20, who also attended the aforementioned meeting.</p><p> Some members of his team and other working groups also <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/madar-dostal-pres-prsty-za-rouskovy-zmatek-bude-degradovan-116899\">disagreed</a> with the form of the measures that Rastislav Maďar advocated and that were to come into effect on September 1. <i>&quot;A number of opinions were expressed at the meeting of our group that we do not agree with it being</i> <i>announced in this wording on Wednesday (August 19, note: Demagog.cz). I did not want masks to be mandatory in schools,&quot;</i> <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/madar-dostal-pres-prsty-za-rouskovy-zmatek-bude-degradovan-116899\">said,</a> for example, epidemiologist and member of Maďar&#39;s team Roman Chlíbek.</p><p> Immediately after, <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-konference/tiskova-konference-ministra-zdravotnictvi-k-mimoradnym-opatrenim--20--srpna-2020-183212/\">a relaxation of</a> the planned measures was announced at a press conference on August 20. According to the new rules, people were only supposed to wear them when there was a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in the region. <i>“We are actually able to react very promptly if there were any changes in the situation. (…) So we came to a certain conclusion regarding the modification of the extraordinary measure, but not its cancellation, rather better targeting where we currently perceive the greatest risk in terms of the spread of the disease,”</i> Adam Vojtěch explained at the time, justifying the change in decision.</p><p> On August 21, the Seznam Zprávy portal reported that Minister Vojtěch <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/mlcte-a-me-vynechte-po-rouskovem-debaklu-meni-vojtech-boj-s-covidem-116946\">had moved</a> all three working <a href=\"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/pracovni-a-poradni-skupiny/\">groups</a> dealing with the Covid-19 epidemic, i.e. the laboratory, clinical and epidemiological groups, to the so-called Integrated Central Management Team ( <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/ppov/rada_vlady_pro_zdravotni_rizika/integrovany_centralni_ridici_tym/uvodni-text-integrovany-centralni-ridici-tym-183148/\">ICŘT</a> ) of smart quarantine. It is headed by Chief Hygienist Jarmila Rážová. <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/mlcte-a-me-vynechte-po-rouskovem-debaklu-meni-vojtech-boj-s-covidem-116946\">The aim</a> of the establishment of the ICŘT was to improve coordination of working groups. The changes were to take effect from August 24.</p><p> On August 24, Adam Vojtěch also announced in <a href=\"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/od-1-zari-budou-povinne-rousky-ve-vybranych-vnitrnich-prostorech/\">a press release</a> from the Ministry of Health that from September 1, face masks will be mandatory in health and social service facilities, on public transport, in offices, in polling stations or in the case of indoor mass events of over 100 people. From September 1, relaxed measures were <a href=\"https://www.mzcr.cz/tiskove-centrum-mz/od-1-zari-budou-povinne-rousky-ve-vybranych-vnitrnich-prostorech/\">put into practice</a> - according to the new wording of the emergency measure ( <a href=\"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mimoradne-opatreni-noseni-ochrannych-prostredku-dychacich-cest-s-vyjimkami-s-ucinnosti-od-1-9-2020-do-odvolani.pdf\">.pdf</a> ), face masks were not mandatory in schools, shops, hairdressing services or sports facilities.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Vladimír Kremlík <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/vladimir-kremlik-173245/\">was</a> Minister of Transport from April 29, 2019 to January 23, 2020.</p><p> Former Minister Kremlík <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/nabidli-mi-uplatek-15-milionu-rekl-kremlik-babis-mlci-ale-bis-to-vi-88094\">allegedly</a> met with lawyer Martin Janoušek at the ministry&#39;s headquarters on December 20, 2019. Janoušek allegedly offered a bribe of 1.5 million crowns for CGI to retain oversight of the toll system.</p><p> 25 days later, specifically on January 14, Vladimír Kremlík was supposed to send a report to the director of the Security Information Service about the situation that had arisen. According to the Seznam news server, Vladimír Kremlík was supposed <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3043235-podivna-situace-kremlik-pry-jako-ministr-dostal-korupcni-nabidku-padla-uz-tri-trestni\">to file</a> a criminal complaint on Monday, February 3, 2020.</p><p> According to <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/kremlik-odvolani-uplatek-transparency-international-bis-policie_2002041632_aur\">the statement</a> of the Transparency International lawyer, the alleged criminal report was filed late. In the interview, it is said that, according to the interpretation of the law, a crime must be reported within a maximum of a few days. Similarly, the commentary to the Criminal Code (Šámal et al., CH Beck, 2012) states that <em>“reporting an act without delay means that a person who has reliably learned that one of the crimes listed in this provision has been committed takes the earliest opportunity to report it.”</em> In any case, <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2009-40#f3921514\">the law</a> itself, specifically in Section 368 of the Criminal Code, does not explicitly state the time within which a crime must be reported. However, from the interpretation of the provisions of the Criminal Code, it can be concluded that the former Minister Kremlík did indeed report the crime late.</p><p> As for the actual reporting of a crime, anyone can report a crime. They can do so orally, in writing, electronically or in another way. A crime can be <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2009-40#p368-1\">reported</a> to any police authority or to the public prosecutor&#39;s office. Let us therefore focus on whether former Minister Kremlík reported the crime to the relevant authority, or whether his SMS message to the Director of the BIS can be considered a report to a police authority. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1961-141#p12-2-f\">Section 12, paragraph 2, letter f)</a> of Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Code of Criminal Procedure, a police authority includes, among other things, the authorized bodies of the Security Information Service in proceedings concerning crimes committed by members of the Security Information Service. Since <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/inspekce/\">the BIS Inspectorate</a> , as a police authority, is directly subordinate to the Director of the BIS, it is valid that Vladimír Kremlík reported the crime to a police authority within the meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p><p> However, in order to evaluate the statement, it is important to clarify whether by the term “reported” Andrej Babiš means reporting a crime under the Criminal Code, or generally passing on information about a suspicion of committing a crime to a third party. Since Andrej Babiš did not use the word “report” as used in criminal law, we assume that by reporting he means a simple communication to another person, not necessarily to an authority involved in criminal proceedings and not necessarily within the time limit required by the Criminal Code. Since, according to the available information, the former Minister Kremlík should have reported his suspicions to the Director of the BIS, and indeed after about three weeks, as Andrej Babiš himself admitted, we evaluate the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Václav Havel delivered his <a href=\"https://www.vaclavhavel.cz/cs/vaclav-havel/dilo/projevy#yr1989\">third</a> New Year&#39;s presidential address on January 1, 1992, at Prague Castle. The speech began with the following <a href=\"http://www.darius.cz/ag_nikola/cl_havel_4.html\">words</a> : <em>&quot;Dear fellow citizens, I have been asking myself this fundamental question for some time now: why, at a time when no foreign power threatens us or interferes in our affairs, and we</em> - <em>as a state and as citizens</em> - <em>truly have our destiny in our own hands for the first time in centuries, do we have so few reasons for joyful satisfaction?&quot;</em><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\nSECTION E: <p>We interpret the term “our period” as the period when the ANO movement ruled in a minority cabinet after the elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the autumn of 2017. Taking into account a certain amount of time to form a government, we examined the changes in the Value Added Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Act”) from 1 January 2018. Since this period, VAT has been reduced under three amendments. These were Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll., Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">6/2019</a> Coll.</p><p> Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll. and Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> Coll. were government bills that introduced a reduction in VAT on a wide range of goods and services. What did not escape great media attention was the reduction in the rate on beer.</p><p> List of goods and services for which the VAT rate was reduced by Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501\">256/2019</a> Coll.:</p><ol><li> <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-256/zneni-20200501?text=%C2%A7%2047\">Electronic books</a></li><li> Catering services, serving drinks (VAT on beer is reduced under this item)</li><li> Interior cleaning services performed in households</li><li> Home care for children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled</li><li> Shoe and leather goods repair</li><li> Repairs and alterations of clothing and textile products</li><li> Bicycle repairs</li><li> Hairdressing and barber services</li></ol><p> As part of Amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=68877\">80/2019</a> Coll. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=104.\">, &quot;heat and cold</a> &quot; was moved from the first reduced rate (15%) to the second reduced rate (10%).</p><p> Since these were government amendments to the law, it is understandable that they were <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=70948\">supported</a> by the ANO movement. Deputies from the ČSSD and the KSČM, which supports the government, also <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=69368&amp;l=cz\">voted</a> for the proposals. In fact, not a single deputy was against the amendment No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-80?text=\">80/2019</a> .</p><p> The amendment to the VAT Act No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">6/2019</a> Coll. was adopted in the Chamber of Deputies as <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=140\">a parliamentary proposal</a> by deputies from the STAN movement. It also contains a reduced rate for regular land public passenger transport, which Andrej Babiš talks about in his statement. In the Chamber of Deputies, this amendment <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=68622&amp;l=cz\">was not supported</a> by the ANO movement and deputies from the ČSSD, the vast majority of whom abstained from voting.</p><p> Regular ground public passenger transport has therefore <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-6\">moved</a> from the first reduced rate (15%) to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-235?text=p%C5%99%C3%ADloha%20%C4%8D.%202a\">the second</a> reduced rate (10%). However, carriers have made it clear that the reduction in the rate will not bring a reduction in prices. For example, Leo Express spokesman Emil Sedlařík <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/\">told</a> Aktuálně.cz: <em>&quot;The reduction in the VAT rate comes at the same time as an increase in the prices of traction electricity, wages and other cost items. Thanks to the reduction in the VAT rate, we can better cover these increased expenses, which will not affect the price of our tickets.&quot;</em> Radek Joklík, spokesman for Czech Railways, made a similar <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/od-unora-se-snizi-dph-na-jizdne-dopravci-vsak-pravdepodobne/r~052836ac1a5e11e9a7e7ac1f6b220ee8/\">statement</a> .<br/><br/> For the reasons stated above, we evaluate the statement as true.<br/><br/></p>\nSECTION F: <p>The content of Article 122(2) <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=celex:12016ME/TXT\">of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> corresponds to the operative part.</p><p> <i>Article 122</i></p><p> <i>2. Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with serious difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may grant Union financial assistance to the Member State concerned under certain conditions.
