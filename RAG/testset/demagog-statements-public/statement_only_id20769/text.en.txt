I was not in contact with the auditors at all and I did not participate in any way in the responses to the European Commission. (...) I was not the one who stated, in response to the auditors&#39; criticisms, that in the case of a possible conflict of interest of Prime Minister Babi≈°, there was no violation of Czech or European laws. (...) I did not decide on the response to the European Commission. Our ministry only sent it because it has the role of the national authority for coordinating finances from EU funds.
