And I just want to remind you that the Czech Republic was &quot;scammed&quot; in Brussels by the then Deputy Minister of Finance Lukáš Wagenknecht, without the subsequent investigation finding anything illegal. So the monitoring system was investigated by the police, the Office for the Protection of Competition and the European Commission. And the latter finally told us that under pressure it would return the funding for European projects.
