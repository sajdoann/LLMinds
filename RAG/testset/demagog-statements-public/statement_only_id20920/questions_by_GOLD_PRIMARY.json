The Finns abstained. On behalf of the Czech Republic, the former Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) rejected the introduction of quotas. According to current EU rules, the proposal was accepted because the consent of all <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/IP_15_5596\">member states</a> was not required, but only a qualified majority.</p><p> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1601&amp;from=EN&amp;fbclid=IwAR2mO6h45kRLy7MRHjUZ6Dnrd0i6ZO_6-ZrdUwVnjbIP8dYdqawelyMmogw\">Council Decision 2015/1601</a> of 22 September 2015, which introduced the quotas, states in Article 13 that the decision <i>“shall apply until 26 September 2017”</i> and was therefore temporary.
