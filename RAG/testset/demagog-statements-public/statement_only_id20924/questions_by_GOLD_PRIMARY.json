    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>First of all, let us state that the part of the statement where Petr Fiala states that it was not easy for ODS not to field its candidate in every district is an opinion statement, and therefore we will not evaluate it as such.</p><p> ODS can be considered a traditional political party on the Czech scene (it was <a href=\"https://aplikace.mvcr.cz/seznam-politickych-stran/Vypis_Rejstrik.aspx?id=120\">founded</a> in 1991). The part of the statement regarding the 2018 Senate elections can also be considered completely true. New senators were elected in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=7&amp;xt=1\">27</a> districts and ODS nominated its representative in only<a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xobvod=0&amp;xv=1\">17</a> of them.</p><p> In other districts, ODS nominated a coalition candidate together with other parties. Such candidates included <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=44\">Jan Tecl</a> , who was nominated by ODS together with STAN, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=68\">Pavel Herbert</a> , a joint candidate of TOP 09, ODS and STAN, and <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=59\">Mikuláš Bek</a> .</p><p> Furthermore, ODS <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ods-volby-senat-obcanska-demokraticka-strana-cervicek-bek-fischer-kratina_1805261709_haf\">supported,</a> for example, the candidacies of Pavel Fischer in Prague, Hana Žáková in Třebíč, and Lukáš Libor in Zlín. It <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=2\">did not field</a> or <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ods-volby-senat-obcanska-demokraticka-strana-cervicek-bek-fischer-kratina_1805261709_haf\">support</a> any candidate in the Sokolov district.</p><p> At the same time, ODS clearly <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=7&amp;xt=1\">dominated</a> the elections, with its candidates winning <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=2\">a total of</a> 9 seats ahead of the second-place STAN movement with 3 mandates.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Fiala refers to the political mistake in the statement as coalition cooperation with the KSČM. The ODS banned such a form of cooperation by adopting <a href=\"https://docplayer.cz/9878146-Xvii-kongres-ods-xvii-kongres-ods-18-19-11-2006-praha.html\">a resolution</a> (p. 120) at the 17th Congress in 2006: <em>&quot;The ODS Congress orders the ODS Executive Board to revoke the licenses of local associations that cooperate in coalition with the KSČM at the municipal level.&quot;</em></p><p> The ODS <a href=\"https://moje.ods.cz/stanovy#clanek3\">statutes</a> state in Article 3, point 7, part f) on termination of membership: &quot; <em>Membership in the party terminates: by cancellation of membership by the local assembly or executive board due to a serious breach of obligations set out in section 3.14 of the statutes or due to a final conviction of a member for an intentional crime.&quot;</em> Further in point g): <em>&quot;if the local association terminates and the member does not submit an application for re-registration to another local association within three months of termination.&quot;</em></p><p> In Article 7, point 3, part f), the statutes state that the Executive Board&#39;s powers are &quot; <em>to decide on the establishment (by granting a license) and the dissolution (by revoking a license) of local associations&quot;.</em> In part h), it adds &quot; <em>to decide on the dissolution of membership pursuant to clause 3.7, letter f) of the statutes.&quot;</em></p><p> The Executive Board has decided to revoke the licenses of local associations in connection with cooperation with the KSČM several times. In <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1282064-ods-zrusila-18-sdruzeni-kvuli-spolupraci-s-kscm\">2011</a> , the licenses of 18 local associations were revoked. <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1290728-ods-hodla-kvuli-koalicim-s-kscm-zrusit-az-30-sdruzeni\"></a> There were <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1290728-ods-hodla-kvuli-koalicim-s-kscm-zrusit-az-30-sdruzeni\">30</a> local cells that were threatened with having their licenses revoked due to their coalition with the KSČM in 2011. One of the dissolved local associations was the organization in Rychnov nad Kněžnou. However, as <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/zakaz-koalic-s-komunisty-ods-nepomohl-mesta-ho-porusuji/r~4464b4d4560511e49bec0025900fea04/?redirected=1533021181\">the Aktuálně.cz</a> server found out, the cell there eventually reached an agreement with the party leadership and kept its license. This was despite the fact that the ODS members in Rychnov continued to form a coalition with the KSČM. For example, in Týnec nad Sázavou, the party cell was actually dissolved and the representatives continued to exercise their mandate as independents. At the same time, there are known cases where ODS members who entered a coalition with the communists at the local level announced their withdrawal from the ODS and decided to continue in the coalition as independents. This happened, for example, in <a href=\"https://vary.idnes.cz/starostove-kterym-zrusili-sdruzeni-chteji-opustit-ods-p2j-/vary-zpravy.aspx?c=A110301_095926_vary-zpravy_sou\">Aš and Březová</a> .</p><p> The ODS Executive Board dealt with the revocation of licenses from local cells due to coalition cooperation with the KSČM, for example, in 2007, when, according to the <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vykonna-rada-ods-resi-spolupraci-strany-s-komunisty-na-komunalni-urovni_200703312105_mmatusu\">iRozhlas.cz</a> server, two licenses were revoked in the Olomouc region. Thus, licenses are revoked from party cells in the event of non-compliance with the resolution from the 17th Congress prohibiting cooperation with the KSČM, although in some cases the license was ultimately not revoked.</p><p></p>\nSECTION C: <p>Fiala speaks about two things in his statement. According to him, the Global Compact on Migration is a vague document and ceases to distinguish between legal and illegal migration. As a second fact, he states that the same objections to this document are heard from other European countries. We do not take the phrase “most European countries” literally, but only verify whether these views appear in a larger number of countries.</p><p> <a href=\"https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/sites/default/files/180713_agreed_outcome_global_compact_for_migration.pdf\">The Global Compact</a> states that this document is not legally binding (p. 2, point 7). This is a declaration that does not contain any sanctions, and this type of document contains general principles rather than specific commitments.</p><p> As for the distinction between legal and illegal migration, the Covenant allows states to do so. “ <em>States may distinguish between legal and illegal migration status (...)</em> ” (paragraph 15, p. 4). However, it is a fact that in some points of the document the distinction between these statuses is no longer made. It is best to show this by example. For example, the signatories to the agreement declare in it (paragraph 13 h, p. 21) that they want to “ <em>protect and respect the rights and best interests of the child at all times, regardless of their migration status, by ensuring the availability of viable alternatives to detention in detention facilities. Priority is given to community-based care, ensuring access to education and health care, and respecting the right of children to family life and family unity (...)</em> ”.<em> </em>According to this point, it should not matter to states whether a child entered the country legally or illegally. What matters is the best interests of the child and states should treat both types of child migrants equally.</p><p> Now to the very core of our assessment, namely the question of whether similar objections to those of the ODS leader are also being raised in other European countries.</p><p> Looking at neighboring <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/2638163-viden-neprijme-globalni-pakt-osn-o-migraci-odmitame-spojovat-ochranu-s-ekonomickou\">Austria</a> , for example, Austrian Chancellor Kurz announced that his country would not join the Global Compact. He stated that the Global Compact does not help to solve migration issues, threatens Austrian sovereignty in matters of migration policy, and blurs the distinction between legal and illegal migration. Austria also raised <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-migrants-austria/austria-has-concerns-about-u-n-migration-pact-might-back-out-idUSKCN1MK2EJ\">doubts about the interpretation of</a> certain passages, for example whether the compact can be interpreted as a provision on migration as a human right.</p><p> <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/polsky-ministr-vnitra-chce-odstoupit-od-globalni-dohody-osn/r~12457374cbdd11e8b295ac1f6b220ee8/\">Poland</a> has also announced its intention not to join the Global Compact. Polish Interior Minister Brudzinski stated that the reasons for this step were that &quot; <em>in our opinion, the draft agreement does not guarantee Poland&#39;s security. Moreover, it may increase illegal migration</em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> The document is also being discussed in <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/488421-migracni-pakt-se-prici-i-casti-cdu-angely-merkelove.html\">Germany</a> . The opposition AfD party, for example, is against its adoption, but there are also critical voices from the ruling CDU/CSU. For example, MP Wendt is concerned about the lack of distinction between refugees and labor migration, while his colleague Mitsch is concerned that the Global Pact &quot; <em>will curtail Germany&#39;s sovereignty in migration issues</em> .&quot;</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2018/11/13/global-compact-for-migration-sound-and-fury/#77b11fd1297a\">Doubts</a> about the interpretation were also voiced in <a href=\"https://news.err.ee/876709/estonia-200-political-declaration-must-be-added-to-migration-compact\">Estonia</a> , where some political parties demanded that the government clarify the country&#39;s political position, i.e. prevent abuse of the ambiguous pact. <a href=\"https://domov.sme.sk/c/20954985/sns-pakt-o-migracii-osn-parlament-narodna-rada.html\">The Slovak discussion</a> then shows the uncertainty of individual parties and politicians regarding how the Pact can be understood and what obligations it brings to the signatories.</p><p></p>\nSECTION D: <p>In the parliamentary elections in 2013, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">384,174</a> votes, and in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">572,948</a> , or 49% more. This number fits within our tolerance of 10% deviation. In percentage terms, it was 7.72% and 11.32% of the votes, respectively. At the same time, the party received 56.25% more seats ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">25</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">16</a> ). </p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-69s2T\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/69s2T/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"273\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20161007&amp;xv=2\">2016</a> Senate elections, the party won only two mandates, compared to 9 in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005\">2018.</a> In the 2018 elections, it also <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/volby/senat?k=2&amp;t=uspesnost-stran\">defended</a> only 4 mandates. So, ODS is also succeeding in fulfilling this goal in the Senate elections. Moreover, ODS won in the last Senate elections, as Petr Fiala further claims. In <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=2\">2018</a> , ODS candidates won a total of 9 mandates in 27 constituencies. Candidates for the second most successful party, STAN, won only 3 mandates.</p><p> In the European Parliament elections, the party has also managed to meet the 50% growth target, and even significantly exceeded it. In 2014, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> votes, and in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , an increase of 196%. At the same time, the party received almost double the percentage of votes in 2018 ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">14.54%</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">7.67%</a> in 2014). The number of seats won by ODS doubled from two in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> to four in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">the last</a> elections. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the European Parliament elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ebPAZ\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ebPAZ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"290\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the context of the European elections, the part about second place, doubling the number of mandates and tripling the number of votes is also true. In the last EP elections, ODS indeed finished <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep?xjazyk=CZ\">second</a> behind the ANO movement. In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> elections, the party won 2 mandates, while in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">this year&#39;s</a> elections it won 4. The number of votes from 2014 is <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> , and from 2019 it was <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , which is approximately 2.96 times more.</p><p> In the elections to city and municipal councils, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9,178,453 votes in 2014. In 2018, it <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 14,905,827 votes. The result thus exceeds the target set by Fiala by 1,138,147 votes. In percentage terms, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9.26% of the votes in 2014, and 13.56% in <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">the following</a> elections. It therefore received 0.33% less than the commitment assumes. However, the result fits within our 10% tolerance. The party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 2,398 mandates in 2014, which is 3.86%. In <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">2018</a> , it received 2,600, or 4.2%. It is therefore clear that the party did not meet this Fiala target in terms of the number of mandates in the municipal elections. However, even in these elections, the commitment was fulfilled in two of the three possible calculation methods (absolute number of votes and percentage of votes), therefore we evaluate the statement as a whole as true. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in municipal elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-jUB4F\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jUB4F/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"277\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p></p>\nSECTION E: <p>In his statement, Fiala draws attention to the different positions of the last two foreign ministers, Hamáček and Petříček, on the Global Compact on Migration.</p><p> Jan Hamáček defended the adoption of this document during the discussion in <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/019schuz/bqbs/b20417001.htm\">the Chamber of Deputies</a> , stating, among other things: &quot; <em>I will try to explain to the chairman of the ODS club why it is good to have this document, even if it is non-binding.&quot;</em></p><p> His successor, Petříček, however, takes the opposite position.

However, the loudest opposition <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">came</a> from <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/mezinarodni-organizace-a-vs-visegradska-ctyrka.aspx\">the Visegrad Four</a> . The quotas <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">were</a> approved by EU interior ministers in September 2015.

In June 2017, for example, the Czech government <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vlada-cesko-uz-neprijme-zadneho-migranta-na-zaklade-kvot-zhorsila-se_1706051706_pj\">decided</a> that it would no longer accept any asylum seekers based on quotas, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">accepting</a> 12 of the 2,600 people allocated.</p><p> The European Commission then decided to open infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.

However, Armin Laschet, the CDU candidate for chancellor in the September German elections, has now expressed the opposite. After the capture of Kabul, <a href=\"https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fluechtlinge-afghanistan-121.html\">he stated</a> that Germany &quot; <i>must not give the impression that we can accept every person in need</i> &quot;.</p><p> French President Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/evropsky-parlament/v-evrope-rostou-nove-ploty-unie-se-boji-uprchlicke-vlny-z-af/r~a5d8490204d511ec966d0cc47ab5f122/\">spoke</a> about the need to &quot; <i>defend against illegal migration</i> &quot; after the fall of Kabul. His predecessor, François Hollande, chose a different rhetoric in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-france/hollande-opens-french-doors-to-refugees-despite-opposition-idUKKCN0R70WC20150907\">saying he</a> would &quot; <i>get the crisis under control</i> &quot; and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/french-president-francois-hollande-welcomes-refugees-paris-attack/story?id=35274658\">defending</a> his decision to uphold his refugee admission commitments despite the terrorist attacks in Paris.</p><p> Six EU member states, including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/six-countries-urge-eu-not-stop-deportations-afghanistan-belgium-says-2021-08-10/\">sent</a> a letter to the European Commission in early August 2021 warning against halting deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers, despite the Taliban&#39;s advance in their homeland. However, Germany, along with another signatory of the letter, the Netherlands, subsequently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">announced</a> that they would not deport the unaccepted Afghans for the time being due to the development of the conflict. However, Austria <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">did not change</a> its position and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-austria-pm-wont-take-in-any-more-afghanistan-refugees-taliban/\">ruled out</a> accepting people fleeing Afghanistan, saying that this would not happen during his term in office. The Greek Minister for Migration, whose country <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/grafika-reseni-migracni-krize/r~1a7e43b8e45911e59e52002590604f2e/\">faced</a> a strong influx of migrants due to its position during the last crisis and is another signatory of the letter, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">said</a> that &quot; <i>the EU is not prepared and does not have the capacity to handle another major migration crisis</i> &quot;.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
