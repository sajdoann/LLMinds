Today, the situation is significantly (...) different from the migration wave in 2015-2016. And what is different is that at that time, some European countries actually wanted to accept migrants and a dispute arose within Europe. And that is not the case today. If you look at the statements of all the leading representatives of European countries, including Germany, including the Netherlands, not to mention Austria, they all say no, this time we cannot accept any migration wave.
