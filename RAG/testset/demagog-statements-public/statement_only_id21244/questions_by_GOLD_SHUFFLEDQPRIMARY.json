Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The meeting of the House Committee on Security described in the statement, at which the &quot;information of the Director of the Security Information Service (BIS) on some articles published in the previous two weeks in the online edition of the Respekt periodical&quot; was <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173469\">discussed</a> ( <i>.doc)</i> , took place on May 6, 2020 and was <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4916&amp;dx=20200506\">not public</a> .</p><p> The meeting took place in response to <a href=\"https://www.respekt.cz/tydenik/2020/18/muz-s-ricinem\">an article</a> in the weekly magazine Respekt, in which Ondřej Kundra described the arrival of a man from Russia with a diplomatic passport who had ricin (a poison) in his briefcase. He also stated that security forces were aware of the traveler&#39;s arrival and assessed the man as an immediate risk to a pair of Czech politicians whose actions in recent months had drawn the ire of Moscow. These politicians were said to be Ondřej Kolář and Zdeněk Hřib. Ondřej Kundra supported this information with unspecified Respekt sources.</p><p> According to sources from the Czech Press Office, the Security Committee <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/reakce-bezpecnostnich-slozek-v-kauze-ricin-byla-podle-vyboru-adekvatni/1887589\">found</a> the response of the Czech security forces to be adequate.

This is only apparent from his answers, which contain expressions such as &quot; <i>generally speaking, I can note for the KSČM...&quot;</i> etc.</p><p> The newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/o-gazete/\">has been published</a> since 2018 with the subtitle Newspaper of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and was previously also the central press organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense. It is therefore possible to describe it as a military newspaper, as Vít Rakušan states. His description of this periodical as a magazine is somewhat more problematic, as the aforementioned subtitle already suggests, Krasnaya Zvezda describes itself as a newspaper. Despite this minor discrepancy, however, we generally assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Vít Rakušan is talking here about the statement of the chairman of the KSČM, Vojtěch Filip, who, in <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/vojteh-filip-bolshinstvo-grazhdan-cheshskoj-respubliki-vot-uzhe-75-let-ispytyvayut-chuvstvo-blagodarnosti-k-krasnoj-armii-2/\">an interview</a> published on May 15, 2020 by the Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, stated:</p><p> <i>“(…) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [is] departing from the national position when it criticizes the Russian Federation for not yet restoring war memorials on its territory to the fallen Czechoslovak legionnaires who fought in Samara, near Lipiag near Novokuybyshev and in other places in Russia with Russian revolutionary communists in 1918.</i></p><p> <i>Members of the KSČM and other citizens of the Czech Republic positively perceive the fact that the Russian government does not show interest in forcing local authorities to build monuments to those Czech legionnaires who did not liberate anyone in Russia and did nothing good for the most brilliant world socialist revolution of the last century in 1917 in Russia.”</i></p><p> The mentioned legionnaires who fought in <a href=\"http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:b5c8164d-afea-4a70-b22a-624680b5fdef?page=uuid:88aa7912-10f7-11e8-b8ac-005056b73ae5\">Samara</a> on the Volga in June 1918 (PLESKÝ, Metoděj. <i>4th Regiment of Prokop the Great</i> . 1936, p. 219) and at the Lipjagi station in the nearby city of Novokuybyshevsk (ibid., pp. 202–203) are soldiers of the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý and <a href=\"http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:dde50707-6b59-4eef-a3d6-916586657465?page=uuid:cefb781e-0fc9-11e8-ad37-005056b73ae5&amp;fulltext=samara\">the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi</a> (LANGER, František. <i>Memorial Book of the 1st Rifle Regiment of Jan Husi.</i> 1920, p. 44). They defeated the Bolshevik troops here, with whom they came into conflict mainly because the Russian side did not comply with the agreement on the departure of the Czechoslovak legionnaires via Vladivostok to France. Tomáš Jakl, a historian at the Military Historical Institute, <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/co-se-odehravalo-behem-velke-valky-na-vychodni-fronte/\">states</a> :</p><p> <i>&quot;However, at the end of April 1918, the transportation of Czechoslovak transports practically stopped due to pressure from Germany. In addition, at the end of May, the Soviet government attempted to completely disarm the Czechoslovak corps and transfer the Czechoslovaks either to the Red Army or to labor units. The Czechoslovak soldiers responded to this attempt by deciding to leave for Vladivostok on their own.&quot;</i></p><p> Before the beginning of the conflicts with the Bolsheviks, these Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia had already achieved a number of military successes in battles with the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. In March 1918, for example, the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý took part in the Battle of <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/exhibit/ruske-legie-v-bitve-u-bachmace-1918/\">Bachmač</a> , where an important railway junction was located. And above all, the soldiers of the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi fought victoriously at <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/zborov-bitva-ktera-cs-vojakum-vydobyla-respekt/\">Zborov</a> in early July 1917.</p><p> Currently, both cities are located in Ukraine, and at the time of the fighting, Bachmač was part of the independent <a href=\"http://www.haidamaka.org.ua/obr/sxslob/mapaunr.jpg\">Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic</a> and Zborov was part of <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Europe_1918.jpg\">the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</a> However, it is important to mention that, for example, Bachmač was still part of <a href=\"https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/map-russian-empire-1914\">the Russian Empire</a> at the beginning of World War I. Let us add that at Zborov, the entire Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade was directly subordinated to the Russian <a href=\"https://kramerius.army.cz/search/i.jsp?pid=uuid:0fee9338-6380-4fab-8551-ecef91c582d5&amp;q=&amp;fq=document_type:%22monograph%22&amp;fq=keywords:%221.%20%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A1%20d%C4%9Blost%C5%99eleck%C3%A1%20brig%C3%A1da%22#monograph-page_uuid:51ea50b3-0fc3-11e8-927a-005056b73ae5\">49th Army Corps</a> (KAVENA, Karel. <i>History of the 1st Artillery Regiment of Jan Žižka of Trocnov in the Russian Revolution and in the Fatherland</i> . 1937, p. 44). It is also an indisputable fact that the 4th and 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiments, with their work (along with many others), helped Russia to achieve final victory on the Eastern European battlefield.</p><p> According to historians, the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian army near the town of Zborov also <a href=\"https://books.google.cz/books?id=li-2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=v%C3%BDznam+zborova+samostatn%C3%A9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkOxi0hmPp&amp;sig=ACfU3U2orK3G_vX83GzgA2tpeU7ffHK1ew&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiv3P358sfpAhXJ8OAKHZvtAqQQ6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A9%20st%C3%A1tn%C3%AD%20samostatnosti&amp;f=false\">played</a> (MOJŽÍŠ, Milan, RAK, Michal et al. <i>Zborov 1917–2017</i> . 2019, p. 150) along with other combat actions of Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia a very <a href=\"http://www.acr.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=11914\">important role</a> in political negotiations on the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak Republic. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Zborov in 2017, for example, the Chamber of Deputies adopted <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=10179\">a resolution</a> that ends with the words: <i>&quot;The deeds of the legionnaires should never be forgotten. The heroes of Zborov have contributed to the state.&quot;</i></p><p> For these reasons, Vojtěch Filip&#39;s statement can to some extent be considered as questioning the historical role of these units, as Vít Rakušan states in the statement. However, it is clear from the statement that Vojtěch Filip directly questioned the role of the legionnaires in the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia. Filip spoke only about their importance for Russia and the revolution in Russia. Rakušan thus presents Filip&#39;s statement in a misleading context.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Vít Rakušan <a href=\"https://www.vitrakusan.cz/zivotopis/\">studied</a> history, German studies, and school management. He then <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2786660-z-ucitele-nemciny-hvezdou-komunalni-politiky-rakusan-zacal-karieru-jako-nestranik\">taught</a> German at a grammar school in Kutná Hora.</p><p> The Russian Liberation Army (ROA), known as the Vlasovs, <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/exhibit/rukavovy-znak-jednotek-ruske-osvobozenecke-armady-vlasovcu/\">was formed</a> in November 1944. This happened after General Vlasov <a href=\"https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach\">was captured</a> by the Germans during the defense of Leningrad. The ROA <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/veda-technologie/historie/ustr-historik-historie-osvobozeni-cesko-rusko-vlasovci_1912141111_hag\">members</a> included Soviet prisoners of war and the so-called white emigration, or people who left the USSR in the 1920s and decided to fight against Stalin. Their main <a href=\"https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach\">goal</a> was to defeat Stalin. Germany was to help them achieve these goals. On the side of Nazi Germany, <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">they fought</a> against the USSR in the area between the Oder and the Neisse.</p><p> However, in the spring of 1945, it became <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">clear</a> to Vlasov (audio, time from 15:30) that he could not count on Germany&#39;s help in the long-term fight against Stalin. On the contrary, the Germans were rather using Vlasov&#39;s army for their own purposes. For this reason, he decided to leave Germany with his army for Linz. In an attempt to win the favor of the Allied (or American) troops, he then decided, together with General Bunyachenko, to help liberate Prague.</p><p> <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/zradci-a-vrazi-nebo-zneuznani-osvoboditele-diskuze-o-vyznamu-kontroverznich-8121440\">They arrived</a> in Prague on May 5, 1945. They fought mainly on the southern bank and their greatest success was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2989820-vlasovci-necekane-pomohli-pri-prazskem-povstani-predtim-bojovali-s-hitlerem-proti\">the capture</a> of Ruzyně. German planes took off from there to bomb Prague. Around 300 Vlasov soldiers <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2989820-vlasovci-necekane-pomohli-pri-prazskem-povstani-predtim-bojovali-s-hitlerem-proti\">died</a> in these battles.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>Vít Rakušan talks about the resolution in connection with <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/babisuv-odhalil-ze-si-tiskne-vladni-maily-ve-firme-ze-sverenskych-fondu-98372\">the case of</a> Prime Minister Babiš from the beginning of April. During his regular <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2SwQpWtZTQE?t=332\">weekend report</a> (video) on his YouTube channel, Andrej Babiš read information about the financing of the health sector from a piece of paper on which an e-mail addressed to the Prime Minister from the Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, was printed on the other side. Minister Vojtěch sent the message to the Prime Minister&#39;s private e-mail address, who then forwarded it to an employee of the IMOBA company, who printed it for him.</p><p> <a href=\"https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vysledky?subjektId=713630&amp;typ=PLATNY\">IMOBA</a> is a member of the SynBiol concern, which is part of Andrej Babiš&#39;s <a href=\"https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66371830-kdo-je-kdo-ve-sverenskych-fondech-pres-ktere-podle-expertu-babis-dal-ovlada-agrofert-dulezite-funkce-maji-premierovi-pravnici-i-manzelka\">trust fund</a> called AB private trust I. The video also shows that Prime Minister Babiš uses his personal address with the domain &quot;e-babis.cz&quot; for government email communication. In response to the video, a wave of criticism arose, firstly, regarding the Prime Minister&#39;s continuing ties to his former trust companies and secondly, due to the way the Prime Minister operates with potentially sensitive government information on unsecured email addresses.</p><p> The 37th meeting of the House Committee on Security took place on May 14. According to its <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173747&amp;pdf=1\">invitation</a> (.pdf), the deputies were to discuss the 5th item <i>&quot;Securing government materials when using private e-mail addresses by the Prime Minister and members of the government&quot;.</i> This item was proposed by Vít Rakušan, and the head of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security Karel Řehka was also invited to comment. It is true that due to time constraints, this item <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-e-maily-soukroma-posta-imoba-bezpecnostni-vybor-poslanci-snemovna_2005190600_kno\">was not</a> discussed and was postponed to the next meeting of the House of Representatives, which is scheduled to take place at the end of May.</p><p> This particular meeting of the Security Committee was not public according to <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173747&amp;pdf=1\">the invitation</a> and no <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4905&amp;ido=1311&amp;kk=4&amp;td=3&amp;n=2\">minutes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4905&amp;ido=1311&amp;kk=5&amp;td=1&amp;n=9\">resolutions</a> have been made available yet. Therefore, we cannot verify whether the draft resolution that Vít Rakušan mentions actually contained information regarding the methodology of internet communication of government members.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>&quot; <i>I am ready to support a resolution that clearly states that the Chamber of Deputies values the role of the legionnaires in the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic,&quot;</i> Jan Hamáček said on May 17 in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions ( <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/220411030500517/\">video</a> , time 17:28). Further in the discussion, Jan Hamáček emphasized that it is necessary to clearly state what the role of our legionnaires was in the past.</p><p> This statement corresponds to part of the draft resolution of the Chamber of Deputies, which was presented on May 18 by the chairman of the STAN movement, Vít Rakušan.
