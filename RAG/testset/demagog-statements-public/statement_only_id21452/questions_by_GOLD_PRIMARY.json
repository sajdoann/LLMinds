    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p><a href=\"https://www.litcentrum.sk/autor/vojtech-mihalik/zivotopis-autora\">Vojtech Mihálik</a> was a Slovak poet and politician. In the years 1954–1959 he was the secretary of the Slovak Writers&#39; Association, and in the years 1965–1967 he was its chairman. He also worked as the editor-in-chief of the publishing house Slovenský spisovateľ. Since 1969 he has also held political and state positions, being the chairman of the Chamber of Nations in the Federal Assembly of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and also an advisor to the government. In the years 1966–1981 <a href=\"http://195.46.72.16/free/jsp/search/view/ViewerFoto.jsp?Document=..%2F..%2FFondyF%2F11%2F03%2F572524-1.1%40Foto&amp;QueryText=\">he was</a> a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS).</p><p> One of <a href=\"https://obetiokupace.dejepis21.cz/\">the victims</a> of the Warsaw Pact occupation was the Slovak student <a href=\"https://www.ustrcr.cz/uvod/srpen-1968/obeti-okupace/obeti-okupace-zapadni-slovensko/\">Dana Košanová</a> . On August 21, 1968, in the afternoon, she was <a href=\"http://okupace.evangnet.cz/kosanova-margita\">hit</a> by fire from Soviet soldiers on the steps of Comenius University in Bratislava. With a serious injury to her lumbar region, she was transported to the II. Surgical Department of the Faculty Hospital in Partyzánská Street in Bratislava, where she died the same day despite the care provided. Dana Košanová&#39;s name is listed on a memorial <a href=\"http://multimedia.ctk.cz/foto/document/2072179/2\">plaque</a> at the entrance to the Faculty of Law of Comenius University.</p><p> Vojtech Mihálik responded suggestively to the entry of Soviet troops and the tragic death of student Dana Košanová in his poem <em>Requiem</em> , <a href=\"https://is.muni.cz/th/m54go/DiseDise_240918.pdf\">published</a> (p. 163) on September 5, 1968 in a special edition of the weekly <em>Nové slovo.</em> With the help of the library staff of the Faculty of Social Sciences of Charles University, we managed to obtain the original text of the poem, from which President Zeman correctly quoted the part that deals with the murder of Dana Košanová.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>President Miloš Zeman, at a meeting with foreign ambassadors on October 27, 2019, did indeed begin <a href=\"https://www.hrad.cz/cs/prezident-cr/soucasny-prezident-cr/vybrane-projevy-a-rozhovory/projev-prezidenta-republiky-pri-setkani-se-cleny-diplomatickeho-sboru-15112\">his speech</a> with almost identical words: <em>&quot;Distinguished ambassadors, dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends of the Czech Republic, welcome to a successful country! Welcome to a country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, stable economic growth, and very low national debt.&quot;</em> He did not mention the declining national debt at the time.</p><p> We consider the opening words to be true in terms of content as well. The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is indeed the lowest in the European Union. According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics\">Eurostat data from October 2019</a> , it is 2.2%, while the average unemployment rate in the EU-28 is 6.3%.</p><p> If we measure economic growth by GDP, then the Czech Republic is truly in a period of growth. According to <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/92010940/chmu100119.xlsx/d8a25f9f-e671-4fd1-a1f7-0b090610fbbd?version=1.0\">Czech Statistical Office data</a> (.xlsx), GDP has been growing by at least 2.5% year-on-year since 2013.</p><p> President Miloš Zeman says that the state debt is relatively decreasing and low. It is true that in relative terms of state debt to GDP, the debt is indeed decreasing. As can be seen <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">in Eurostat data</a> , this trend has been evident since 2013, when the debt was at 44.9%. In 2018, the share of state debt to GDP was 32.6%. However, in absolute numbers, state debt is not clearly decreasing, on the contrary, it is rather fluctuating, which can be traced <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/rizeni-statniho-dluhu/dluhova-statistika/struktura-a-vyvoj-statniho-dluhu\">in the data of the Ministry of Finance</a> . According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">Eurostat data,</a> the debt of the Czech Republic is one of the lowest in the EU. The average share of state debt to GDP in the EU is 80.4%. Estonia and Bulgaria, for example, have lower relative state debt than the Czech Republic.</p><p> The average wage growth is reported <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/prace_a_mzdy_prace\">by the Czech Statistical Office</a> . In the 3rd quarter of 2019, the average wage reached CZK 33,697 (increased by 6.9% year-on-year).</p><p> The growth of old-age pensions can be monitored, for example, <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/statni-rozpocet/hospodareni-systemu-duchodoveho-pojisten\">on data from the Ministry of Finance</a> . In 2016, the average old-age pension was CZK 11,460, in 2017 it was CZK 11,850, and in 2018 the average old-age pension reached CZK 12,418.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>To evaluate this statement, we will use only a quote from the Constitution of the Czech Republic. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl68\">Article 68</a> , which states:</p><p> <i>“(1) The Government is responsible to the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> <i>(2) The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President of the Republic and, upon his proposal, shall appoint the other members of the Government and entrust them with the management of ministries or other offices.</i></p><p> <i>(3) The Government shall appear before the Chamber of Deputies within thirty days of its appointment and request a vote of confidence.</i></p><p> <i>(4) If the newly appointed government does not gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the procedure shall be as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. If the government thus appointed also fails to gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Republic shall appoint the Prime Minister on the proposal of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> It is precisely the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned article in the Constitution that describes that in the event of a vote of no confidence being cast on the first attempt, the same procedure is followed again. However, if a vote of no confidence is cast on the second attempt, a third attempt follows, during which the power to select the Prime Minister lies with the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> Let us add that this constitutional procedure gives the President of the Republic considerable room for discretion. In particular, the Constitution does not dictate to the President who should be appointed Prime Minister in each attempt to form a government. As a rule, this is the chairman of the party that won the election, but as Miloš Zeman mentions in a verified interview, the coalition potential of individual parliamentary parties also plays a role. Let us recall the parliamentary elections in 2010, when the ČSSD won, but President Klaus instead of Bohuslav Sobotka <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sanci-vyjednat-vladu-ma-necas-sobotku-klaus-zklamal/r~i:article:670008/\">entrusted</a> the formation of the government to the chairman of <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2010/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">the second</a> ODS, Petr Nečas, whom he subsequently <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/klaus-jmenoval-necase-premierem-45608\">appointed</a> Prime Minister.</p><p> A similar case occurred in 2013 after the fall of the Nečas government, when the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Miroslava Němcová had 101 parliamentary signatures in support of a possible new government, but President Zeman instead <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1090181-vladu-sestavi-ekonom-rusnok-rozhodl-zeman\">tasked</a> Jiří Rusnok with forming a caretaker government and subsequently <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/-vladu-odborniku-povede-rusnok-prezident-zeman-ho-jmenoval-premierem_201306251920_mskalicky\">appointed</a> him prime minister.</p><p> Even in the second attempt to appoint a prime minister who will form a government with confidence, there is no stipulation as to who should be appointed, especially that it should be the “second in line.” In 2018, for example, President Zeman <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/premier-andrej-babis-prezident-milos-zeman-podruhe_1806061400_ako\">appointed</a> Andrej Babiš as prime minister even after his government failed to win confidence in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Miloš Zeman spoke about the need to abolish tax exemptions in the Chamber of Deputies in <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/035schuz/s035223.htm\">2019</a> , and a year later, in his budget speech at <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/062schuz/index.htm\">the 62nd meeting</a> of the Chamber of Deputies, <a href=\"https://www.hrad.cz/cs/prezident-cr/soucasny-prezident-cr/vybrane-projevy-a-rozhovory/projev-prezidenta-republiky-pri-62.-schuzi-poslanecke-snemovny-15653\">he stated</a> : <i>&quot;We calculated with Minister Schillerová that abolishing tax exemptions and reliefs would represent 380 billion crowns.&quot;</i> However, it is not certain how they calculated this 380 billion, because the former Minister of Finance Alena Schillerová herself later <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/v-mediich/2021/ministryne-financi-alena-schillerova-hos-41828\">mentioned</a> 300 billion in <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3310573-schillerova-vidi-cestu-z-krize-v-investicich-dle-wagenknechta-a-zamrazilove-se\">an interview</a> on Czech Television, while in <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/v-mediich/2021/nechme-dane-nizke-zrusme-vyjimky-41999\">a second</a> interview she spoke about 330 billion.</p><p> In addition to the Minister&#39;s words, the last official calculation of tax reliefs was from 2018, when, according to <a href=\"https://www.kurzy.cz/zpravy/597053-muze-ceskou-verejnou-kasu-zachranit-zruseni-danovych-vyjimek/\">estimates</a> by the Ministry of Finance (MF), the total value was over 500 billion crowns. The total tax relief is calculated from tax reliefs for personal income tax, corporate income tax and value added tax. According to <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=20996\">the document</a> (.pdf, p. 1) Quantification of tax reliefs in the Czech Republic for 2018, which was published as an annex to the Fiscal Outlook of the Ministry of Finance, the total tax reliefs in 2018 amounted to <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=20996\">520 billion CZK</a> (.pdf, p. 5).</p><p> At the same time, however, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=20996\">there is no</a> (.pdf, p. 1) uniform methodology for calculating these reliefs and no other restrictive rules for the form of tax relief analysis are given. The difference in the estimate of the Ministry of Finance and Alena Schillerová may therefore be caused by a different methodology.</p><p> The state budget deficit should amount to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2020-600#p1-1\">500 billion</a> crowns this year according to the State Budget Act, but this plan is unlikely to be fulfilled. The state budget <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2021/pokladni-plneni-sr-43761\">ended</a> with a deficit of 401.5 billion crowns at the end of November, and it can therefore be assumed that the resulting deficit for 2021 will not be much higher. The aforementioned 380 billion crowns almost reach this year&#39;s estimated deficit.</p><p> Miloš Zeman is therefore correct in stating that he spoke about tax exemptions in the past in the Chamber of Deputies and even mentioned the amount of 380 billion crowns at that time. This sum does not correspond to the estimates of the former Minister of Finance or the estimates of the Ministry of Finance from 2018. Although they differ significantly, Miloš Zeman&#39;s 380 billion is between these estimates, which also do not have a uniform methodology. We therefore assess his statement as true with reservations.</p><p> For context, let us add that <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/assets/cs/media/Dane_Zprava_2014_o-danovych-ulevach-v-Ceske-republice-za-roky-2011-2015.pdf\">a tax relief</a> is a measure (.pdf, p. 5) that is an advantage for the taxpayer in the form of lower or later tax payments compared to the situation where such a measure would not be included in the law. The reason for introducing a tax relief may be to support other public policies (for example, reducing taxes for taxpayers whose economic activity the state wants to support), achieving greater efficiency of the tax system (for example, exempting taxpayers with relatively low or zero incomes), or a combination of both.</p><p> Tax reliefs include, for example, tax exemptions, items reducing the tax base, items reducing the tax, reduced tax rates, etc. More specifically, for personal income tax, tax-exempt items include, for example, income in the form of awards in <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-586#p4-1-f\">the field of culture</a> , income in the form <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1992-586#p4-1-k\">of scholarships</a> from the state budget or from university funds.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The ruling <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-za-novu-do-konce-dubna.A030318_144623_domaci_has\">refers</a> to property disputes from 1999 to 2003 between TV Nova CEO Vladimír Železný (or CET 21, the broadcasting license <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/zelezny-prejmenuje-cet-21-na-tv-nova.A_990419_170757_domaci_jpl\">holder</a> ) and American investors (CME). CME claims that its investments in TV Nova were <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/cesko-musi-cme-zaplatit-10-miliard-korun_200303151837_mtaborska\">damaged</a> by Vladimír Železný&#39;s attempt to cut off foreign investors.</p><p> CEO Železný was <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-kvuli-nove-miliardy.A030314_200747_domaci_jpl\">supported</a> in his attempt to spin off TV Nova from CME in 1999 by the Radio and Television Broadcasting Council, which is vaguely referred to in the ruling. These circumstances resulted in arbitration proceedings (or arbitral proceedings) that ended against the Czech Republic, which had <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/assets/cs/media/Dohoda_DPOI-USA-cesky.pdf\">an obligation</a> (.pdf) to protect American foreign investments. The victorious company CME <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/rozhodnuto-cesko-za-arbitraz-zaplatilo.A030515_095759_domaci_has\">received</a> over 10 billion crowns from the state in the arbitration dispute.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>General Motors is an American multinational corporation that is one of the world&#39;s largest car manufacturers. However, it ran into major problems, among other things due to the effects of the global economic crisis of 2008. GM has had enough of its own problems over the past decade, such as a constantly declining market share, with the price per share gradually <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/05/31/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy_looms/index.htm?postversion=2009053112\">falling</a> to almost 75 cents. </p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/chart_gm_shrinking.03.gif\"><figcaption> Source: <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/\">CNN</a></figcaption></figure><p> But the Great Recession also meant that car sales dropped significantly. All of these factors led GM to declare <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/ceska-ekonomika/obri-bankrot-automobilky-je-tu-gm-chce-ochranu/r~i:article:638814/?redirected=1532723355\">bankruptcy</a> on June 1, 2009. On the same day, the company filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. The administration of then-President Barack Obama bailed out GM with a nearly $50 billion <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">injection</a> of cash, for which it acquired a 60.8% stake in the company. Canada also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1405425-automobilka-general-motors-zbankrotovala\">bought</a> part of the company, and the United Auto Workers union bought another part. The United States then gradually sold off this stake, for which it collected $39 billion. The last part of its stake <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/12/09/government-treasury-gm-general-motors-tarp-bailout-exit-sale/3925515/\">was sold by</a> the United States in December 2013.</p><p> General Motors remained in bankruptcy for only 39 days and soon returned to the stock market thanks to reorganization. As part of the restructuring, the company <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">stopped</a> production of some unprofitable brands such as Hummer, Pontiac and Saturn. The company also closed some of its factories and focused on a narrower selection of brands - such as Chevrolet and Cadillac. The US entry into car manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler ultimately saved 1.5 million jobs. It is estimated that the US <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-bailout-study-idUSL1N0JO0XU20131209\">saved</a> $ 105 billion in collecting social security payments and social benefits for people who would have lost their jobs due to the bankruptcy.</p><p> The Czech Republic can help Czech companies in this way. <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66746670-vlada-hodla-vstoupit-do-vyznamnych-soukromych-firem\">According to</a> Deputy Prime Minister Karel Havlíček, this would be a similar model to that outlined by Miloš Zeman using the example of the USA and General Motors. &quot; <i>We call it the American model, it is not socialization, as we are now being criticized a lot.&quot;</i> Many states are trying to save their strategic companies in this way, as are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesasquith/2020/04/01/could-airlines-be-nationalised-as-italy-takes-full-ownership-of-alitalia-will-more-airlines-follow/#59f3640877df\">airlines</a> .</p><p> Finance Minister Alena Schillerová and the government of Andrej Babiš have <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66751220-schillerova-chce-zestatnovat\">proposed</a> that shares in some Czech companies, such as CSA, should be bought back and then <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66749800-deficit-200-miliard-i-pristi-rok\">sold</a> again, following the American model. Czech Airlines <a href=\"https://www.lidovky.cz/byznys/doprava/zachrana-csa-verdikt-zrejme-padne-do-dvou-tydnu.A200416_130657_ln-doprava_ele\">is</a> currently 98 percent owned by Smartwings, 49 percent of which is owned by the Chinese state-owned company CITIC. However, this proposal is criticized by many economists and experts who do not consider CSA to be a strategic enterprise, and <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/koronahelpdesk-e15/v-cesku-zadna-strategicka-firma-ke-znarodneni-neni-shoduje-se-opozice-s-analytiky-1368824\">the opposition</a> is also opposed. Petr Bartoň, the chief economist of the Natland group, compared the situation between CSA and GM for <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/znarodneni-csa-nic-neresi-rika-ekonom-40321128\">Novinky.cz</a> : &quot; <i>The management is not in a state of catastrophic failure and it is not an irreplaceable critical infrastructure. CSA was only prohibited from offering its services. There would be demand, but citizens are prohibited from traveling anywhere. This can be solved with existing programs to maintain economic relations for the rest of the economy. That is, if those programs were sufficient.&quot;</i></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
