(...) a proposal that I have repeatedly expressed in my budget speeches in the Chamber of Deputies. This proposal consists of abolishing tax exemptions. If all tax exemptions were abolished, I said that it would save 380 billion crowns. Which is almost as much as the estimated state budget deficit this year.
