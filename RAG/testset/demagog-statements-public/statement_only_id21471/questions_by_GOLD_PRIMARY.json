    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Petr Fiala answered <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030501017/#t=48m28s\">a question</a> in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions (video, time 48:28) that mentioned that more than a million voters lost their votes in the parliamentary elections, and are therefore not represented in the Chamber of Deputies. Petr Fiala stated (time 49:22) that <i>&quot;good government governs for everyone, even for those who did not vote for it&quot;</i> . He then illustrates this position by referring to his older statement from the election staff, which is the content of the verified statement.</p><p> Petr Fiala, in the SPOLU coalition&#39;s election staff, gave his first post-election speech on October 9, when <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3383514-zmeny-je-tady-my-jsme-ji-slibili-my-ji-udelame-rekl-lidr-spolu-fiala\">he said</a> (video, time 1:52): <i>&quot;(…) I would like to ask you something in this context. All of you who are watching us. It doesn&#39;t matter who you voted for, it doesn&#39;t matter what your political preferences are. First and foremost, we are all citizens of the Czech Republic who want to live here and we want to live here together, as neighbors, as friends, as colleagues. That is what unites us all.&quot;</i></p><p> Let us add that the SPOLU coalition <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps124?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xkraj=0&amp;xstrana=13&amp;xv=1\">, consisting of</a> ODS, TOP 09 and KDU-ČSL, won <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">27.79%</a> of the votes in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, finishing first.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>First of all, let us state that the part of the statement where Petr Fiala states that it was not easy for ODS not to field its candidate in every district is an opinion statement, and therefore we will not evaluate it as such.</p><p> ODS can be considered a traditional political party on the Czech scene (it was <a href=\"https://aplikace.mvcr.cz/seznam-politickych-stran/Vypis_Rejstrik.aspx?id=120\">founded</a> in 1991). The part of the statement regarding the 2018 Senate elections can also be considered completely true. New senators were elected in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=7&amp;xt=1\">27</a> districts and ODS nominated its representative in only<a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xobvod=0&amp;xv=1\">17</a> of them.</p><p> In other districts, ODS nominated a coalition candidate together with other parties. Such candidates included <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=44\">Jan Tecl</a> , who was nominated by ODS together with STAN, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=68\">Pavel Herbert</a> , a joint candidate of TOP 09, ODS and STAN, and <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=59\">Mikuláš Bek</a> .</p><p> Furthermore, ODS <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ods-volby-senat-obcanska-demokraticka-strana-cervicek-bek-fischer-kratina_1805261709_haf\">supported,</a> for example, the candidacies of Pavel Fischer in Prague, Hana Žáková in Třebíč, and Lukáš Libor in Zlín. It <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=2\">did not field</a> or <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ods-volby-senat-obcanska-demokraticka-strana-cervicek-bek-fischer-kratina_1805261709_haf\">support</a> any candidate in the Sokolov district.</p><p> At the same time, ODS clearly <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=7&amp;xt=1\">dominated</a> the elections, with its candidates winning <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=2\">a total of</a> 9 seats ahead of the second-place STAN movement with 3 mandates.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>We were unable to find the letter mentioned by Petr Fiala in publicly available sources, so we contacted the European Commission Representation in the Czech Republic to ask whether the President of the European Commission had received the letter from Prime Minister Petr Fiala with the request that Fiala was talking about.</p><p> The Head of the Representation&#39;s Press Department, <a href=\"https://czechia.representation.ec.europa.eu/novinky-udalosti/tiskove-centrum_cs\">Magdaléna Frouzová,</a> confirmed to us that European Commission President Von Der Leyen received a letter from Fiala: <i>&quot;Yes, we can confirm that the President of the Commission received a letter from the Czech Prime Minister, in which she formulates the position of the Czech government supporting the inclusion of gas and nuclear energy in the EU taxonomy, in full accordance with the resolution adopted by both chambers of the Czech Parliament on December 15, 2021.&quot;</i></p><p> Petr Fiala also refers to the resolution of the Czech Parliament in his statement. On December 14, 2021, the Chamber of Deputies <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2021ps/stenprot/004schuz/bqbs/b02100901.htm\">voted</a> on <i>the Resolution of the Parliament on the necessary role of nuclear energy in the decarbonization of the economy</i> . This is <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=15300\">a resolution</a> according to which the Chamber of Deputies:</p><ul><li> notes that the Czech Republic has committed to the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal,</li><li> appreciates that the EU recognises the right of Member States to freely choose the composition of their energy mix,</li><li> stresses that the Czech Republic, due to its geographical conditions, is unable to meet its obligations without the use of nuclear energy,</li><li> recalls that the important role of nuclear energy was also confirmed by the President of the European Commission,</li><li> therefore notes that nuclear energy must be fully recognised as part of the solution for decarbonising the economy. It cannot be seen as just a &quot;transitional&quot; category, but as a tool that &quot;enables&quot; the low-carbon transformation of the economy and makes it economically and socially sustainable in the long term. The criteria for the sustainability of the low-carbon transformation of the economy should be technologically neutral and must not differentiate between generations of nuclear installations or reactor technology,</li><li> also notes that the Czech Republic intends to temporarily use natural gas in its mix,</li><li> Calls on the EU to include gas as a transitional source and nuclear energy as a sustainable source,</li><li> instructs Andrej Babiš, the outgoing Prime Minister, to present this opinion to the European Council at its meeting on 15 December 2021.</li></ul><p> The majority of deputies, with the exception of SPD representatives, voted <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=77438&amp;l=cz\">in favor of</a> this proposal. The Senate also <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/senat-ve-shode-se-snemovnou-podporil-vyuzivani-jaderne-energie/2133449\">supported</a> the Chamber of Deputies&#39; resolution the following day.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Fiala speaks about two things in his statement. According to him, the Global Compact on Migration is a vague document and ceases to distinguish between legal and illegal migration. As a second fact, he states that the same objections to this document are heard from other European countries. We do not take the phrase “most European countries” literally, but only verify whether these views appear in a larger number of countries.</p><p> <a href=\"https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/sites/default/files/180713_agreed_outcome_global_compact_for_migration.pdf\">The Global Compact</a> states that this document is not legally binding (p. 2, point 7). This is a declaration that does not contain any sanctions, and this type of document contains general principles rather than specific commitments.</p><p> As for the distinction between legal and illegal migration, the Covenant allows states to do so. “ <em>States may distinguish between legal and illegal migration status (...)</em> ” (paragraph 15, p. 4). However, it is a fact that in some points of the document the distinction between these statuses is no longer made. It is best to show this by example. For example, the signatories to the agreement declare in it (paragraph 13 h, p. 21) that they want to “ <em>protect and respect the rights and best interests of the child at all times, regardless of their migration status, by ensuring the availability of viable alternatives to detention in detention facilities. Priority is given to community-based care, ensuring access to education and health care, and respecting the right of children to family life and family unity (...)</em> ”.<em> </em>According to this point, it should not matter to states whether a child entered the country legally or illegally. What matters is the best interests of the child and states should treat both types of child migrants equally.</p><p> Now to the very core of our assessment, namely the question of whether similar objections to those of the ODS leader are also being raised in other European countries.</p><p> Looking at neighboring <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/2638163-viden-neprijme-globalni-pakt-osn-o-migraci-odmitame-spojovat-ochranu-s-ekonomickou\">Austria</a> , for example, Austrian Chancellor Kurz announced that his country would not join the Global Compact. He stated that the Global Compact does not help to solve migration issues, threatens Austrian sovereignty in matters of migration policy, and blurs the distinction between legal and illegal migration. Austria also raised <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-migrants-austria/austria-has-concerns-about-u-n-migration-pact-might-back-out-idUSKCN1MK2EJ\">doubts about the interpretation of</a> certain passages, for example whether the compact can be interpreted as a provision on migration as a human right.</p><p> <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/polsky-ministr-vnitra-chce-odstoupit-od-globalni-dohody-osn/r~12457374cbdd11e8b295ac1f6b220ee8/\">Poland</a> has also announced its intention not to join the Global Compact. Polish Interior Minister Brudzinski stated that the reasons for this step were that &quot; <em>in our opinion, the draft agreement does not guarantee Poland&#39;s security. Moreover, it may increase illegal migration</em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> The document is also being discussed in <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/488421-migracni-pakt-se-prici-i-casti-cdu-angely-merkelove.html\">Germany</a> . The opposition AfD party, for example, is against its adoption, but there are also critical voices from the ruling CDU/CSU. For example, MP Wendt is concerned about the lack of distinction between refugees and labor migration, while his colleague Mitsch is concerned that the Global Pact &quot; <em>will curtail Germany&#39;s sovereignty in migration issues</em> .&quot;</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2018/11/13/global-compact-for-migration-sound-and-fury/#77b11fd1297a\">Doubts</a> about the interpretation were also voiced in <a href=\"https://news.err.ee/876709/estonia-200-political-declaration-must-be-added-to-migration-compact\">Estonia</a> , where some political parties demanded that the government clarify the country&#39;s political position, i.e. prevent abuse of the ambiguous pact. <a href=\"https://domov.sme.sk/c/20954985/sns-pakt-o-migracii-osn-parlament-narodna-rada.html\">The Slovak discussion</a> then shows the uncertainty of individual parties and politicians regarding how the Pact can be understood and what obligations it brings to the signatories.</p><p></p>\nSECTION E: <p>The European refugee crisis, as the wave of migration to Europe in 2015 and 2016 was called, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/czech-republic/news/migrace/migrace_historicky_prehled_cs\">began</a> in the spring of 2015 and was caused by the escalation of the <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3283818-krvavy-konflikt-v-syrii-vypukl-pred-deseti-lety-u-moci-zustava-oslabeny-basar-asad\">war</a> in Syria. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/48Cio/1/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-48Cio\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" title=\"Number of asylum applications to EU countries\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></figure><p> A dispute arose in the European Union over the redistribution of refugees heading to Europe who had already arrived in Greece and Italy. Many countries <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/povinne-kvoty-pro-prijimani-uprchliku-odmita-rada-zemi-eu-tvrdi-cesko_201505191154_akottova\">had</a> reservations about mandatory quotas. However, the loudest opposition <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">came</a> from <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/mezinarodni-organizace-a-vs-visegradska-ctyrka.aspx\">the Visegrad Four</a> . The quotas <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">were</a> approved by EU interior ministers in September 2015. In December of the same year, Slovakia and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">filed</a> a lawsuit with the Court of Justice of the EU against the redistribution of asylum seekers based on quotas. In June 2017, for example, the Czech government <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vlada-cesko-uz-neprijme-zadneho-migranta-na-zaklade-kvot-zhorsila-se_1706051706_pj\">decided</a> that it would no longer accept any asylum seekers based on quotas, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">accepting</a> 12 of the 2,600 people allocated.</p><p> The European Commission then decided to open infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In September 2017, the relocation programme for applicants from Greece and Italy <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">ended</a> , with 29,144 people out of 160,000 being relocated and only five countries fulfilling their quotas. In April 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">had failed to fulfil</a> their obligations under European Union law.</p><p> On the contrary, in 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3173733-od-vety-zvladneme-uplynulo-pet-let-rozhodla-bych-se-stejne-tvrdi-merkelova\">took a</a> welcoming stance towards accepting refugees with her famous media statement &quot;we will <i>manage it</i> &quot;. At that time, Germany <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/migr_asyappctza/default/table?lang=en\">was</a> also the country with the highest number of asylum applications. However, Armin Laschet, the CDU candidate for chancellor in the September German elections, has now expressed the opposite. After the capture of Kabul, <a href=\"https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fluechtlinge-afghanistan-121.html\">he stated</a> that Germany &quot; <i>must not give the impression that we can accept every person in need</i> &quot;.</p><p> French President Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/evropsky-parlament/v-evrope-rostou-nove-ploty-unie-se-boji-uprchlicke-vlny-z-af/r~a5d8490204d511ec966d0cc47ab5f122/\">spoke</a> about the need to &quot; <i>defend against illegal migration</i> &quot; after the fall of Kabul. His predecessor, François Hollande, chose a different rhetoric in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-france/hollande-opens-french-doors-to-refugees-despite-opposition-idUKKCN0R70WC20150907\">saying he</a> would &quot; <i>get the crisis under control</i> &quot; and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/french-president-francois-hollande-welcomes-refugees-paris-attack/story?id=35274658\">defending</a> his decision to uphold his refugee admission commitments despite the terrorist attacks in Paris.</p><p> Six EU member states, including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/six-countries-urge-eu-not-stop-deportations-afghanistan-belgium-says-2021-08-10/\">sent</a> a letter to the European Commission in early August 2021 warning against halting deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers, despite the Taliban&#39;s advance in their homeland. However, Germany, along with another signatory of the letter, the Netherlands, subsequently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">announced</a> that they would not deport the unaccepted Afghans for the time being due to the development of the conflict. However, Austria <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">did not change</a> its position and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-austria-pm-wont-take-in-any-more-afghanistan-refugees-taliban/\">ruled out</a> accepting people fleeing Afghanistan, saying that this would not happen during his term in office.

It is therefore clear that the party did not meet this Fiala target in terms of the number of mandates in the municipal elections. However, even in these elections, the commitment was fulfilled in two of the three possible calculation methods (absolute number of votes and percentage of votes), therefore we evaluate the statement as a whole as true. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in municipal elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-jUB4F\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jUB4F/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"277\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
