    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>In the parliamentary elections in 2013, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">384,174</a> votes, and in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">572,948</a> , or 49% more. This number fits within our tolerance of 10% deviation. In percentage terms, it was 7.72% and 11.32% of the votes, respectively. At the same time, the party received 56.25% more seats ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">25</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">16</a> ). </p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-69s2T\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/69s2T/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"273\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20161007&amp;xv=2\">2016</a> Senate elections, the party won only two mandates, compared to 9 in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005\">2018.</a> In the 2018 elections, it also <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/volby/senat?k=2&amp;t=uspesnost-stran\">defended</a> only 4 mandates. So, ODS is also succeeding in fulfilling this goal in the Senate elections. Moreover, ODS won in the last Senate elections, as Petr Fiala further claims. In <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=2\">2018</a> , ODS candidates won a total of 9 mandates in 27 constituencies. Candidates for the second most successful party, STAN, won only 3 mandates.</p><p> In the European Parliament elections, the party has also managed to meet the 50% growth target, and even significantly exceeded it. In 2014, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> votes, and in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , an increase of 196%. At the same time, the party received almost double the percentage of votes in 2018 ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">14.54%</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">7.67%</a> in 2014). The number of seats won by ODS doubled from two in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> to four in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">the last</a> elections. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the European Parliament elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ebPAZ\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ebPAZ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"290\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the context of the European elections, the part about second place, doubling the number of mandates and tripling the number of votes is also true. In the last EP elections, ODS indeed finished <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep?xjazyk=CZ\">second</a> behind the ANO movement. In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> elections, the party won 2 mandates, while in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">this year&#39;s</a> elections it won 4. The number of votes from 2014 is <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> , and from 2019 it was <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , which is approximately 2.96 times more.</p><p> In the elections to city and municipal councils, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9,178,453 votes in 2014. In 2018, it <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 14,905,827 votes. The result thus exceeds the target set by Fiala by 1,138,147 votes. In percentage terms, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9.26% of the votes in 2014, and 13.56% in <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">the following</a> elections. It therefore received 0.33% less than the commitment assumes. However, the result fits within our 10% tolerance. The party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 2,398 mandates in 2014, which is 3.86%. In <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">2018</a> , it received 2,600, or 4.2%. It is therefore clear that the party did not meet this Fiala target in terms of the number of mandates in the municipal elections. However, even in these elections, the commitment was fulfilled in two of the three possible calculation methods (absolute number of votes and percentage of votes), therefore we evaluate the statement as a whole as true. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in municipal elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-jUB4F\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jUB4F/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"277\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p></p>\nSECTION B: <p>The European refugee crisis, as the wave of migration to Europe in 2015 and 2016 was called, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/czech-republic/news/migrace/migrace_historicky_prehled_cs\">began</a> in the spring of 2015 and was caused by the escalation of the <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3283818-krvavy-konflikt-v-syrii-vypukl-pred-deseti-lety-u-moci-zustava-oslabeny-basar-asad\">war</a> in Syria. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/48Cio/1/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-48Cio\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" title=\"Number of asylum applications to EU countries\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></figure><p> A dispute arose in the European Union over the redistribution of refugees heading to Europe who had already arrived in Greece and Italy. Many countries <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/povinne-kvoty-pro-prijimani-uprchliku-odmita-rada-zemi-eu-tvrdi-cesko_201505191154_akottova\">had</a> reservations about mandatory quotas. However, the loudest opposition <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">came</a> from <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/mezinarodni-organizace-a-vs-visegradska-ctyrka.aspx\">the Visegrad Four</a> . The quotas <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">were</a> approved by EU interior ministers in September 2015. In December of the same year, Slovakia and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">filed</a> a lawsuit with the Court of Justice of the EU against the redistribution of asylum seekers based on quotas. In June 2017, for example, the Czech government <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vlada-cesko-uz-neprijme-zadneho-migranta-na-zaklade-kvot-zhorsila-se_1706051706_pj\">decided</a> that it would no longer accept any asylum seekers based on quotas, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">accepting</a> 12 of the 2,600 people allocated.</p><p> The European Commission then decided to open infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In September 2017, the relocation programme for applicants from Greece and Italy <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">ended</a> , with 29,144 people out of 160,000 being relocated and only five countries fulfilling their quotas. In April 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">had failed to fulfil</a> their obligations under European Union law.</p><p> On the contrary, in 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3173733-od-vety-zvladneme-uplynulo-pet-let-rozhodla-bych-se-stejne-tvrdi-merkelova\">took a</a> welcoming stance towards accepting refugees with her famous media statement &quot;we will <i>manage it</i> &quot;. At that time, Germany <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/migr_asyappctza/default/table?lang=en\">was</a> also the country with the highest number of asylum applications. However, Armin Laschet, the CDU candidate for chancellor in the September German elections, has now expressed the opposite. After the capture of Kabul, <a href=\"https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fluechtlinge-afghanistan-121.html\">he stated</a> that Germany &quot; <i>must not give the impression that we can accept every person in need</i> &quot;.</p><p> French President Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/evropsky-parlament/v-evrope-rostou-nove-ploty-unie-se-boji-uprchlicke-vlny-z-af/r~a5d8490204d511ec966d0cc47ab5f122/\">spoke</a> about the need to &quot; <i>defend against illegal migration</i> &quot; after the fall of Kabul. His predecessor, François Hollande, chose a different rhetoric in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-france/hollande-opens-french-doors-to-refugees-despite-opposition-idUKKCN0R70WC20150907\">saying he</a> would &quot; <i>get the crisis under control</i> &quot; and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/french-president-francois-hollande-welcomes-refugees-paris-attack/story?id=35274658\">defending</a> his decision to uphold his refugee admission commitments despite the terrorist attacks in Paris.</p><p> Six EU member states, including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/six-countries-urge-eu-not-stop-deportations-afghanistan-belgium-says-2021-08-10/\">sent</a> a letter to the European Commission in early August 2021 warning against halting deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers, despite the Taliban&#39;s advance in their homeland. However, Germany, along with another signatory of the letter, the Netherlands, subsequently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">announced</a> that they would not deport the unaccepted Afghans for the time being due to the development of the conflict. However, Austria <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">did not change</a> its position and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-austria-pm-wont-take-in-any-more-afghanistan-refugees-taliban/\">ruled out</a> accepting people fleeing Afghanistan, saying that this would not happen during his term in office. The Greek Minister for Migration, whose country <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/grafika-reseni-migracni-krize/r~1a7e43b8e45911e59e52002590604f2e/\">faced</a> a strong influx of migrants due to its position during the last crisis and is another signatory of the letter, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">said</a> that &quot; <i>the EU is not prepared and does not have the capacity to handle another major migration crisis</i> &quot;.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Petr Fiala answered <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030501017/#t=48m28s\">a question</a> in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions (video, time 48:28) that mentioned that more than a million voters lost their votes in the parliamentary elections, and are therefore not represented in the Chamber of Deputies. Petr Fiala stated (time 49:22) that <i>&quot;good government governs for everyone, even for those who did not vote for it&quot;</i> . He then illustrates this position by referring to his older statement from the election staff, which is the content of the verified statement.</p><p> Petr Fiala, in the SPOLU coalition&#39;s election staff, gave his first post-election speech on October 9, when <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3383514-zmeny-je-tady-my-jsme-ji-slibili-my-ji-udelame-rekl-lidr-spolu-fiala\">he said</a> (video, time 1:52): <i>&quot;(…) I would like to ask you something in this context. All of you who are watching us. It doesn&#39;t matter who you voted for, it doesn&#39;t matter what your political preferences are. First and foremost, we are all citizens of the Czech Republic who want to live here and we want to live here together, as neighbors, as friends, as colleagues. That is what unites us all.&quot;</i></p><p> Let us add that the SPOLU coalition <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps124?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xkraj=0&amp;xstrana=13&amp;xv=1\">, consisting of</a> ODS, TOP 09 and KDU-ČSL, won <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">27.79%</a> of the votes in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, finishing first.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>First of all, let us state that the part of the statement where Petr Fiala states that it was not easy for ODS not to field its candidate in every district is an opinion statement, and therefore we will not evaluate it as such.</p><p> ODS can be considered a traditional political party on the Czech scene (it was <a href=\"https://aplikace.mvcr.cz/seznam-politickych-stran/Vypis_Rejstrik.aspx?id=120\">founded</a> in 1991). The part of the statement regarding the 2018 Senate elections can also be considered completely true. New senators were elected in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=7&amp;xt=1\">27</a> districts and ODS nominated its representative in only<a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xobvod=0&amp;xv=1\">17</a> of them.</p><p> In other districts, ODS nominated a coalition candidate together with other parties. Such candidates included <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=44\">Jan Tecl</a> , who was nominated by ODS together with STAN, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=68\">Pavel Herbert</a> , a joint candidate of TOP 09, ODS and STAN, and <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se2111?XJAZYK=CZ&amp;XDATUM=20181005&amp;xobvod=59\">Mikuláš Bek</a> .</p><p> Furthermore, ODS <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ods-volby-senat-obcanska-demokraticka-strana-cervicek-bek-fischer-kratina_1805261709_haf\">supported,</a> for example, the candidacies of Pavel Fischer in Prague, Hana Žáková in Třebíč, and Lukáš Libor in Zlín.

On December 14, 2021, the Chamber of Deputies <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2021ps/stenprot/004schuz/bqbs/b02100901.htm\">voted</a> on <i>the Resolution of the Parliament on the necessary role of nuclear energy in the decarbonization of the economy</i> . This is <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=15300\">a resolution</a> according to which the Chamber of Deputies:</p><ul><li> notes that the Czech Republic has committed to the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal,</li><li> appreciates that the EU recognises the right of Member States to freely choose the composition of their energy mix,</li><li> stresses that the Czech Republic, due to its geographical conditions, is unable to meet its obligations without the use of nuclear energy,</li><li> recalls that the important role of nuclear energy was also confirmed by the President of the European Commission,</li><li> therefore notes that nuclear energy must be fully recognised as part of the solution for decarbonising the economy. It cannot be seen as just a &quot;transitional&quot; category, but as a tool that &quot;enables&quot; the low-carbon transformation of the economy and makes it economically and socially sustainable in the long term. The criteria for the sustainability of the low-carbon transformation of the economy should be technologically neutral and must not differentiate between generations of nuclear installations or reactor technology,</li><li> also notes that the Czech Republic intends to temporarily use natural gas in its mix,</li><li> Calls on the EU to include gas as a transitional source and nuclear energy as a sustainable source,</li><li> instructs Andrej Babiš, the outgoing Prime Minister, to present this opinion to the European Council at its meeting on 15 December 2021.</li></ul><p> The majority of deputies, with the exception of SPD representatives, voted <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=77438&amp;l=cz\">in favor of</a> this proposal. The Senate also <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/senat-ve-shode-se-snemovnou-podporil-vyuzivani-jaderne-energie/2133449\">supported</a> the Chamber of Deputies&#39; resolution the following day.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>Alena Schillerová <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/statni-zamestnanci-platy-za-rok-2020-vzrust-prumerneho-platu_2105150933_kuc\">spoke</a> about freezing the salaries of civil servants in the spring of 2021. According to the former Minister of Finance, salaries should only <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/v-mediich/2021/schillerova-vyvoj-pandemie-rozhodne-o-no-41240\">be increased</a> for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers as part of the consolidation of public finances. Although <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/schillerova-chci-obnovit-eet-40358028\">she stated</a> several times in <a href=\"https://cnn.iprima.cz/pojdme-rusit-danove-vyjimky-vyzvala-alena-schillerova-dane-pry-zvysovat-nechce-23442\">April</a> that she did not want to reduce the salaries of firefighters and police officers, she did not talk about increasing their salaries.</p><p> Let us also add that in <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3326254-odbory-kritizuji-plan-na-zmrazeni-platu-statnich-zamestnancu-schillerova-na-nem\">June 2021</a> , the government of Andrej Babiš approved a draft state budget, which envisaged that the salary freeze would apply not only to civil servants, but also to police officers, firefighters and soldiers. The only exception was to be teachers&#39; salaries. Alena Schillerová stated at the time that the government could not afford to increase the salaries of civil servants due to the high state budget deficit.</p><p> The then Minister of the Interior, Hamáček, <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/hamacek-rakusan-fiala-rozpocet-bis.A210829_120337_domaci_vlc\">had</a> long opposed freezing the salaries of police officers and firefighters, and on the contrary, proposed a 3.5% increase in salaries for these groups.</p><p> However, former Minister Schillerová finally reversed course in September 2021 and <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/platy-statnich-zamestnancu-nakonec-vzrostou-potvrdila-poprve-schillerova-40372366\">agreed</a> to increase the salaries of all civil servants, including firefighters and police officers, although debates continued over the rate of increase. The ČSSD opposed a percentage increase and proposed a fixed monetary amount. In mid- <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3398176-zive-vlada-k-mimoradne-pomoci-kvuli-zdrazovani-energii\">November</a> , Andrej Babiš&#39;s government finally approved a blanket <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/od-ledna-se-zvysi-platy-ve-statnim-a-verejnem-sektoru-o-1-400-korun--rozhodla-vlada-191806/\">increase in civil servants&#39; salaries</a> by more than a thousand crowns, starting in January 2022.</p><p> On December 29, 2021, the government of Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/vlada-prida-socialnim-pracovnikum-zdravotnikum-a-ucitelum/2138652\">approved</a> a salary increase for only some civil servants. The new government had previously announced that it did not agree with a blanket increase. The salaries of social service workers are to increase by 700 crowns from January 2022, the salaries of healthcare workers by 6% and teachers by 2%. The government also approved an increase in the salaries of soldiers, firefighters and police officers by 700 crowns. The government of Petr Fiala decided to freeze the salaries of civil servants in ministries and other offices from January.</p><p> In the spring of last year, Alena Schillerová publicly declared that she wanted to save on the salaries of civil servants as part of the consolidation. She wanted to increase salaries only for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers. In September, she proposed increasing salaries for all civil servants. However, neither position corresponds to the move by the Fiala government. The government increased salaries for more groups of employees than Alena Schillerová proposed in the spring, but at the same time, the new cabinet increased salaries by less than the then minister had planned in September.</p><p> Petr Fiala thus incorrectly states that his government did exactly what Alena Schillerová proposed. Moreover, the Prime Minister points out the former minister&#39;s alleged hypocrisy by drawing attention to her relatively restrictive stance from the spring, but neglecting her more budgetary-relaxed position from September 2021.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
