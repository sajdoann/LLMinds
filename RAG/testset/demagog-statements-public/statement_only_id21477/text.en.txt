I would like to recall the statements of the former Minister of Finance, Mrs. Schillerov√°, from the spring of last year, when she said that the path to budget consolidation lies, among other things, in not valorizing, not increasing the salaries of employees in the state sector. And that only the salaries of teachers, firefighters, police officers, and so on will increase. And that is exactly what we did.
