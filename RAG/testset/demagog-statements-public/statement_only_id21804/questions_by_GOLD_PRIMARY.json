    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>In his statement, Minister Jurečka describes the mechanism of extraordinary pension valorization, which, according to the <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155\">Pension Insurance</a> Act, will be used in the event of rapidly <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3400504-cesko-smeruje-k-mimoradnemu-zvysovani-duchodu-kvuli-inflaci\">increasing</a> inflation.</p><p> The conditions for increasing pensions in an extraordinary period are specifically described <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-3\">in Section 67.</a> According to it, an extraordinary valorization of pensions is applied if the growth of the <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-1\">consumer</a> price index has reached at least 5%. The merit part of the pension (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/429119-zvyseni-duchodu-je-definitivni-spocitejte-si-kolik-dostanete\">the percentage assessment</a> of the pension) is then <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3400504-cesko-smeruje-k-mimoradnemu-zvysovani-duchodu-kvuli-inflaci\">increased</a> by the same percentage as the price increase.</p><p> The period for determining price increases always begins with the calendar month following the end of the period according to which pensions were last valorized. In the case of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-4-a\">a regular valorization date,</a> price increases are monitored until the end of June of the previous year (in the case of a regular date in 2022, this would be the end of June 2021). However, in the case of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-4-b\">an extraordinary valorization</a> , the assessed period is shortened and ends with the month &quot; <i>in which price increases reached at least 5%.</i> Let us specify that these 5% must be the sum of <i>&quot;month-on-month</i> <i>inflation</i> <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/430759-dalsi-zvyseni-duchodu-mimoradna-valorizace-kvuli-inflaci\"><i>increases</i></a> &quot; for the given period.</p><p> Pensions are increased on a regular basis from <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-2\">January 1.</a> The last increase took place <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/finance/vice-penez-do-kapes-duchodcu-i-zamestnancu-letosni-rok-je-fi/r~c15e50f06c8f11ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/\">on January 1,</a> 2022, based on the increase in the consumer price index by the end <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">of June 2021</a> (.pdf). The last month <i>&quot;taken into account for pension valorization&quot;</i> was June, not July, which Marian Jurečka mentions in his statement. However, let us note that the period for determining price increases for further pension increases begins in July 2021.</p><p> The whole issue is also explained in a press release ( <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">.pdf</a> ) of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs from November 18, 2021. According to this report, pensions must be increased by a government decree if the above conditions are met. The government must issue this within <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-16\">50 days</a> of the end of the month in which prices increased by at least 5%. If the estimates come true, according to the ministry, the pension increase should take place in <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">June 2022</a> (.pdf).</p><p> In January, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/media-a-verejnost\">, Eva Davidová</a> , also <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/mimoradna-valorizace-penzi-snizi-tu-radnou-40384069\">commented</a> on the extraordinary valorization of pensions for the daily Právo: &quot; <i>We assume that there will be such a price increase in January that the cumulated inflation from July 2021 will exceed five percent and that the valorization will be carried out in an extraordinary period, which will include the entire price development until January 2022.&quot;</i> She also <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/mimoradna-valorizace-penzi-snizi-tu-radnou-40384069\">added</a> that the regular valorization of pensions in 2023 will be lower than if the extraordinary valorization had not occurred, but overall, both pension increases will reflect the overall price development.</p><p> As for the overall growth of the consumer price <a href=\"https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/cs/shortUrl?su=e730f7c1\">index</a> , from July to November 2021, this value increased by <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/430759-dalsi-zvyseni-duchodu-mimoradna-valorizace-kvuli-inflaci\">3.1%</a> . In December, there was a month-on-month increase of <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/indexy-spotrebitelskych-cen-inflace-prosinec-2021\">0.4%</a> , bringing the total number to 3.5%. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is therefore likely counting on an even faster increase of at least 1.5% in January, to a total of 5%.</p><p> Let us add that the Ministry of Finance, in its January macroeconomic prediction, <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2022/ekonomika-letos-poroste-o-31--prumerna-i-44286\">expects</a> a relatively sharp increase in the average inflation rate to 8.5% in 2022. According to information from the Czech Statistical Office, in 2021 it was <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/indexy-spotrebitelskych-cen-inflace-prosinec-2021\">3.8%</a> .</p><p> Given that Marian Jurečka describes the applicable rules for extraordinary valorization correctly, apart from a minor time inaccuracy, we assess this statement as true.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Marian Jurečka, together with a group of deputies elected for the KDU-ČSL, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=439\">submitted</a> <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?O=8&amp;CT=439&amp;CT1=0\">a proposal</a> (.pdf) for an amendment to the Pension Insurance Act on March 29, 2019. The explanatory report contains a total of 12 proposals, of which 10 proposals concern widow&#39;s pensions, students and mothers&#39; compensation.</p><p> The proposals regarding widows&#39; pensions are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to ease the requirements for the deceased spouse&#39;s insurance period by 5 years for entitlement to an old-age pension as a condition for obtaining entitlement to a widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pension.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the minimum period of receiving widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions from 1 year to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to bring the threshold before retirement age for permanent receipt of widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions closer - from 4 to 8 years before reaching retirement age.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the period after the end of entitlements, after which a widow&#39;s pension can be granted again if the conditions for entitlement arise again, from 2 years to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to increase the percentage assessment for widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions, from the current 50% to 80% of the percentage assessment of the pension to which the spouse was or would have been entitled at the time of death.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed that if the conditions for entitlement to payment of disability and widow&#39;s or widower&#39;s pension are simultaneously met, the percentage assessment of both pensions is paid in full and half of the percentage assessment is paid from the other pensions, unless the amount pursuant to paragraph 1 is higher.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> For students, it is <em>&quot;proposed that university studies be counted as a substitute insurance period even after December 31, 1995.&quot;</em></p><p> The proposals for compensating mothers are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;In order to quickly partially correct the unfairly low pensions of mothers (or fathers in a substitute role) who contributed to the pension system by caring for and raising children, [it is] proposed to increase the percentage assessment of the old-age pension by CZK 500 per month for each child raised.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to reduce the mandatory insurance period to 10 years for obtaining a pension entitlement after reaching retirement age</em> . <em>&quot;</em> According to the explanatory memorandum, this may apply, for example, to mothers of multiple children who lack a replacement insurance period.</li><li> <em>&quot;Furthermore, it is proposed to allow mothers (and in similar cases fathers who took care of the children instead of the mother) to retire earlier before reaching retirement age, by one year for each child raised, and at the same time without any current sanctions.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> According to the former chairman of the KDU-ČSL, Marek Výborný, the cost of adding 500 crowns for each child raised would <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66548830-vyssi-duchody-pro-zeny-ktere-vychovaly-deti-politici-jsou-pro-ale-nachazeji-nejruznejsi-ale\">reach</a> 16 billion crowns per year. The same amount is also stated <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?O=8&amp;CT=439&amp;CT1=0\">in the explanatory report</a> (.pdf, p. 8). Given that Marian Jurečka incorrectly calculated the budgetary impact of increasing the pension assessment by 500 CZK, we assess the statement as false.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Following its meeting on April 27, 2022, the government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-prodiskutovala-tzv--balicek-rodinne-pomoci--schvalila-i-pomoc-socialnim-sluzbam-s-pokrytim-zvysenych-nakladu-na-peci-o-uprchliky-195891/\">announced</a> a set of measures at a press conference to help families with children cope with high inflation and rising energy prices. The specific assistance consists of <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2786931/TZ_28_04_2022_P%C5%99%C3%ADsp%C4%9Bvek+5000+na+d%C3%ADt%C4%9B_.pdf/5d6f06f2-a50e-56bd-8a40-82bdbb388df3\">paying</a> (.pdf) a one-time contribution of 5 thousand crowns per child to all families with an annual income of up to one million crowns.</p><p> At a press conference, CNN Prima News editor Dáša Šamanová <a href=\"https://livestream.com/accounts/17590784/events/10363010/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=false&amp;defaultDrawer=&amp;autoPlay=true&amp;mute=false\">asked</a> (video, time 30:11) Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka whether the contribution is calculated from gross or net annual income. While asking the question, he leaned over (time 30:31) to Prime Minister Petr Fial and apparently asked him something. Petr Fiala responded by shrugging his shoulders and smiling.</p><p> Marian Jurečka <a href=\"https://livestream.com/accounts/17590784/events/10363010/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=false&amp;defaultDrawer=&amp;autoPlay=false&amp;mute=false\">answered</a> the question (video, time 32:00): <i>&quot;If I&#39;m not mistaken, in the debate we had about that parameter, we were talking about the net income of that household.&quot;</i> </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://livestream.com/accounts/17590784/events/10363010/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=true&amp;autoPlay=true&amp;mute=false\" id=\"ls_embed_1652708445\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></figure><p> He later corrected this original information on April 30, 2022, <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/jurecka-prispevek-5000-kc-na-dite-bude-do-rocniho-prijmu-rodiny-1-milion-kc-hrubeho/2199681\">saying</a> that it would be a threshold of CZK 1 million gross. He posted the change on his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MJureka/status/1520357253827776512?s=20&amp;t=Wytt1W60ui7qIWzbyyx_xQ\">Twitter account</a> , where he apologized for the inaccuracy.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>The former government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-schvalila-podpurne-programy-pro-podnikatele-postizene-protiepidemickymi-opatrenimi-192462/\">introduced</a> several programs to help employees, businesses, and the self-employed (SVČ) during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p> As for the current <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace\">compensation</a> programs, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/informace-o-koronavirus/covid-dotacni-rozcestnik--259263/\">includes</a> , for example, <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/antivirus-nucene-omezeni-provozu-karanteny\">the Antivirus A</a> and <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/antivirus-b\">Antivirus B</a> programs. The purpose of the first of these is <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-koronaviru/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/\">to compensate</a> employers whose employees were ordered to quarantine or isolate. Antivirus B was to <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-koronaviru/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/\">compensate</a> companies if they had to limit operations due to a significant number of employees in quarantine, or, for example, if demand for their services or products is limited due to the pandemic.</p><p> For injured self-employed persons, but also for partners of small companies and people working on the DPČ and DPP, there is a <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2021/od-22-listopadu-bude-pokracovat-kompenza-43629\">Compensation Bonus</a> program, which <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/informace-o-koronavirus/covid-dotacni-rozcestnik--259263/\">falls</a> under the Ministry of Finance.</p><p> For <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/covid-2021\">example,</a> the Ministry of Industry and Trade was supposed to be responsible for <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-2021\">the COVID 2021</a> subsidy program and the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-nepokryte-naklady\">COVID Uncovered Costs</a> program, <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/nova-podoba-kompenzaci-k-programu-na-nepokryte-naklady-vlada-schvalila-take-program-covid---2021-s-podporou-500-kc-za-den-a-zamestnance---259983/\">intended</a> for companies with a significant drop in sales. Although they were already prepared, the government ultimately decided <a href=\"https://www.podnikatel.cz/aktuality/firmy-maji-smulu-novy-ministr-odmitl-programy-covid-2021-a-nepokryte-naklady/\">not to</a> relaunch them.</p><p> Let us add that there are currently some programs whose purpose is primarily to provide entrepreneurs with loan <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace\">guarantees</a> , but these are not classic compensations. We can mention, for example, the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/zaruka-covid-sport\">COVID Sport</a> guarantee program under the Ministry of Industry and Trade. It also managed the recently completed <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-zaruka-ck-prijem-zadosti-ukoncen\">COVID Travel Agency</a> Guarantee program for travel agencies, which was followed by <a href=\"https://www.nrb.cz/zaruky-cestovnim-kancelarim-bude-nrb-poskytovat-i-v-roce-2022/\">the Travel Agency Guarantee</a> program of the Ministry for Regional Development.</p><p> The above information shows that compensation programs are indeed divided primarily between the three mentioned ministries. We therefore assess Marian Jurečka&#39;s statement as true.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
