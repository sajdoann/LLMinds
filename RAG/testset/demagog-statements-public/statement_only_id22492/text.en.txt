That project (modification of the government&#39;s powers when sending soldiers abroad, note: Demagog.cz) comes from our government and clearly states: if terrorists capture our people (...), we will send our anti-terrorist commando there, and no one will know about it, yes, but I fundamentally disagree with the government deciding without Parliament whether foreign soldiers will be here or whether we will send soldiers somewhere else.
