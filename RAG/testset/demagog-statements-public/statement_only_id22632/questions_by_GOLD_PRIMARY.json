Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p><strong>Context</strong></p><p> Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka is talking about a possible decision by the Constitutional Court (ÚS) regarding the newly adopted reduction in pension valorization in June 2023. The ANO movement is currently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqIebm42vdI\">working</a> (video) on a complaint (or <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p64-1\">a proposal</a> to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl87-1-a\">repeal</a> the law) with which it wants to challenge the amendment to the Pension Valorization Act. The SPD movement also wants <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572040-na-ustavni-soud-se-opozice-obrati-jakmile-zmena-valorizace-duchodu-vyjde-ve-sbirce\">to join</a> the submission.</p><p> Let us mention that due to the newly adopted amendment to the law, which was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu\">signed by</a> President Petr Pavel, during the extraordinary valorization of pensions in June, pensions <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">will increase</a> on average by only CZK 760 ( <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/\">.doc</a> , p. 1). According to the previously valid <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22604\">rules</a> , the average pension should have increased by <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/starobni-duchod/439182-zvyseni-duchodu-v-cervnu-spocitejte-si-rozdil-valorizace\">CZK 1,770</a> . According to <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-schvalila-upravene-parametry-valorizace-duchodu--prumerny-starobni-duchodce-dostane-o-760-korun-vice-203160/\">the government</a> , the change is necessary because without the adjustments, the “ <i>public finance deficit would have increased by more than CZK 34 billion”</i> this year. The government now expects that pension spending will increase by only CZK 15 billion ( <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/\">.doc</a> , p. 5–6).</p><p> The opposition <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu\">cites</a> several reasons for submitting the proposal to the Constitutional Court. The first is the so-called <a href=\"https://cit.vfu.cz/ppoz/okruhypdf/1pravnipredpisyzakladnipojmyadruhypravnichpredpisu.pdf\">retroactivity</a> (.pdf, pp. 2–3), or retroactive effect. The opposition movement <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">claims</a> that in the case of the amendment, the change in the legal regulation was approved only after the valorization <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-3\">mechanism</a> was launched. &quot; <i>We believe that it was created on January 31,&quot;</i> Alena Schillerová <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">justifies</a> retroactivity as one of the pillars of the prepared proposal, because the amendment only entered into <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">force</a> after the aforementioned date, specifically March 20, 2023.</p><p> The second reason for submitting a motion to repeal the amendment <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">is</a> the state of legislative emergency declared by the government, due to which the submitted government proposal <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=314\">is being discussed</a> in an abbreviated session. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#f1609384\">Act</a> No. 90/1995 Coll., on the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies, such a state can <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#p99-1\">be declared</a> in an extraordinary moment &quot; <i>when the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens or the security of the state are fundamentally threatened or when the state is threatened with significant economic damage</i> &quot;. The opposition wants to refute the government&#39;s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230403130212/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2329976\">argument</a> that the state of legislative emergency was declared precisely because of the risk of &quot;major economic damage&quot;, as it <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">believes</a> that this was unjustified.</p><p> Opposition parties <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">can</a> submit a proposal from March 20, when the amendment <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">was published</a> in <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392\">the Collection of Laws</a> . According to the chairwoman of the ANO parliamentary group, Alena Schillerová, the proposal could <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">reach</a> the Constitutional Court in early May. The movement&#39;s deputy chairman, Radek Vondráček, <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">said</a> on March 19 that this could happen within a month.</p><p> After considering the proposal, the Constitutional Court then <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p70-1\">decides</a> whether the law or its individual provisions are in conflict with the Constitution. If the constitutional order has been violated, the court may annul the law in question (in this case, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392\">the amendment</a> to the Act on Lower Pension Valorization) and order the relevant state body to restore the situation prior to the violation of the Constitution. However, in the past, although the Constitutional Court did not consider a decision to be unconstitutional, it published <i>an obiter dictum</i> , which is <a href=\"https://www.ceska-justice.cz/2020/04/praha-7-ustavni-stiznost-kvuli-koronavirovym-opatrenim-nestahne-jde-nam-judikat-budoucna-tvrdi-starosta-i-pravnici/\">a non-authoritative</a> statement beyond the basic reasoning ( <a href=\"https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 11).</p><p> <strong>Finding to declare a state of emergency</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka mentions the case law when the Constitutional Court found doubts about the method of extending the state of emergency. This <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ustavni-soud-zamitl-zadost-senatoru-unor-nouzovy-stav_2103251028_btk\">happened,</a> for example, in March 2021. At that time, the Constitutional Court was considering a proposal by a group of senators to annul the resolution <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2018-cr/andrej-babis-ii/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-27-6-2018-trva-175411/\">of the government of</a> Andrej Babiš (ANO) due to the declaration of a state of emergency at the request of the governors, which occurred immediately after the proposal to extend the previous state of emergency was not passed<a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koronavirus-v-cesku-nouzovy-stav-senat_2102171308_pj\">by the Chamber of Deputies</a> .</p><p> The Constitutional Court rejected the proposal ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 1) stating that it was not within its competence to decide on such a proposal (.pdf, p. 7. 12). However, as <i>an obiter dictum</i> , it stated ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 7) that &quot; <i>a state of emergency cannot be &#39;newly&#39; declared by the government from the moment the &#39;authorized&#39; state of emergency has ended and the Chamber of Deputies has not agreed to its extension</i> &quot;. As part of <i>the obiter dictum</i> , the Constitutional Court can therefore submit a non-binding statement ( <a href=\"https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 11) or a recommendation for the legislative process.</p><p> Let us add that in the debate with Minister Jurečka, the moderator asked about option B in the event that the Constitutional Court &quot;swept away&quot; the amendment, that is, if it recognized it as unconstitutional, and thus ordered the government to restore the status quo before the violation of the constitutional system. In such a case, the situation described by Marian Jurečka, that the Constitutional Court would <i>not &quot;change the essence&quot;</i> of the amendment, would not occur. Since the decisions of the Constitutional Court are <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/postaveni-a-pravomoci\">binding</a> , <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">the amended</a> law would have to return to its original form.</p><p> <strong>Finding on the amendment to the pandemic law</strong></p><p> In 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf\">.pdf</a> ) in a similar case, where a group of deputies led by Radek Vondráček (ANO) challenged <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=127\">the use of</a> a state of legislative emergency to discuss <a href=\"http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2022-39\">an amendment to</a> the pandemic law (Law No. 39/2022 Coll.) at the beginning of 2022. In September 2022, the Constitutional Court rejected the proposal of the opposition deputies ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 1), but in its ruling it stated (p. 24) that <i>&quot;the process leading to the adoption of Law No. 39/2022 Coll. cannot be considered - at a sub-constitutional level - to be flawless&quot;</i> and noted in passing that <i>&quot;the legislative process under review and its course can be considered a reflection of the current political culture, the state of which is characterized, among other things, by numerous obstructionist negotiations, the chaotic agenda and course of meetings, as well as the inflexibility of the legislative process&quot;.</i></p><p> <strong>Final evaluation</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka truthfully states that in the past, when rejecting proposals to repeal a law, the Constitutional Court used non-binding statements, so-called obiter dictums, in which it found, for example, doubts in the legislative process. For this reason, we assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Following its meeting on April 27, 2022, the government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-prodiskutovala-tzv--balicek-rodinne-pomoci--schvalila-i-pomoc-socialnim-sluzbam-s-pokrytim-zvysenych-nakladu-na-peci-o-uprchliky-195891/\">announced</a> a set of measures at a press conference to help families with children cope with high inflation and rising energy prices. The specific assistance consists of <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2786931/TZ_28_04_2022_P%C5%99%C3%ADsp%C4%9Bvek+5000+na+d%C3%ADt%C4%9B_.pdf/5d6f06f2-a50e-56bd-8a40-82bdbb388df3\">paying</a> (.pdf) a one-time contribution of 5 thousand crowns per child to all families with an annual income of up to one million crowns.</p><p> At a press conference, CNN Prima News editor Dáša Šamanová <a href=\"https://livestream.com/accounts/17590784/events/10363010/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=false&amp;defaultDrawer=&amp;autoPlay=true&amp;mute=false\">asked</a> (video, time 30:11) Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka whether the contribution is calculated from gross or net annual income. While asking the question, he leaned over (time 30:31) to Prime Minister Petr Fial and apparently asked him something. Petr Fiala responded by shrugging his shoulders and smiling.</p><p> Marian Jurečka <a href=\"https://livestream.com/accounts/17590784/events/10363010/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=false&amp;defaultDrawer=&amp;autoPlay=false&amp;mute=false\">answered</a> the question (video, time 32:00): <i>&quot;If I&#39;m not mistaken, in the debate we had about that parameter, we were talking about the net income of that household.&quot;</i> </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://livestream.com/accounts/17590784/events/10363010/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=true&amp;autoPlay=true&amp;mute=false\" id=\"ls_embed_1652708445\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></figure><p> He later corrected this original information on April 30, 2022, <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/jurecka-prispevek-5000-kc-na-dite-bude-do-rocniho-prijmu-rodiny-1-milion-kc-hrubeho/2199681\">saying</a> that it would be a threshold of CZK 1 million gross. He posted the change on his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MJureka/status/1520357253827776512?s=20&amp;t=Wytt1W60ui7qIWzbyyx_xQ\">Twitter account</a> , where he apologized for the inaccuracy.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>The former government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-schvalila-podpurne-programy-pro-podnikatele-postizene-protiepidemickymi-opatrenimi-192462/\">introduced</a> several programs to help employees, businesses, and the self-employed (SVČ) during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p> As for the current <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace\">compensation</a> programs, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/informace-o-koronavirus/covid-dotacni-rozcestnik--259263/\">includes</a> , for example, <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/antivirus-nucene-omezeni-provozu-karanteny\">the Antivirus A</a> and <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/antivirus-b\">Antivirus B</a> programs. The purpose of the first of these is <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-koronaviru/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/\">to compensate</a> employers whose employees were ordered to quarantine or isolate. Antivirus B was to <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-koronaviru/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/\">compensate</a> companies if they had to limit operations due to a significant number of employees in quarantine, or, for example, if demand for their services or products is limited due to the pandemic.</p><p> For injured self-employed persons, but also for partners of small companies and people working on the DPČ and DPP, there is a <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2021/od-22-listopadu-bude-pokracovat-kompenza-43629\">Compensation Bonus</a> program, which <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/informace-o-koronavirus/covid-dotacni-rozcestnik--259263/\">falls</a> under the Ministry of Finance.</p><p> For <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/covid-2021\">example,</a> the Ministry of Industry and Trade was supposed to be responsible for <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-2021\">the COVID 2021</a> subsidy program and the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-nepokryte-naklady\">COVID Uncovered Costs</a> program, <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/nova-podoba-kompenzaci-k-programu-na-nepokryte-naklady-vlada-schvalila-take-program-covid---2021-s-podporou-500-kc-za-den-a-zamestnance---259983/\">intended</a> for companies with a significant drop in sales. Although they were already prepared, the government ultimately decided <a href=\"https://www.podnikatel.cz/aktuality/firmy-maji-smulu-novy-ministr-odmitl-programy-covid-2021-a-nepokryte-naklady/\">not to</a> relaunch them.</p><p> Let us add that there are currently some programs whose purpose is primarily to provide entrepreneurs with loan <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace\">guarantees</a> , but these are not classic compensations. We can mention, for example, the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/zaruka-covid-sport\">COVID Sport</a> guarantee program under the Ministry of Industry and Trade. It also managed the recently completed <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-zaruka-ck-prijem-zadosti-ukoncen\">COVID Travel Agency</a> Guarantee program for travel agencies, which was followed by <a href=\"https://www.nrb.cz/zaruky-cestovnim-kancelarim-bude-nrb-poskytovat-i-v-roce-2022/\">the Travel Agency Guarantee</a> program of the Ministry for Regional Development.</p><p> The above information shows that compensation programs are indeed divided primarily between the three mentioned ministries. We therefore assess Marian Jurečka&#39;s statement as true.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Marian Jurečka, together with a group of deputies elected for the KDU-ČSL, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=439\">submitted</a> <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?O=8&amp;CT=439&amp;CT1=0\">a proposal</a> (.pdf) for an amendment to the Pension Insurance Act on March 29, 2019. The explanatory report contains a total of 12 proposals, of which 10 proposals concern widow&#39;s pensions, students and mothers&#39; compensation.</p><p> The proposals regarding widows&#39; pensions are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to ease the requirements for the deceased spouse&#39;s insurance period by 5 years for entitlement to an old-age pension as a condition for obtaining entitlement to a widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pension.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the minimum period of receiving widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions from 1 year to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to bring the threshold before retirement age for permanent receipt of widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions closer - from 4 to 8 years before reaching retirement age.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the period after the end of entitlements, after which a widow&#39;s pension can be granted again if the conditions for entitlement arise again, from 2 years to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to increase the percentage assessment for widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions, from the current 50% to 80% of the percentage assessment of the pension to which the spouse was or would have been entitled at the time of death.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed that if the conditions for entitlement to payment of disability and widow&#39;s or widower&#39;s pension are simultaneously met, the percentage assessment of both pensions is paid in full and half of the percentage assessment is paid from the other pensions, unless the amount pursuant to paragraph 1 is higher.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> For students, it is <em>&quot;proposed that university studies be counted as a substitute insurance period even after December 31, 1995.&quot;</em></p><p> The proposals for compensating mothers are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;In order to quickly partially correct the unfairly low pensions of mothers (or fathers in a substitute role) who contributed to the pension system by caring for and raising children, [it is] proposed to increase the percentage assessment of the old-age pension by CZK 500 per month for each child raised.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to reduce the mandatory insurance period to 10 years for obtaining a pension entitlement after reaching retirement age</em> . <em>&quot;</em> According to the explanatory memorandum, this may apply, for example, to mothers of multiple children who lack a replacement insurance period.</li><li> <em>&quot;Furthermore, it is proposed to allow mothers (and in similar cases fathers who took care of the children instead of the mother) to retire earlier before reaching retirement age, by one year for each child raised, and at the same time without any current sanctions.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> According to the former chairman of the KDU-ČSL, Marek Výborný, the cost of adding 500 crowns for each child raised would <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66548830-vyssi-duchody-pro-zeny-ktere-vychovaly-deti-politici-jsou-pro-ale-nachazeji-nejruznejsi-ale\">reach</a> 16 billion crowns per year. The same amount is also stated <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?O=8&amp;CT=439&amp;CT1=0\">in the explanatory report</a> (.pdf, p. 8). Given that Marian Jurečka incorrectly calculated the budgetary impact of increasing the pension assessment by 500 CZK, we assess the statement as false.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) is responding to criticism from ANO MP Klára Dostálová, who commented in the debate on the government&#39;s poor communication regarding the planned adjustment of the parameters for regular pension valorization. According to MP Dostálová, Marian Jurečka wants to submit this change too quickly, which is why there will be no time for thorough discussions with the opposition. The head of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs responded by saying that he is not going to submit the amendment in the near future, and noted that he has previously objected to such information.</p><p> <strong>Statement on the negotiations in the week of March 20-26</strong></p><p> First of all, let us mention that the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MLSA) Eva Davidová <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230327123710/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2340047\">told</a> ČTK on Friday, March 17, 2023, that the government could discuss the amendment that would amend the rules for pension valorization as early as the week of March 20-26. Eva Davidová also expressed the same opinion on <a href=\"https://cnn.iprima.cz/porady/zpravy/17032023-0\">CNN Prima News</a> (video, 13:54–15:00). Among other things, she stated that she expected the proposal to be <i>&quot;approved by the government during the next week&quot;</i> (video, 14:54).</p><p> Later that same day, however, Marian Jurečka <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-zmeny-valorizaci-penzi-nejsou-na-poradu-dne-jurecka-slibil-standardni-legislativni-proces-40426160\">announced</a> that Petr Fiala&#39;s cabinet <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572522-jurecka-chce-v-pristich-tydnech-jednat-o-zmene-valorizace-duchodu-s-opozici-i-odbory\">would not</a> discuss such a proposal in the aforementioned week. He specifically stated at a press conference ( <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mpsvcz/videos/615199293757846\">video</a> , 3:10): <i>&quot;I have started to negotiate with representatives of the opposition, in the coming days I will also negotiate (…) with colleagues from the SPD and also with representatives of unions and employers.

Let us add that Marian Jurečka also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3573198-jurecka-s-opozici-jedna-o-dalsim-zpomaleni-rustu-penzi-dohoda-je-ale-v-nedohlednu\">wants</a> to reduce the benefits of early retirement.</p><p> Marian Jurečka then <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-fiala-spd-po-jednani-s-jureckou-odmitame-snizeni-realnych-duchodu-40426514?fbclid=IwAR05IcQiNxPhTmXIzrFhjmPRUyeRj5nSNB6rbL5ivn8J5wiDUSOjS1V-aJM#source=hp&amp;seq_no=10&amp;dop_ab_variant=0&amp;dop_source_zone_name=novinky.sznhp.box&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_medium=z-boxiku&amp;utm_source=www.seznam.cz\">met</a> with SPD representatives on March 22.

The ČMKOS press release specifically <a href=\"https://www.cmkos.cz/cs/obsah/219/tiskova-zprava-vlada-je-patrne-bezradna-zrejme-proto-tresta/333054#:~:text=%E2%80%9EVl%C3%A1da%20ignoruje%20soci%C3%A1ln%C3%AD%20dialog.%20Ty%20opravdu%20d%C5%AFle%C5%BEit%C3%A9%20materi%C3%A1ly%20pos%C3%ADl%C3%A1%20%C4%8Dasto%20pozd%C4%9B%20a%20pop%C3%ADr%C3%A1%20sv%C3%A1%20vlastn%C3%AD%20slova\">states</a> : <i>&quot;The government ignores social dialogue. It often sends these really important materials late and denies its own words.&quot;</i></p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Spokesperson for the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs Eva Davidová told ČTK on Friday, March 17, that Petr Fiala&#39;s government is preparing to discuss the proposal for changing the rules for valorization of pensions in the week from March 20 to 26. Later that same day, however, Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka said that the cabinet would not discuss the proposal in that week. According to him, negotiations with representatives of the opposition, unions and employers should first take place and only then should the proposal be sent to the commenting office. Only then should the government discuss possible changes to the valorization.</p><p> A similar situation occurred in the case of the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs that the government would approve the adjustment of valorizations at the beginning of April. Marian Jurečka actually wrote on Twitter under Alena Schillerová&#39;s post that the proposal would first be discussed with the opposition and other partners. For these reasons, we assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>In his statement, Minister Jurečka describes the mechanism of extraordinary pension valorization, which, according to the <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155\">Pension Insurance</a> Act, will be used in the event of rapidly <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3400504-cesko-smeruje-k-mimoradnemu-zvysovani-duchodu-kvuli-inflaci\">increasing</a> inflation.</p><p> The conditions for increasing pensions in an extraordinary period are specifically described <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-3\">in Section 67.</a> According to it, an extraordinary valorization of pensions is applied if the growth of the <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-1\">consumer</a> price index has reached at least 5%. The merit part of the pension (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/429119-zvyseni-duchodu-je-definitivni-spocitejte-si-kolik-dostanete\">the percentage assessment</a> of the pension) is then <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3400504-cesko-smeruje-k-mimoradnemu-zvysovani-duchodu-kvuli-inflaci\">increased</a> by the same percentage as the price increase.</p><p> The period for determining price increases always begins with the calendar month following the end of the period according to which pensions were last valorized. In the case of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-4-a\">a regular valorization date,</a> price increases are monitored until the end of June of the previous year (in the case of a regular date in 2022, this would be the end of June 2021). However, in the case of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-4-b\">an extraordinary valorization</a> , the assessed period is shortened and ends with the month &quot; <i>in which price increases reached at least 5%.</i> Let us specify that these 5% must be the sum of <i>&quot;month-on-month</i> <i>inflation</i> <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/430759-dalsi-zvyseni-duchodu-mimoradna-valorizace-kvuli-inflaci\"><i>increases</i></a> &quot; for the given period.</p><p> Pensions are increased on a regular basis from <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-2\">January 1.</a> The last increase took place <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/finance/vice-penez-do-kapes-duchodcu-i-zamestnancu-letosni-rok-je-fi/r~c15e50f06c8f11ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/\">on January 1,</a> 2022, based on the increase in the consumer price index by the end <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">of June 2021</a> (.pdf). The last month <i>&quot;taken into account for pension valorization&quot;</i> was June, not July, which Marian Jurečka mentions in his statement. However, let us note that the period for determining price increases for further pension increases begins in July 2021.</p><p> The whole issue is also explained in a press release ( <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">.pdf</a> ) of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs from November 18, 2021. According to this report, pensions must be increased by a government decree if the above conditions are met. The government must issue this within <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-16\">50 days</a> of the end of the month in which prices increased by at least 5%. If the estimates come true, according to the ministry, the pension increase should take place in <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">June 2022</a> (.pdf).</p><p> In January, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/media-a-verejnost\">, Eva Davidová</a> , also <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/mimoradna-valorizace-penzi-snizi-tu-radnou-40384069\">commented</a> on the extraordinary valorization of pensions for the daily Právo: &quot; <i>We assume that there will be such a price increase in January that the cumulated inflation from July 2021 will exceed five percent and that the valorization will be carried out in an extraordinary period, which will include the entire price development until January 2022.&quot;</i> She also <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/mimoradna-valorizace-penzi-snizi-tu-radnou-40384069\">added</a> that the regular valorization of pensions in 2023 will be lower than if the extraordinary valorization had not occurred, but overall, both pension increases will reflect the overall price development.</p><p> As for the overall growth of the consumer price <a href=\"https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/cs/shortUrl?su=e730f7c1\">index</a> , from July to November 2021, this value increased by <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/430759-dalsi-zvyseni-duchodu-mimoradna-valorizace-kvuli-inflaci\">3.1%</a> . In December, there was a month-on-month increase of <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/indexy-spotrebitelskych-cen-inflace-prosinec-2021\">0.4%</a> , bringing the total number to 3.5%. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is therefore likely counting on an even faster increase of at least 1.5% in January, to a total of 5%.</p><p> Let us add that the Ministry of Finance, in its January macroeconomic prediction, <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2022/ekonomika-letos-poroste-o-31--prumerna-i-44286\">expects</a> a relatively sharp increase in the average inflation rate to 8.5% in 2022. According to information from the Czech Statistical Office, in 2021 it was <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/indexy-spotrebitelskych-cen-inflace-prosinec-2021\">3.8%</a> .</p><p> Given that Marian Jurečka describes the applicable rules for extraordinary valorization correctly, apart from a minor time inaccuracy, we assess this statement as true.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
