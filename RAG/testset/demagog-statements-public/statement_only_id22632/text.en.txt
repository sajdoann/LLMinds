On Friday (March 17, 2023, note: Demagog.cz), information appeared that was not from me, I immediately responded to it, I denied that I would not submit an amendment to this law (regulating the valorization mechanism, note: Demagog.cz) to the government either this week or next week until negotiations with social partners, with the opposition, and until I had completed the proper interdepartmental comment procedure. (...) Yesterday I also wrote this clearly under the account of the Chairwoman Alena Schillerov√° on Twitter.
