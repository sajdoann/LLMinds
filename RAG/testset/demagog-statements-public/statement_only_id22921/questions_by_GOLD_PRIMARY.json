    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Vít Rakušan talks about the resolution in connection with <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/babisuv-odhalil-ze-si-tiskne-vladni-maily-ve-firme-ze-sverenskych-fondu-98372\">the case of</a> Prime Minister Babiš from the beginning of April. During his regular <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2SwQpWtZTQE?t=332\">weekend report</a> (video) on his YouTube channel, Andrej Babiš read information about the financing of the health sector from a piece of paper on which an e-mail addressed to the Prime Minister from the Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, was printed on the other side. Minister Vojtěch sent the message to the Prime Minister&#39;s private e-mail address, who then forwarded it to an employee of the IMOBA company, who printed it for him.</p><p> <a href=\"https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vysledky?subjektId=713630&amp;typ=PLATNY\">IMOBA</a> is a member of the SynBiol concern, which is part of Andrej Babiš&#39;s <a href=\"https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66371830-kdo-je-kdo-ve-sverenskych-fondech-pres-ktere-podle-expertu-babis-dal-ovlada-agrofert-dulezite-funkce-maji-premierovi-pravnici-i-manzelka\">trust fund</a> called AB private trust I. The video also shows that Prime Minister Babiš uses his personal address with the domain &quot;e-babis.cz&quot; for government email communication. In response to the video, a wave of criticism arose, firstly, regarding the Prime Minister&#39;s continuing ties to his former trust companies and secondly, due to the way the Prime Minister operates with potentially sensitive government information on unsecured email addresses.</p><p> The 37th meeting of the House Committee on Security took place on May 14. According to its <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173747&amp;pdf=1\">invitation</a> (.pdf), the deputies were to discuss the 5th item <i>&quot;Securing government materials when using private e-mail addresses by the Prime Minister and members of the government&quot;.</i> This item was proposed by Vít Rakušan, and the head of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security Karel Řehka was also invited to comment. It is true that due to time constraints, this item <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-e-maily-soukroma-posta-imoba-bezpecnostni-vybor-poslanci-snemovna_2005190600_kno\">was not</a> discussed and was postponed to the next meeting of the House of Representatives, which is scheduled to take place at the end of May.</p><p> This particular meeting of the Security Committee was not public according to <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173747&amp;pdf=1\">the invitation</a> and no <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4905&amp;ido=1311&amp;kk=4&amp;td=3&amp;n=2\">minutes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4905&amp;ido=1311&amp;kk=5&amp;td=1&amp;n=9\">resolutions</a> have been made available yet. Therefore, we cannot verify whether the draft resolution that Vít Rakušan mentions actually contained information regarding the methodology of internet communication of government members.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>With this statement, Minister of the Interior Vít Rakušan is responding to <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22915\">the words of</a> Tomi Okamura, who spoke about the crime of foreigners and mentioned that last year the most offenses committed by foreigners were committed by Ukrainian citizens. In his response, the Austrian stated that with <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22920\">the increase</a> in the number of Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, it is logical that <i>&quot;criminal activity is also increasing in this group.&quot;</i> In the statement we verified, he illustrates that the increase in crime committed by foreigners does not correspond to the overall increase in foreigners living in the Czech Republic.</p><p> <strong>Number of foreigners</strong> <strong>in the Czech Republic</strong></p><p> According to the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO), in 2020, a total of 10,701,777 people lived in the Czech Republic ( <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/documents/11350/121768518/oby032221.xlsx/a8c817b5-693f-4cbd-8462-ca838eaed251?version=1.0\">.xlsx</a> ). This number <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/pocet_obyvatel_m\">includes</a> both citizens of the Czech Republic and foreigners. The annual report of the Ministry of the Interior on the state of public administration states that 634,790 foreigners resided in the Czech Republic at the end of the year ( <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/vyrocni-zprava-o-stavu-verejne-spravy-v-cr-v-r-2020.aspx\">.pdf</a> , p. 34). The representation of foreigners in society at the end of 2020 was approximately 5.9% ( <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/migrace/soubor/zprava-o-situaci-v-oblasti-migrace-a-integrace-cizincu-na-uzemi-ceske-republiky-v-roce-2021.aspx\">.pdf</a> , p. 77).</p><p> The latest population data <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/pohyb-obyvatelstva-1-ctvrtleti-2023\">was published</a> by the Czech Statistical Office as of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230901124029/https:/www.czso.cz/csu/czso/obyvatelstvo_lide\">March 31,</a> 2023, when the republic had 10,850,620 inhabitants. According to the Ministry of the Interior, on the same date, a total of 1,010,692 persons of foreign nationality were registered ( <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/migrace/soubor/ctvrtletni-zpravy-o-situaci-v-oblasti-migrace-dokumenty-ctvrtletni-zprava-o-migraci-i-2023.aspx\">.pdf</a> , p. 1), and the share of foreigners was therefore 9.3%. For the sake of completeness, let us add that according to later published <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230914150552/https:/www.czso.cz/csu/czso/obyvatelstvo_lide\">data</a> at the end of June, this share reached 9.5% ( <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/zpravy-o-migraci-ctvrtletni-zprava-o-migraci-ii-2023.aspx\">.pdf</a> , p. 1).</p><p> Vít Rakušan does not provide completely accurate figures for 2020 and 2023, especially regarding the share of foreigners in the total population of the Czech Republic, but he is right that the number of foreigners has roughly doubled. In terms of percentage, at the end of March 2023, the proportion of foreigners in the population increased by 3.4 percentage points compared to 2020. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" data-external=\"1\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/O5jxd/4/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-O5jxd\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" title=\"Population development of the Czech Republic\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> Sources: Czech Statistical <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/pohyb-obyvatelstva-1-ctvrtleti-2023\">Office</a> ( <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/191186709/1300702303.xlsx/91ca700f-150f-44ff-80a2-f8f8de53cce2?version=1.1\">.xlsx</a> ), Ministry of the Interior ( <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/vystupy-a-souvisejici-vyrocni-zprava-o-stavu-verejne-spravy-v-cr-v-r-2022.aspx\">.pdf</a> , p. 37; <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/migrace/soubor/ctvrtletni-zpravy-o-situaci-v-oblasti-migrace-dokumenty-ctvrtletni-zprava-o-migraci-i-2023.aspx\">.pdf</a> , p. 1).</p><p> <strong>Criminal activity of foreigners</strong></p><p> Statistical overviews of criminal activity are regularly <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/statistiky-kriminalita.aspx\">published</a> by the Police of the Czech Republic. To calculate the share of foreigners in criminal activity, we use two pieces of data – the number of <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/statisticke-prehledy-kriminality-za-rok-2023.aspx\">solved</a> crimes, i.e. those where the initiation and completion of criminal proceedings occurred in the same year. The second piece of data is the number of acts committed by foreigners out of these solved crimes ( <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/soubor/2023-06-cerven-sest-01a-xlsx.aspx\">.xlsx</a> ).</p><p> Statistics for 2020 ( <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/soubor/2020-12-prosinec-sest-01a-xlsx.aspx\">.xlsx</a> ) indicate that the police recorded a total of 6,350 crimes committed by foreigners in that year, while the total number of solved crimes reached 77,786. Foreigners were thus responsible for approximately 8.2% of crimes in 2020 for which the police identified the perpetrators.</p><p> So far, the latest <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230829200433/https:/www.policie.cz/clanek/statisticke-prehledy-kriminality-za-rok-2023.aspx\">police</a> <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/statisticke-prehledy-kriminality-za-rok-2023.aspx\">statistics</a> of the criminal activity overview ( <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/soubor/2023-06-cerven-sest-01a-xlsx.aspx\">.xlsx</a> ) cover the period from the beginning of January to the end of June 2023. It states that a total of 4,151 crimes were committed during this period, of which foreigners were accused. The total number of solved crimes was 38,233. Thus, in the first half of 2023, foreigners were responsible for approximately 10.9% of solved crimes. Compared to 2022, this share increased by approximately 2.7 percentage points. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" data-external=\"1\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/32TJe/6/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-32TJe\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" title=\"Development of crime in the Czech Republic\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> In 2020, the share of foreigners in the population was 5.9%, and as of March 31 this year it was 9.3%. According to data from the Police of the Czech Republic, foreigners participated in criminal activity by 8.2% in 2020, while in the first half of 2023 by 10.9%.</p><p> The Minister of the Interior therefore provides slightly inaccurate data, but compared to the actual data, most of it is still within the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=avast-a-2&amp;q=10+%25+odchylka+demagog&amp;oq=10+%25+odchylka+demagog&amp;aqs=avast..69i57.7102j0j1&amp;ie=UTF-8\">10%</a> deviation we tolerate. Only the share of foreigners in the Czech population mentioned by the Austrian (in whose case the deviation reaches 18%) did not fit into it.</p><p> Based on these data, the Austrian&#39;s conclusion that the increase in the number of foreigners (by 3.4 pp) does not correspond to the increase in the share of foreigners in criminal activity (by 2.7 pp) can also be considered correct.</p><p> For the reasons stated, we assess Vít Rakušan&#39;s statement as true, but due to slightly inaccurate data, as true with reservations.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Vít Rakušan <a href=\"https://www.vitrakusan.cz/zivotopis/\">studied</a> history, German studies, and school management. He then <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2786660-z-ucitele-nemciny-hvezdou-komunalni-politiky-rakusan-zacal-karieru-jako-nestranik\">taught</a> German at a grammar school in Kutná Hora.</p><p> The Russian Liberation Army (ROA), known as the Vlasovs, <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/exhibit/rukavovy-znak-jednotek-ruske-osvobozenecke-armady-vlasovcu/\">was formed</a> in November 1944. This happened after General Vlasov <a href=\"https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach\">was captured</a> by the Germans during the defense of Leningrad. The ROA <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/veda-technologie/historie/ustr-historik-historie-osvobozeni-cesko-rusko-vlasovci_1912141111_hag\">members</a> included Soviet prisoners of war and the so-called white emigration, or people who left the USSR in the 1920s and decided to fight against Stalin. Their main <a href=\"https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach\">goal</a> was to defeat Stalin. Germany was to help them achieve these goals. On the side of Nazi Germany, <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">they fought</a> against the USSR in the area between the Oder and the Neisse.</p><p> However, in the spring of 1945, it became <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">clear</a> to Vlasov (audio, time from 15:30) that he could not count on Germany&#39;s help in the long-term fight against Stalin. On the contrary, the Germans were rather using Vlasov&#39;s army for their own purposes. For this reason, he decided to leave Germany with his army for Linz. In an attempt to win the favor of the Allied (or American) troops, he then decided, together with General Bunyachenko, to help liberate Prague.</p><p> <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/zradci-a-vrazi-nebo-zneuznani-osvoboditele-diskuze-o-vyznamu-kontroverznich-8121440\">They arrived</a> in Prague on May 5, 1945.

The STAN national committee <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/info-a-media/tiskove-zpravy/celostatni-vybor-hnuti-stan-schvalil-koalicni-smlouvu-s-piraty\">approved</a> the agreement on January 7, and the Pirates approved it at their national online forum <a href=\"https://www.pirati.cz/tiskove-zpravy/79-procent-piratu-odsouhlasila-koalici-se-stan.html\">on January 12,</a> 2021.</p><p> The coalition <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/fmfile/0/files/2020%20hlavn%C3%AD%20STAN/koalicni-smlouva-pirati-a-starostove.pdf\">agreement</a> (.pdf, Appendix No. 2, page 2) states regarding the coalition council:</p><p> <i>&quot;2.1. The highest body of the coalition is <strong>the coalition council</strong> , which meets in the format of 2 to 5 members in equal numbers for each coalition party (…).&quot;</i></p><p> The scope of the coalition council&#39;s activities is then listed in point 2.3. (ibid., pp. 2–3).<i> </i>For example, the council will approve the coalition&#39;s program, be responsible for fulfilling legal obligations (p. 6), create a joint post-election negotiation team (p. 7), or approve rules regarding the management of joint property (ibid., Appendix No. 4, p. 3).</p><p> As for disputes, point no. 12 (ibid., Appendix no. 2, p. 8) regarding their resolution states as follows:</p><p> <i>&quot;12.1. If a dispute arises between the parties to this contract regarding the performance, interpretation or alleged breach of this contract or its threat, the parties undertake to resolve it amicably, by personal negotiations between the interested parties or by negotiations with a mediator whom both parties trust, or by referral to a higher level within the coalition, or to the national leaders of the coalition parties, and to make all necessary efforts to reach an agreement and resolve the matter amicably.&quot;</i></p><p> <i>&quot;12.2. If the dispute cannot be resolved by agreement or negotiation, either party has the right to initiate conciliation proceedings, based on a written proposal to <strong>the coalition council. Three representatives of each contracting party participate in the conciliation proceedings</strong> .&quot;</i></p><p> Disputes between the parties of the coalition are therefore resolved in various ways. However, it is true that significant disputes can be resolved by the coalition council as the highest body. At the same time, it is true that, for example, in the area of programs or post-election negotiations, the coalition council is the key decision-making body, which is thus superior to party bodies.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The meeting of the House Committee on Security described in the statement, at which the &quot;information of the Director of the Security Information Service (BIS) on some articles published in the previous two weeks in the online edition of the Respekt periodical&quot; was <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173469\">discussed</a> ( <i>.doc)</i> , took place on May 6, 2020 and was <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=4916&amp;dx=20200506\">not public</a> .</p><p> The meeting took place in response to <a href=\"https://www.respekt.cz/tydenik/2020/18/muz-s-ricinem\">an article</a> in the weekly magazine Respekt, in which Ondřej Kundra described the arrival of a man from Russia with a diplomatic passport who had ricin (a poison) in his briefcase.

However, the factual statements contained in the statements are different; here we focused on whether (all) preparatory steps based on Pavel Řehák&#39;s recommendations were carried out over the summer.</p><p> Vít Rakušan talks here about <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/muze-s-tabulkou-uz-podruhe-neposlechli-pak-cesko-zaskocila-druha-vlna-125528\">Pavel Řehák&#39;s</a> team, which at the end of May 2020 created <a href=\"https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY\">a document</a> (.pdf) entitled &quot;Rapid Response System for a Possible Second Wave of the Covid-19 Epidemic and Other Epidemics&quot;. This material recommends 32 specific steps that need to be taken to minimize the impact of the next wave of Covid-19 on the health of the population and the economy. Let us add that Pavel Řehák <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/muze-s-tabulkou-uz-podruhe-neposlechli-pak-cesko-zaskocila-druha-vlna-125528\">sent</a> the aforementioned document to Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and other ministers on May 26.</p><p> In short, the material calls for rapid data evaluation, a rapid response in the implementation of epidemiological measures, and a massive increase in testing capacities, or rather, ensuring a system that will then be able to handle a large number of tests. It also calls for the creation of a central call center, which will allow for a multiple increase in the capacities of regional hygiene stations and enable effective tracing of the infected even with higher numbers of infected people.</p><p> This advisory document also points out that the current Pandemic Plan of the Czech Republic ( <a href=\"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/wepub/5520/14546/Pandemick%C3%BD%20pl%C3%A1n%20%C4%8CR.pdf\">.pdf</a> ) was created for an influenza <a href=\"https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY\">epidemic</a> (.pdf, p. 13) and needs to be updated, through the Central Epidemiological Commission (.pdf, p. 7 et seq.).</p><p> The Central Epidemiological Commission did not really meet &quot;in the summer months&quot;, as Vít Rakušan states in his statement.

It then met on May 15, but the next meeting did not take place until <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/ustredni-epidemiologicka-komise-bude-jednat-o-covidu-19/1932645\">September 17, 2020.</a> The fact that the Central Epidemiological Commission did not meet in the summer was even described as a mistake by Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/babis-byla-chyba-ze-se-epidemiologicka-komise-v-lete-nesesla/1934219\">Andrej Babiš</a> .</p><p> Among other recommendations that Pavel Řehák&#39;s material contained and that did not &quot;run&quot; during the summer months, one can select, for example, the aforementioned establishment of a central call center for tracing contacts of infected people ( <a href=\"https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY\">.pdf</a> , p. 8). On September 14, 2020, the then Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/hygienikum-ma-ulehcit-call-centrum-mozna-nekdy-na-podzim-planuje-vojtech-119777\">stated</a> that its creation would take place <i>&quot;during the autumn&quot;</i> . Let us add that regional hygiene stations began to have problems with <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/napor-na-hygieny-sili-ktere-kraje-nestihaji-trasovat-121213\">tracking</a> in the second half of August. With the situation worsening, in October, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/hygiena-trasovani-firmy-vyzva-call-centra-trasovani_2010111124_tzr\">called on</a> Czech companies to have their call center employees help regional hygiene stations with tracing.</p><p> Another recommendation that the government did not implement in the summer months is to ensure higher <a href=\"https://texty.hlidacstatu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pouceni-z-krize-COVID19-20200526-clear.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2i2iuSPO6YM3dyQhp9fN9OOXS5Rfj1dlvPWX3d5PJOGKWRn4Jg_savpEY\">testing capacities</a> (.pdf, pages 20 and 21). The Czech Republic only reached the recommended numbers of 30–50 thousand tests per day almost in <a href=\"https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19\">mid-</a> October.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
