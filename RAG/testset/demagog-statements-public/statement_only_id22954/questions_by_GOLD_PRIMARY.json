No studies that would determine exactly how individual components contribute to the increase in inflation <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030500912/\">have</a> apparently been conducted (video, 9:02).</p><p> Economists such as <a href=\"https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/\">Jan Švejnar</a> (video, 0:46) and <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030500912/\">Štěpán Jurajda</a> (video, 8:57) include, for example, the disruption of import chains, i.e. delays or shortages of some raw materials, among the international influences on price increases. Some input raw materials can also become more expensive, the main ones recently being <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/energy-chaos-adds-to-inflation-angst-for-europe-s-policy-makers?sref=qI83munY\">energy</a> , <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3379052-kremikove-trzni-peklo-zdrazil-o-tri-sta-procent-a-do-problemu-dostal-mnoho-odvetvi\">silicon</a> , <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3383072-kvuli-nedostatku-cipu-automobilky-prijdou-o-biliony-korun-nedodelana-auta-stoji\">chips</a> or <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/zdrazovani-materialu-cesko-ceny-stavba-rekonstrukce_2111021338_ern\">building materials</a> such as <a href=\"https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/\">wood</a> (video, 3:08).

Therefore, this type of inflation is called <a href=\"https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/\">supply-side inflation</a> (video, 3:08), which is caused by an increase in the prices of inputs to production.</p><p> As for the domestic influences that contribute to this wave of rising inflation, we can mention, for example, the words of the head of the National Budget Council <a href=\"https://echo24.cz/a/Sx5mc/ceka-nas-to-nejhorsi-ekonomove-reaguji-na-tvrdy-boj-cnb-s-inflaci\">, Eva Zamrazilová:</a> <i>&quot;The connection between inflation and the legacy of the previous fiscal policy is obvious, and we have repeatedly pointed out this fact. The problem of inflation certainly cannot be brushed off the table by saying that it is purely global imported inflation.&quot;</i></p><p> Economist <a href=\"https://forbes.cz/horska-hleda-se-vinik-inflace-jen-globalni-problemy-za-ni-nemohou/\">Helena Horská</a> , for example, talks about the government&#39;s influence on price increases. She states that when the economy reopens, most restaurateurs, hoteliers, and service providers in general will increase their prices to offset losses from the lockdown period and meet increased deferred demand. She also adds: <i>&quot;This demand is being inflated by other factors. Specifically, the abolition of the super-gross wage, the increase in pensions beyond the framework of valorization, the abolition of the real estate acquisition tax, and other steps that have loosened budgetary discipline so much that even after the pandemic subsides, the state treasury is expected to be short of almost 400 billion crowns during the economic boom.&quot;</i> However, Helena Horská does not see government policy as the main cause of inflation.</p><p> The only government influence is a short quote <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/volby/volby-do-snemovny/vlada-je-spoluvinikem-inflace-zbytecne-utraci-dluh-statu-rychle-roste-a-je-stale-drazsi-1383895\">from Petr Kříž</a> in the daily E15, who lists high state budget deficits or rising pensions as causes. However, such statements are exceptions. According to the rest of the article and other economists cited here, however, government policy is not the main culprit of the current inflation.</p><p> The CNB <a href=\"https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/komentare-cnb-ke-zverejnenym-statistickym-udajum-o-inflaci-a-hdp/Inflace-v-zari-2021-vysoko-nad-prognozou-CNB-a-horni-hranici-tolerancniho-pasma-cile/\">sees the cause of the current high inflation elsewhere</a> than in &quot;poor state management&quot;. According to it, one of the main causes is <i>&quot;a surge in consumer demand after the dismantling of anti-epidemic measures&quot;,</i> which leads to a sharp increase in prices in the service sector, while at the same time the growth in prices of goods has accelerated, as Helena Horská also <a href=\"https://forbes.cz/horska-hleda-se-vinik-inflace-jen-globalni-problemy-za-ni-nemohou/\">states</a> . However, according to the CNB, this effect also occurs in other countries. The CNB <a href=\"https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/komentare-cnb-ke-zverejnenym-statistickym-udajum-o-inflaci-a-hdp/Inflace-v-zari-2021-vysoko-nad-prognozou-CNB-a-horni-hranici-tolerancniho-pasma-cile/\">identified</a> another significant cause of inflation as &quot; <i>the high growth in industrial producer prices in the world due to disruptions in supply chains, to which is added a significant increase in the price of many raw materials and materials&quot;.</i> At the end of its commentary, the CNB writes about <i>&quot;unexpectedly strong and widespread inflationary pressures from the domestic and foreign economies&quot;</i> . CNB Governor Rusnok has previously <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/cnb-prekvapila-uroky-vyskocily-na-150-175938\">pointed out</a> that the government&#39;s budgetary policy is at least partly causing today&#39;s level of inflation. On the other hand, CNB Councilor Aleš Michl <a href=\"https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/autorske-clanky-rozhovory-s-predstaviteli-cnb/Nesmysly-o-inflaci/\">stated</a> that the government <i>&quot;cannot really be held responsible&quot;</i> for inflation.</p><p> Petr Fiala emphasizes in his statement that economists and the Czech National Bank attribute equal credit for rising inflation to international factors and the previous government&#39;s economic management. The statements of some economists may be in line with the Prime Minister&#39;s statement, although this is clearly a minority position. However, the published positions of representatives of the Czech National Bank are completely inconsistent with the Prime Minister&#39;s statement - the Czech National Bank attributes the main responsibility for rising inflation to international influences. We therefore assess Fiala&#39;s statement as untrue.</p><p> Let us add that in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/0/2-17122021-AP-EN.pdf/ebf0659e-db3c-fc20-9faa-e74964b1827d\">November</a> (.pdf) 2021, the inflation rate in the Czech Republic was below the European Union average, at 4.8 percent. Finally, let us also state that we have verified Petr Fiala&#39;s <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/21147\">statements</a> about <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/21233\">inflation</a> in the past.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>In June 2023, the government of Petr Fiala adopted <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/zvlady/usneseni/2023/449/\">a resolution</a> ( <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/2023/449/pdf/\">.pdf</a> ) approving the preliminary proposal of the Ministry of Finance on the amount of state budget revenues and expenditures for 2024. This was not a finished government budget proposal, but only a <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3595254-vlada-schvalila-predbezny-navrh-rozpoctu-na-rok-2024-se-schodkem-235-miliard\">preliminary</a> plan that did not contain a detailed outline of individual components on the revenue and expenditure side. This proposal <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/ministerstvo/media/tiskove-zpravy/2023/vlada-schvalila-predpokladane-parametry-51706\">calculated</a> a deficit of CZK 235 billion. Prime Minister Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/statni-rozpocet-schodek-vlada-stanjura-fiala_2306212154_har\">added</a> to the proposal that the final budget deficit would not exceed CZK 270 billion, which the government had already set as the budget deficit <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3594452-je-jen-ramec-rekl-o-270miliardovem-deficitu-kupka-podle-havlicka-je-vlada-chaoticka\">ceiling</a> <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/vlada-schodek-snizit-na-270-miliard-korun_2306142120_hof\">before</a> adopting the resolution.</p><p> At the end <a href=\"https://www.odok.cz/portal/veklep/material/KORNCV8KBV8T/\">of August</a> , the Ministry of Finance <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/ministerstvo/media/tiskove-zpravy/2023/navrh-rozpoctu-na-rok-2024-52808\">submitted</a> to the government the final draft budget for 2024, which envisages total revenues of CZK 1,921.2 billion and expenditures of CZK 2,173.2 billion. The budget deficit is thus <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3611504-ministerstvo-predlozilo-vlade-navrh-rozpoctu-se-schodkem-252-miliard\">planned</a> at CZK 252 billion ( <a href=\"https://1drv.ms/w/s!AuXRjwyZOj5-szj-hbJ8QyXVm69H?e=n9R2tm\">.docx</a> , page 1).</p><p> To summarize, the Ministry of Finance proposed a state budget deficit of CZK 235 billion for next year. In fact, this was not a government proposal, but only a preliminary plan for the ministry. Even before the approval of this proposal, cabinet representatives stated that the deficit would not exceed CZK 270 billion. The final budget proposal for 2024 then calculates a deficit of CZK 252 billion. We therefore assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Petr Fiala answered <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030501017/#t=48m28s\">a question</a> in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions (video, time 48:28) that mentioned that more than a million voters lost their votes in the parliamentary elections, and are therefore not represented in the Chamber of Deputies. Petr Fiala stated (time 49:22) that <i>&quot;good government governs for everyone, even for those who did not vote for it&quot;</i> . He then illustrates this position by referring to his older statement from the election staff, which is the content of the verified statement.</p><p> Petr Fiala, in the SPOLU coalition&#39;s election staff, gave his first post-election speech on October 9, when <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3383514-zmeny-je-tady-my-jsme-ji-slibili-my-ji-udelame-rekl-lidr-spolu-fiala\">he said</a> (video, time 1:52): <i>&quot;(…) I would like to ask you something in this context. All of you who are watching us. It doesn&#39;t matter who you voted for, it doesn&#39;t matter what your political preferences are. First and foremost, we are all citizens of the Czech Republic who want to live here and we want to live here together, as neighbors, as friends, as colleagues. That is what unites us all.&quot;</i></p><p> Let us add that the SPOLU coalition <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps124?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xkraj=0&amp;xstrana=13&amp;xv=1\">, consisting of</a> ODS, TOP 09 and KDU-ČSL, won <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">27.79%</a> of the votes in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, finishing first.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Alena Schillerová <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/statni-zamestnanci-platy-za-rok-2020-vzrust-prumerneho-platu_2105150933_kuc\">spoke</a> about freezing the salaries of civil servants in the spring of 2021. According to the former Minister of Finance, salaries should only <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/v-mediich/2021/schillerova-vyvoj-pandemie-rozhodne-o-no-41240\">be increased</a> for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers as part of the consolidation of public finances. Although <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/schillerova-chci-obnovit-eet-40358028\">she stated</a> several times in <a href=\"https://cnn.iprima.cz/pojdme-rusit-danove-vyjimky-vyzvala-alena-schillerova-dane-pry-zvysovat-nechce-23442\">April</a> that she did not want to reduce the salaries of firefighters and police officers, she did not talk about increasing their salaries.</p><p> Let us also add that in <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3326254-odbory-kritizuji-plan-na-zmrazeni-platu-statnich-zamestnancu-schillerova-na-nem\">June 2021</a> , the government of Andrej Babiš approved a draft state budget, which envisaged that the salary freeze would apply not only to civil servants, but also to police officers, firefighters and soldiers. The only exception was to be teachers&#39; salaries. Alena Schillerová stated at the time that the government could not afford to increase the salaries of civil servants due to the high state budget deficit.</p><p> The then Minister of the Interior, Hamáček, <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/hamacek-rakusan-fiala-rozpocet-bis.A210829_120337_domaci_vlc\">had</a> long opposed freezing the salaries of police officers and firefighters, and on the contrary, proposed a 3.5% increase in salaries for these groups.</p><p> However, former Minister Schillerová finally reversed course in September 2021 and <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/platy-statnich-zamestnancu-nakonec-vzrostou-potvrdila-poprve-schillerova-40372366\">agreed</a> to increase the salaries of all civil servants, including firefighters and police officers, although debates continued over the rate of increase. The ČSSD opposed a percentage increase and proposed a fixed monetary amount. In mid- <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3398176-zive-vlada-k-mimoradne-pomoci-kvuli-zdrazovani-energii\">November</a> , Andrej Babiš&#39;s government finally approved a blanket <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/od-ledna-se-zvysi-platy-ve-statnim-a-verejnem-sektoru-o-1-400-korun--rozhodla-vlada-191806/\">increase in civil servants&#39; salaries</a> by more than a thousand crowns, starting in January 2022.</p><p> On December 29, 2021, the government of Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/vlada-prida-socialnim-pracovnikum-zdravotnikum-a-ucitelum/2138652\">approved</a> a salary increase for only some civil servants. The new government had previously announced that it did not agree with a blanket increase. The salaries of social service workers are to increase by 700 crowns from January 2022, the salaries of healthcare workers by 6% and teachers by 2%. The government also approved an increase in the salaries of soldiers, firefighters and police officers by 700 crowns. The government of Petr Fiala decided to freeze the salaries of civil servants in ministries and other offices from January.</p><p> In the spring of last year, Alena Schillerová publicly declared that she wanted to save on the salaries of civil servants as part of the consolidation. She wanted to increase salaries only for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers. In September, she proposed increasing salaries for all civil servants. However, neither position corresponds to the move by the Fiala government. The government increased salaries for more groups of employees than Alena Schillerová proposed in the spring, but at the same time, the new cabinet increased salaries by less than the then minister had planned in September.</p><p> Petr Fiala thus incorrectly states that his government did exactly what Alena Schillerová proposed. Moreover, the Prime Minister points out the former minister&#39;s alleged hypocrisy by drawing attention to her relatively restrictive stance from the spring, but neglecting her more budgetary-relaxed position from September 2021.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The European refugee crisis, as the wave of migration to Europe in 2015 and 2016 was called, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/czech-republic/news/migrace/migrace_historicky_prehled_cs\">began</a> in the spring of 2015 and was caused by the escalation of the <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3283818-krvavy-konflikt-v-syrii-vypukl-pred-deseti-lety-u-moci-zustava-oslabeny-basar-asad\">war</a> in Syria. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/48Cio/1/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-48Cio\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" title=\"Number of asylum applications to EU countries\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></figure><p> A dispute arose in the European Union over the redistribution of refugees heading to Europe who had already arrived in Greece and Italy.

However, the loudest opposition <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">came</a> from <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/mezinarodni-organizace-a-vs-visegradska-ctyrka.aspx\">the Visegrad Four</a> . The quotas <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">were</a> approved by EU interior ministers in September 2015. In December of the same year, Slovakia and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">filed</a> a lawsuit with the Court of Justice of the EU against the redistribution of asylum seekers based on quotas. In June 2017, for example, the Czech government <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vlada-cesko-uz-neprijme-zadneho-migranta-na-zaklade-kvot-zhorsila-se_1706051706_pj\">decided</a> that it would no longer accept any asylum seekers based on quotas, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">accepting</a> 12 of the 2,600 people allocated.</p><p> The European Commission then decided to open infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In September 2017, the relocation programme for applicants from Greece and Italy <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">ended</a> , with 29,144 people out of 160,000 being relocated and only five countries fulfilling their quotas. In April 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">had failed to fulfil</a> their obligations under European Union law.</p><p> On the contrary, in 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3173733-od-vety-zvladneme-uplynulo-pet-let-rozhodla-bych-se-stejne-tvrdi-merkelova\">took a</a> welcoming stance towards accepting refugees with her famous media statement &quot;we will <i>manage it</i> &quot;. At that time, Germany <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/migr_asyappctza/default/table?lang=en\">was</a> also the country with the highest number of asylum applications. However, Armin Laschet, the CDU candidate for chancellor in the September German elections, has now expressed the opposite. After the capture of Kabul, <a href=\"https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fluechtlinge-afghanistan-121.html\">he stated</a> that Germany &quot; <i>must not give the impression that we can accept every person in need</i> &quot;.</p><p> French President Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/evropsky-parlament/v-evrope-rostou-nove-ploty-unie-se-boji-uprchlicke-vlny-z-af/r~a5d8490204d511ec966d0cc47ab5f122/\">spoke</a> about the need to &quot; <i>defend against illegal migration</i> &quot; after the fall of Kabul. His predecessor, François Hollande, chose a different rhetoric in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-france/hollande-opens-french-doors-to-refugees-despite-opposition-idUKKCN0R70WC20150907\">saying he</a> would &quot; <i>get the crisis under control</i> &quot; and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/french-president-francois-hollande-welcomes-refugees-paris-attack/story?id=35274658\">defending</a> his decision to uphold his refugee admission commitments despite the terrorist attacks in Paris.</p><p> Six EU member states, including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/six-countries-urge-eu-not-stop-deportations-afghanistan-belgium-says-2021-08-10/\">sent</a> a letter to the European Commission in early August 2021 warning against halting deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers, despite the Taliban&#39;s advance in their homeland. However, Germany, along with another signatory of the letter, the Netherlands, subsequently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">announced</a> that they would not deport the unaccepted Afghans for the time being due to the development of the conflict. However, Austria <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">did not change</a> its position and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-austria-pm-wont-take-in-any-more-afghanistan-refugees-taliban/\">ruled out</a> accepting people fleeing Afghanistan, saying that this would not happen during his term in office. The Greek Minister for Migration, whose country <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/grafika-reseni-migracni-krize/r~1a7e43b8e45911e59e52002590604f2e/\">faced</a> a strong influx of migrants due to its position during the last crisis and is another signatory of the letter, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">said</a> that &quot; <i>the EU is not prepared and does not have the capacity to handle another major migration crisis</i> &quot;.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>We were unable to find the letter mentioned by Petr Fiala in publicly available sources, so we contacted the European Commission Representation in the Czech Republic to ask whether the President of the European Commission had received the letter from Prime Minister Petr Fiala with the request that Fiala was talking about.</p><p> The Head of the Representation&#39;s Press Department, <a href=\"https://czechia.representation.ec.europa.eu/novinky-udalosti/tiskove-centrum_cs\">Magdaléna Frouzová,</a> confirmed to us that European Commission President Von Der Leyen received a letter from Fiala: <i>&quot;Yes, we can confirm that the President of the Commission received a letter from the Czech Prime Minister, in which she formulates the position of the Czech government supporting the inclusion of gas and nuclear energy in the EU taxonomy, in full accordance with the resolution adopted by both chambers of the Czech Parliament on December 15, 2021.&quot;</i></p><p> Petr Fiala also refers to the resolution of the Czech Parliament in his statement. On December 14, 2021, the Chamber of Deputies <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2021ps/stenprot/004schuz/bqbs/b02100901.htm\">voted</a> on <i>the Resolution of the Parliament on the necessary role of nuclear energy in the decarbonization of the economy</i> . This is <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=15300\">a resolution</a> according to which the Chamber of Deputies:</p><ul><li> notes that the Czech Republic has committed to the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal,</li><li> appreciates that the EU recognises the right of Member States to freely choose the composition of their energy mix,</li><li> stresses that the Czech Republic, due to its geographical conditions, is unable to meet its obligations without the use of nuclear energy,</li><li> recalls that the important role of nuclear energy was also confirmed by the President of the European Commission,</li><li> therefore notes that nuclear energy must be fully recognised as part of the solution for decarbonising the economy. It cannot be seen as just a &quot;transitional&quot; category, but as a tool that &quot;enables&quot; the low-carbon transformation of the economy and makes it economically and socially sustainable in the long term. The criteria for the sustainability of the low-carbon transformation of the economy should be technologically neutral and must not differentiate between generations of nuclear installations or reactor technology,</li><li> also notes that the Czech Republic intends to temporarily use natural gas in its mix,</li><li> Calls on the EU to include gas as a transitional source and nuclear energy as a sustainable source,</li><li> instructs Andrej Babiš, the outgoing Prime Minister, to present this opinion to the European Council at its meeting on 15 December 2021.</li></ul><p> The majority of deputies, with the exception of SPD representatives, voted <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=77438&amp;l=cz\">in favor of</a> this proposal.
