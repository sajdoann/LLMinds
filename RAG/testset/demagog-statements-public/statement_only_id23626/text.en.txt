Back then, sometime in (â€¦) about 2015, there was an agreement between the opposition and the coalition. At that time, ANO and Social Democracy were in power, and we (the STAN movement, note Demagog.cz) were in opposition. And we said: let&#39;s set up an automatic system so that when the economy is doing well, the salaries (of politicians, note Demagog.cz) will grow, and when the economy is doing badly, the salaries will not grow.
