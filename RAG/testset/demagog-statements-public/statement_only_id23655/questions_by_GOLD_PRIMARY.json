    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) is talking about the length of processing applications for housing allowance, not the time period between processing the application and payment of the allowance – the editor is asking about the system of granting social benefits, not about their payment. Jurečka, with his words <i>“we pay housing allowance within the deadlines set by law”</i> , clearly points out that timely processing of the application helps to pay the allowance for the retroactively recognised period within the deadline set by law. However, he then refers the mentioned number of days to the length of the procedure itself. Let us note that the deadline for processing an application for housing allowance is <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p71-3\">30 days</a> according to the Administrative Code, or up to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p71-3-a\">60 days</a> if it is a complex case or if the Labour Office has to <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/socialni-davky-prispevek-na-bydleni-zpozdeni-urad-prace-jurecka_2303291008_ako\">conduct</a> a social investigation ( <a href=\"https://www.ochrance.cz/letaky/rizeni-o-davkach-pomoci-v-hn/rizeni-o-davkach-pomoci-v-hn.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 2).</p><p> We could not find any statistics in publicly available sources that would discuss the length of processing an application for housing allowance. We therefore asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MLSA) to send us the data that Minister Jurečka draws on in his statement. We subsequently received a graph with internal data from the MLSA, which documents the average processing time for applications for housing allowance within the individual regional directorates of the Labour Office in the period from June 1 to July 28 of this year.</p><p> However, the average processing time does not in itself exclude the possibility that in individual cases applications could be processed beyond the legally prescribed deadline. Likewise, the graph did not in any way support Minister Jurečka&#39;s claim that <i>&quot;in 98 percent of cases</i> (application processing takes around the 30-day mark, note: Demagog.cz) <i>it is only because we have asked the client to deliver something to us, and he has not yet provided us with the requested document or information.&quot;</i></p><p> We therefore contacted the Ministry again with a request for statistics on all cases where the deadline was met and when it was not, as well as for supporting the claim about the reasons for the time limit for processing applications for the allowance in Prague. However, we have not received another response, and we therefore consider the statement to be unverifiable.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka already <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/ekonomika-jurecka-duchodovy-vek-bude-podle-profese-a-vzdelani-40422115\">mentioned</a> in February that nothing would change for people born before 1973 as part of <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3564561-dnesni-tricatniky-ceka-penze-v-68-letech-ukazuje-interni-dokument-ministerstva-prace\">the planned</a> pension <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3455032-vlada-chysta-zmenu-duchodoveho-systemu-navrhuje-drivejsi-penzi-u-narocnych-profesi\">reform</a> . A few days later, Minister Jurečka also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3565087-posun-duchodoveho-veku-nad-65-let-se-podle-fialy-tykal-tech-kdo-pujdou-do-penze-za\">spoke out</a> towards younger generations: <i>&quot;If we continued and did nothing like our predecessors did, young people simply would not have a decent pension.&quot;</i></p><p> Similarly, Prime Minister Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3565087-posun-duchodoveho-veku-nad-65-let-se-podle-fialy-tykal-tech-kdo-pujdou-do-penze-za\">spoke</a> to Czech Television in February, specifically talking about <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/duchod-odchod-68-let-cesi-penze-vek-duchodci_2302122005_ula\">a possible</a> postponement of retirement: <i>&quot;It cannot apply to people who are about to retire. That is out of the question. (…) It would have to be long-term – for people who will retire in twenty or thirty years.&quot;</i></p><p> The Minister of Finance Zbyněk Stanjura (ODS) also spoke about the pension reform on the ČT24 program Interview, back in January, when he specifically <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3558744-vlada-lidem-penize-nedava-jen-jim-bere-mene-rika-stanjura\">said</a> (video, time 27:57): <i>&quot;It will probably not, a possible change in the rules, affect people who have a few years until retirement, because (...) they will not be given enough time to, for example, change their behavior, for example, save more. It will primarily affect the generation of about 50 minus, maybe 45 minus.&quot;</i></p>\nSECTION C: <p>In the context of the statement, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) describes the demographic development and changes in the behavior of Czech society, which, according to him, necessitate a pension reform and an increase in the retirement age ( <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1096898594-udalosti-komentare/224411000371030/\">video</a> , time: 22:50). According to Jurečka, a recent projection by demographers shows, for example, that the number of people of working age who <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/myty-fakta-duchody#:~:text=FAKT%3A%20LID%C3%89%20V,na%20d%C5%AFchodov%C3%A9%20poji%C5%A1t%C4%9Bn%C3%AD\">finance</a> the pension system through pension contributions will decrease. In this context, Jurečka also claims that the latest projection assumes even worse development than the projections from previous years.</p><p> <strong>Demographic projection of the Czech Statistical Office</strong></p><p> The Czech Statistical Office (CZSO) publishes a demographic projection every five years ( <a href=\"https://www.rozpoctovarada.cz/ke-stazeni/informacni-studie-alternativni-demograficke-projekce/\">.pdf</a> , p. 3). <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/projekce-obyvatelstva-ceske-republiky-2023-2100\">The last</a> projection was published in 2023, the previous one in <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/projekce-obyvatelstva-ceske-republiky-2018-2100\">2018.</a> This task <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1991-582#p10b-1\">is assigned</a> to it by the Act on the Organization and Implementation of Social Security. The projection is intended to include the expected development of mortality, fertility and migration in the Czech Republic.</p><p> The Czech Statistical Office processes population projections in three variants – medium, low and high ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 1). These variants differ mainly in the projected number of the Czech Republic&#39;s population – in the medium variant it is stable, in the high variant it is growing, in the low variant it is decreasing ( <a href=\"https://www.rozpoctovarada.cz/ke-stazeni/informacni-studie-alternativni-demograficke-projekce/\">.pdf</a> , p. 3). The authors of the Czech Statistical Office studies state that the medium variant represents the most likely scenario for future population development ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 1). We will therefore base our assessment of Marian Jurečka&#39;s statement on data from this medium variant, comparing data from projections from 2018 and 2023.</p><p> <strong>Life expectancy</strong></p><p> Life expectancy at birth is <a href=\"https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Nad%C4%9Bje_do%C5%BEit%C3%AD\">an indicator of</a> life expectancy, which indicates the average age a child born in a given generation will live to. Marian Jurečka claims that <i>&quot;we will live to an even older age&quot;,</i> meaning that life expectancy will increase.</p><p> According to the latest projection by the Czech Statistical Office, life expectancy in the Czech Republic has actually been increasing since 1989, with the exception of higher mortality in 2020–2022 associated with the Covid-19 pandemic ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 5). Although this increase has been slowing down over the years, between 2023 and 2050, life expectancy should increase by 5.2 years to 82.2 years for men and by 4.1 years to 87.1 years for women ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 6). In contrast, the projection from 2018 ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 4) assumed a slower increase in expected life expectancy. However, as the following table shows, the older projection does not fundamentally differ from the newer one, especially in the case of data for the period of the next approximately 35 years. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" data-external=\"1\" height=\"430\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1ylDB/6/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-1ylDB\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" title=\"Life expectancy of men and women (CZSO projections 2018 and 2023)\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> <strong>Number of people of working age</strong></p><p> The productive component of the population is the age <a href=\"https://ghostarchive.org/archive/sI84D\">group</a> between 15 and 64. From 2009 to 2021, its share in the population decreased, but with the arrival of refugees in 2022 it strengthened. The latest projection of the Czech Statistical Office predicted an increase for 2023 and 2024 ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 13).</p><p> The working-age population is projected to begin declining in the mid-1930s ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 14). By the end of the 2050s, it should fall to 6 million from the current 6.87 million. By the end of the century, according to the mid-range demographic projection from 2023, the number of working-age people will decrease to 5.39 million ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 14).</p><p> In addition to these numbers, the projections also indicate the share of the working-age population in the total population ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 11, <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 14). This value is crucial for the state of the pension system, as it shows how large a part of society will be able <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/myty-fakta-duchody#:~:text=FAKT%3A%20LID%C3%89%20V,na%20d%C5%AFchodov%C3%A9%20poji%C5%A1t%C4%9Bn%C3%AD\">to earn</a> on pensions. The projections from 2018 ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 11) and 2023 ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 14) assume that the share of the working-age population will decline, especially in the next 40 years, but the individual documents mention slightly different figures.</p><p> As can be seen in the graph below, for the period 2031–2071, the newer projection shows a higher share of the population of working age than the previous CZSO projection. <i>&quot;From the perspective of the pension system&quot;</i> , which Marian Jurečka is talking about, the newer projection for the next 50 years shows better results than the projection from 2018. The new projection assumes worse numbers compared to the older one only in the years 2081–2101. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" data-external=\"1\" height=\"379\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NoOr3/1/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-NoOr3\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" title=\"Proportion of working-age population\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> <strong>Birth rate, fertility</strong></p><p> The birth rate <a href=\"https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~mak/gos/demmetodika/www.czso.cz/cz/cisla/0/02/020100/narozeni.htm#:~:text=Po%C4%8Det%20%C5%BEiv%C4%9B%20narozen%C3%BDch%20d%C4%9Bt%C3%AD%2C%20p%C5%99ipadaj%C3%ADc%C3%AD%20na%201000%20obyvatel%20st%C5%99edn%C3%ADho%20stavu.\">indicates</a> the number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants. The fertility rate makes this figure <a href=\"https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Porodnost\">more precise</a> by expressing the number of these children per thousand women of reproductive age. Statistics also calculate it directly by age (e.g. for women aged 20, 21, etc.). The sum of fertility rates for all age groups (divided by a thousand) expresses the intensity of fertility in the population and indicates the average number of live births per woman, the so-called total fertility.</p><p> Total fertility is an indicator that is <a href=\"https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Porodnost\">suitable</a> , for example, for international comparison. A value of 2.1 children per woman is generally considered sufficient to prevent population decline. If the value falls below 2.1, the population decreases in the long term, and vice versa. In his statement, Marian Jurečka is clearly confusing the terms total fertility and birth rate. According to the latest data from the Czech Statistical Office, the birth rate in 2023 reached about 8.4 per thousand ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/d5c66500-c681-32b9-907d-4158ccceefb9/13006924.pdf?version=1.1\">.pdf</a> , pp. 5, 36). This is therefore a completely different figure than the one Minister Jurečka is talking about.</p><p> According to CZSO data, fertility fell significantly in the 1990s, then rose again in the first two decades of the 21st century ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 2) and remained at 1.71 between 2018 and 2020. A year later, it even increased to 1.83. Then, however, there was a decline - in 2022 to 1.62 and in 2023 to <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/narozeni?pocet=10&amp;start=0&amp;podskupiny=133&amp;razeni=-datumVydani\">1.45 children</a> per woman.</p><p> The CZSO projection from November 2023, based on the current data at that time, estimated that the total fertility rate for 2023 would be 1.5 children per woman ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 2). In the middle, most likely variant of the CZSO projection, the CZSO assumes that fertility will reach the same value in the following years (p. 3). In contrast, the previous projection from 2018 assumed a gradual stabilization at 1.74 children per woman ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 2).</p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) summarizes the conclusions of the Czech Statistical Office regarding the three aforementioned indicators – life expectancy, the number of people of working age and total fertility, which he confuses with the term <i>“birth rate”</i> . He correctly states that according to the Czech Statistical Office’s projection from 2023, life expectancy will increase, the number of people of working age will decrease and total fertility will stabilize at 1.5 children per woman.</p><p> In the statement, however, it primarily compares the CZSO projections from 2023 and 2018 and says that the newer document assumes worse results <i>&quot;from the perspective of the pension system&quot;</i> than the previous estimates. Compared to the older one, the newest projection does indeed assume a faster decline in the fertility rate and a slightly higher increase in life expectancy. In the key category of the share of the population in the working age group, however, the 2023 projection shows worse results only for the last 20 years of this century, while for the years 2031–2071 (i.e. for the next 50 years) it assumes better development than the older projection. We therefore assess the statement as misleading.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) is responding to criticism from ANO MP Klára Dostálová, who commented in the debate on the government&#39;s poor communication regarding the planned adjustment of the parameters for regular pension valorization. According to MP Dostálová, Marian Jurečka wants to submit this change too quickly, which is why there will be no time for thorough discussions with the opposition. The head of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs responded by saying that he is not going to submit the amendment in the near future, and noted that he has previously objected to such information.</p><p> <strong>Statement on the negotiations in the week of March 20-26</strong></p><p> First of all, let us mention that the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MLSA) Eva Davidová <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230327123710/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2340047\">told</a> ČTK on Friday, March 17, 2023, that the government could discuss the amendment that would amend the rules for pension valorization as early as the week of March 20-26. Eva Davidová also expressed the same opinion on <a href=\"https://cnn.iprima.cz/porady/zpravy/17032023-0\">CNN Prima News</a> (video, 13:54–15:00). Among other things, she stated that she expected the proposal to be <i>&quot;approved by the government during the next week&quot;</i> (video, 14:54).</p><p> Later that same day, however, Marian Jurečka <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-zmeny-valorizaci-penzi-nejsou-na-poradu-dne-jurecka-slibil-standardni-legislativni-proces-40426160\">announced</a> that Petr Fiala&#39;s cabinet <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572522-jurecka-chce-v-pristich-tydnech-jednat-o-zmene-valorizace-duchodu-s-opozici-i-odbory\">would not</a> discuss such a proposal in the aforementioned week.

Let us add that Marian Jurečka also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3573198-jurecka-s-opozici-jedna-o-dalsim-zpomaleni-rustu-penzi-dohoda-je-ale-v-nedohlednu\">wants</a> to reduce the benefits of early retirement.</p><p> Marian Jurečka then <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-fiala-spd-po-jednani-s-jureckou-odmitame-snizeni-realnych-duchodu-40426514?fbclid=IwAR05IcQiNxPhTmXIzrFhjmPRUyeRj5nSNB6rbL5ivn8J5wiDUSOjS1V-aJM#source=hp&amp;seq_no=10&amp;dop_ab_variant=0&amp;dop_source_zone_name=novinky.sznhp.box&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_medium=z-boxiku&amp;utm_source=www.seznam.cz\">met</a> with SPD representatives on March 22.

It often sends these really important materials late and denies its own words.&quot;</i></p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Spokesperson for the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs Eva Davidová told ČTK on Friday, March 17, that Petr Fiala&#39;s government is preparing to discuss the proposal for changing the rules for valorization of pensions in the week from March 20 to 26. Later that same day, however, Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka said that the cabinet would not discuss the proposal in that week. According to him, negotiations with representatives of the opposition, unions and employers should first take place and only then should the proposal be sent to the commenting office. Only then should the government discuss possible changes to the valorization.</p><p> A similar situation occurred in the case of the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs that the government would approve the adjustment of valorizations at the beginning of April. Marian Jurečka actually wrote on Twitter under Alena Schillerová&#39;s post that the proposal would first be discussed with the opposition and other partners. For these reasons, we assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>Following its meeting on April 27, 2022, the government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-prodiskutovala-tzv--balicek-rodinne-pomoci--schvalila-i-pomoc-socialnim-sluzbam-s-pokrytim-zvysenych-nakladu-na-peci-o-uprchliky-195891/\">announced</a> a set of measures at a press conference to help families with children cope with high inflation and rising energy prices.

The ANO movement is currently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqIebm42vdI\">working</a> (video) on a complaint (or <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p64-1\">a proposal</a> to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl87-1-a\">repeal</a> the law) with which it wants to challenge the amendment to the Pension Valorization Act. The SPD movement also wants <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572040-na-ustavni-soud-se-opozice-obrati-jakmile-zmena-valorizace-duchodu-vyjde-ve-sbirce\">to join</a> the submission.</p><p> Let us mention that due to the newly adopted amendment to the law, which was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu\">signed by</a> President Petr Pavel, during the extraordinary valorization of pensions in June, pensions <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">will increase</a> on average by only CZK 760 ( <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/\">.doc</a> , p. 1). According to the previously valid <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22604\">rules</a> , the average pension should have increased by <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/starobni-duchod/439182-zvyseni-duchodu-v-cervnu-spocitejte-si-rozdil-valorizace\">CZK 1,770</a> .

The government now expects that pension spending will increase by only CZK 15 billion ( <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/\">.doc</a> , p. 5–6).</p><p> The opposition <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu\">cites</a> several reasons for submitting the proposal to the Constitutional Court. The first is the so-called <a href=\"https://cit.vfu.cz/ppoz/okruhypdf/1pravnipredpisyzakladnipojmyadruhypravnichpredpisu.pdf\">retroactivity</a> (.pdf, pp. 2–3), or retroactive effect. The opposition movement <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">claims</a> that in the case of the amendment, the change in the legal regulation was approved only after the valorization <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-3\">mechanism</a> was launched. &quot; <i>We believe that it was created on January 31,&quot;</i> Alena Schillerová <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">justifies</a> retroactivity as one of the pillars of the prepared proposal, because the amendment only entered into <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">force</a> after the aforementioned date, specifically March 20, 2023.</p><p> The second reason for submitting a motion to repeal the amendment <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">is</a> the state of legislative emergency declared by the government, due to which the submitted government proposal <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=314\">is being discussed</a> in an abbreviated session. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#f1609384\">Act</a> No. 90/1995 Coll., on the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies, such a state can <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#p99-1\">be declared</a> in an extraordinary moment &quot; <i>when the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens or the security of the state are fundamentally threatened or when the state is threatened with significant economic damage</i> &quot;. The opposition wants to refute the government&#39;s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230403130212/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2329976\">argument</a> that the state of legislative emergency was declared precisely because of the risk of &quot;major economic damage&quot;, as it <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">believes</a> that this was unjustified.</p><p> Opposition parties <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">can</a> submit a proposal from March 20, when the amendment <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">was published</a> in <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392\">the Collection of Laws</a> . According to the chairwoman of the ANO parliamentary group, Alena Schillerová, the proposal could <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">reach</a> the Constitutional Court in early May. The movement&#39;s deputy chairman, Radek Vondráček, <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">said</a> on March 19 that this could happen within a month.</p><p> After considering the proposal, the Constitutional Court then <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p70-1\">decides</a> whether the law or its individual provisions are in conflict with the Constitution. If the constitutional order has been violated, the court may annul the law in question (in this case, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392\">the amendment</a> to the Act on Lower Pension Valorization) and order the relevant state body to restore the situation prior to the violation of the Constitution. However, in the past, although the Constitutional Court did not consider a decision to be unconstitutional, it published <i>an obiter dictum</i> , which is <a href=\"https://www.ceska-justice.cz/2020/04/praha-7-ustavni-stiznost-kvuli-koronavirovym-opatrenim-nestahne-jde-nam-judikat-budoucna-tvrdi-starosta-i-pravnici/\">a non-authoritative</a> statement beyond the basic reasoning ( <a href=\"https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 11).</p><p> <strong>Finding to declare a state of emergency</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka mentions the case law when the Constitutional Court found doubts about the method of extending the state of emergency. This <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ustavni-soud-zamitl-zadost-senatoru-unor-nouzovy-stav_2103251028_btk\">happened,</a> for example, in March 2021. At that time, the Constitutional Court was considering a proposal by a group of senators to annul the resolution <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2018-cr/andrej-babis-ii/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-27-6-2018-trva-175411/\">of the government of</a> Andrej Babiš (ANO) due to the declaration of a state of emergency at the request of the governors, which occurred immediately after the proposal to extend the previous state of emergency was not passed<a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koronavirus-v-cesku-nouzovy-stav-senat_2102171308_pj\">by the Chamber of Deputies</a> .</p><p> The Constitutional Court rejected the proposal ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 1) stating that it was not within its competence to decide on such a proposal (.pdf, p. 7. 12). However, as <i>an obiter dictum</i> , it stated ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 7) that &quot; <i>a state of emergency cannot be &#39;newly&#39; declared by the government from the moment the &#39;authorized&#39; state of emergency has ended and the Chamber of Deputies has not agreed to its extension</i> &quot;. As part of <i>the obiter dictum</i> , the Constitutional Court can therefore submit a non-binding statement ( <a href=\"https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 11) or a recommendation for the legislative process.</p><p> Let us add that in the debate with Minister Jurečka, the moderator asked about option B in the event that the Constitutional Court &quot;swept away&quot; the amendment, that is, if it recognized it as unconstitutional, and thus ordered the government to restore the status quo before the violation of the constitutional system. In such a case, the situation described by Marian Jurečka, that the Constitutional Court would <i>not &quot;change the essence&quot;</i> of the amendment, would not occur. Since the decisions of the Constitutional Court are <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/postaveni-a-pravomoci\">binding</a> , <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">the amended</a> law would have to return to its original form.</p><p> <strong>Finding on the amendment to the pandemic law</strong></p><p> In 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf\">.pdf</a> ) in a similar case, where a group of deputies led by Radek Vondráček (ANO) challenged <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=127\">the use of</a> a state of legislative emergency to discuss <a href=\"http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2022-39\">an amendment to</a> the pandemic law (Law No. 39/2022 Coll.) at the beginning of 2022. In September 2022, the Constitutional Court rejected the proposal of the opposition deputies ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 1), but in its ruling it stated (p. 24) that <i>&quot;the process leading to the adoption of Law No. 39/2022 Coll. cannot be considered - at a sub-constitutional level - to be flawless&quot;</i> and noted in passing that <i>&quot;the legislative process under review and its course can be considered a reflection of the current political culture, the state of which is characterized, among other things, by numerous obstructionist negotiations, the chaotic agenda and course of meetings, as well as the inflexibility of the legislative process&quot;.</i></p><p> <strong>Final evaluation</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka truthfully states that in the past, when rejecting proposals to repeal a law, the Constitutional Court used non-binding statements, so-called obiter dictums, in which it found, for example, doubts in the legislative process. For this reason, we assess the statement as true.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A."
