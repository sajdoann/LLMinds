    "What is the scientifically supported explanation for solar eclipses, and how does it compare to the explanations for lunar eclipses?",
    "How do historical and observational records challenge the conventional explanation that Earthâ€™s shadow causes lunar eclipses?",
    "What are some observable phenomena during lunar eclipses that cast doubt on the shadow-based explanation of their cause?",
    "How do eyewitness accounts and visual observations during eclipses support or oppose the prevailing scientific explanations?",
    "How does the observed brightness and appearance of the Moon during totality challenge the traditional understanding of lunar eclipses as merely caused by Earth's shadow?",
    "What logical or observational inconsistencies arise when assuming the Earth's shadow is the cause of lunar eclipses, given the visibility of the Moon above the horizon during such events?",
    "How does the comparison between a silvered glass ball or globe and the Moon's surface contribute to the argument about the Moon's reflective properties?",
    "What evidence is presented to suggest that the Moon might be self-luminous rather than reflecting the Sun's light, and why is this view significant?",
    "What are the differences between the effects of the Sun's and Moon's light on chemical substances and physical objects, and what do these differences imply about the nature of lunar illumination?",
    "What conclusions can be drawn from experiments that concentrated the Moon's light about its temperature and luminous properties, and how do these results challenge the reflection theory?",
    "What evidence supports the existence of a large, non-luminous body orbiting the Earth?",
    "Why do astronomical tables remain useful regardless of the underlying theories, and how do they contribute to the study of celestial events?",
