    "What was the major development in machine translation that led to the entire research field shifting towards neural machine translation systems?",
    "What was the major recent development in statistical machine translation that led to a shift away from traditional statistical machine translation systems and towards neural machine translation approaches?",
    "What were the key milestones in the development of neural machine translation systems, including the pioneering work by Schwenk (2007), and how did they contribute to the eventual dominance of neural machine translation in the field?"
