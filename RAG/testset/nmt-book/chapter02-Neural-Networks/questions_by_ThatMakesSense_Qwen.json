    "What is the process for computing the derivative of the error with respect to the weights during back-propagation, and how does the chain rule apply to decompose this derivative?",
    "What is the role of the chain rule in back-propagation, and how is the error term for a hidden node computed based on the error terms of subsequent nodes?"
