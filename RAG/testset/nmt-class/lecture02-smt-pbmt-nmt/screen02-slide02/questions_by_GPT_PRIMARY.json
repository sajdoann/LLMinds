    "What are the key properties that define a translation system as statistical, and how do these properties influence the system's functioning?",
    "How does phrase-based translation differ from neural machine translation, and what implications does this have for translation quality and system design?",
    "Why does the triangle of machine translation illustrate the potential advantages of abstract analysis over direct translation approaches?",
    "What challenges arise from the idea that deeper analysis in machine translation systems can lead to error accumulation, and how does this impact system design?",
    "In what ways do statistical and rule-based translation systems complement each other in hybrid approaches, and what benefits does such integration provide?"
