 Okay, so what does make machine translation statistical? So statistical in the information theoretic sense, you need to specify a probabilistic model. So you need to have, you need to distribute the mass of probability that you have among the possible outputs of your system. And then you need to specify how to train these tables of probabilities of events. Yeah, the linguistics is helpful here when designing the models. So when you have longer units such as sentences, linguists can give you some ideas how to break them into smaller units. And they will also tell you where you should primarily look at what are the important observations that the system should take into account when deciding what is what is more probable. Yeah, so that's that's.
