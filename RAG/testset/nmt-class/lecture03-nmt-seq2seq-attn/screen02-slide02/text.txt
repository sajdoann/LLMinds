 Okay, so for today, we're first need to briefly review basic building blocks of neural networks and then we'll talk about processing text in neural networks and then we'll move to a new language model and then finally the vanilla sequence to sequence architecture and we'll continue with the attention which is a critical concept. Many of these slides are based on a tutorial that and we had three years ago.
