    "Why are early parameters in a deep neural network prone to not changing during training?",
    "What happens if the updates from backpropagation go through nonlinearity backwards at every step?",
    "Why might numerical errors cause issues with training in early layers of a deep neural network?",
    "What problem is caused when nonlinearity goes through every step in a deep neural network during backpropagation?"
