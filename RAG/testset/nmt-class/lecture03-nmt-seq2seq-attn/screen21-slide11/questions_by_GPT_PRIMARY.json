    "What innovations have enabled deeper neural networks to train effectively, specifically regarding the development of LSTMs and GRUs?",
    "How does the previous state and current input contribute to the output in recurrent neural networks like GRUs?",
    "What challenges are associated with selective copying or destination selection of information in neural nodes, and how are they addressed?",
    "What is the significance of choosing which previous values to preserve in sequence models like GRUs?",
    "How does the gating mechanism in GRUs decide the proportion of old versus new information to be integrated into the current state?",
    "Why are two different nonlinear functions—tanh and sigmoid—used within GRUs, and what roles do they serve?"
