 Representation is there is no measurable, no useful similarity between words. So if you have a word which is kitten, the word kitten is equally, it is not cat, so it doesn't match this vector, but it is equally dissimilar with is as it is dissimilar with cat and as it is dissimilar with mad and the. So the lack of similar or measurable, reasonably measurable similarity between words is something which makes the the computation too crude and and not not robust to small changes in the input. If you have if some dense representation where the words are represented with fewer numbers but larger set of numbers than just 0 and 1 then the. and the. So the system is. Going to happily reuse use the translation for cat instead of kitten and it will it will not consider using the translation of on instead of. because on is too far too far from kitten.
