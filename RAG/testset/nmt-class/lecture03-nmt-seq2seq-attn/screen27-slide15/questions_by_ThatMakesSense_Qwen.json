    "What do the embeddings capture in the context of the tasks they are trained for?",
    "What is the reason that using embeddings for different downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis or politeness detection, leads to different trained values of the embeddings?",
    "How do the features captured by embeddings change depending on the specific task the neural network is trained for?"
