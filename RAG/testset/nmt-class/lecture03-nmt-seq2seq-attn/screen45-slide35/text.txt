 So the true distribution at every time stamp would reflect what are the probabilities of all the words given all the possible formulations of the target sentence. Our parral corpora for a given input sentence do not contain the set of all possible translations. We'll talk about the set of all possible translations in other lectures as well. The set of all possible translations are. What we have is just one expected reference translation and not all the many. So the true distribution of what all output words are possible at this time step are unknown. We cannot get them reasonably. So we define these output distributions very simply. We will say that this output distribution is set to 1 for the word which was seen at this position in the training data and for 0 to to all other candidate tokens. So this is a very peaked distribution. It is not nice. It just tells you this is the word that you were expected to produce. Whatever other word you have produced you are not getting any score for that. It is like ugly from...
