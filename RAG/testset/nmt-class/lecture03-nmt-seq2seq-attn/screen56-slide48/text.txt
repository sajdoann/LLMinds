 with the recurrent language models here with neural networks. The predictions of individual positions are not so bad. So you can survive, you can produce decent output even if you do the greedy decoding and always take the best option. Yeah, so even it even happens that neural networks if you use a beam search and increase the beam size they will produce worse sentences because more candidates are considered and so there is the this this is related to the suboptimal training because the networks are trained to memorize the parallel corpus and not to not to understand the sentence represent the sentence adequately and and represent the set of paraphrases jointly for example. So that's
