    "What is a potential solution to the problem of the decoder forgetting the original input sentence in a sequence-to-sequence model?",
    "What is a potential approach to mitigate the \"fabulation\" problem in the decoder, where it forgets the original input and produces nonsensical words towards the end of the sentence?",
    "What approach helped in early implementations to improve the representation of the input sentence in the decoder state, but still resulted in \"fabulation\" towards the end of the sentence?"
