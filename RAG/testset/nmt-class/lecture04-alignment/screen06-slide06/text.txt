 That's that source. So here's the composition of the data and in sum we obtained about 1.4 million sentence pairs and in number of tokens in one of the languages it was about 21 million tokens. So you see that the legal texts were more than or almost two-thirds of the data and then the stories were like 8% for the news comment, 8% for the Reader's Digest 7% for the news commentaries. The community supplied localization texts were quite substantial or 11% in total in terms of sentences but they were very small less than 2% in terms of words. So that just highlights that the domain of these translations was not good for translating normal long sentences. Uh
