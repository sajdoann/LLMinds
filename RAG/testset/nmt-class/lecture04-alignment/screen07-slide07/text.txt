 So let me focus a little bit on the community translations. The Navajo project was the anonymous corrections of machine translated Wikipedia. As you know Wikipedia is very or Wikipedia are very picky about what gets to the Wikipedia itself. So it was not allowed to be part of Wikipedia. It was like a totally separate web page so not many people learned about it and but still it was getting some attention and about 2000 segments were corrected every month. So we manually evaluated some of those and the result was quite promising. So about 70% were precise and flawless translations and about 5% more were also like reasonably good translations. And there were some sentences 7% which were not translated also people just open it and click yes without doing any edits. some of them are partial and some were imprecise and some were generated by other machine translation systems and the vandalism level was pretty low below 3% and that's that's good. So if we would be able to separate the good translations from the bad translations which is a difficult exercise on its own then it would be possible to obtain about 75% of that volume into the data collection.
