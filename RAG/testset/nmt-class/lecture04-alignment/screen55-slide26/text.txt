 So here a little bit of more formulas that are behind that simplified slide that we have just seen. So we need to compute the IBM model one alignment. So that is the alignment. So we need to compute in order to be able to estimate the fractional counts. we need to know how likely is the alignment given the source and target sentences. So we need to know the probability of the alignment given the source and target sentences among all the possible alignments between the source and target sentences. And we can apply the chain rule for this probability which gives us this fraction. The numerator is the alignment is the definition of the IBM model one. of the target sentence and the alignment given the source. And this is the probability of the target sentence given the source regardless the alignment. So this is like if we consider all the possible alignments. So let's let's.
