    "**Factors influencing the trustworthiness of alignment points:**\n1. **Alignment Probabilities:** The likelihood of each alignment point is determined by the alignment matrix, which represents the probability of each word in the source sentence aligning with each word in the target sentence.\n2. **Lexical Translation Probabilities:** The trustworthiness is influenced by the lexical probabilities, which are derived from the alignment matrix and refined through iterative processes.\n3. **Chain Rule Application:** The chain rule is used to calculate the probability of the entire alignment by multiplying the individual alignment probabilities.\n4. **All Possible Alignments:** The method considers all possible alignments between the source and target sentences, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation.\n5. **Tractability Through Normalization:** The computation becomes manageable due to the cancellation of normalizations, allowing for efficient product and sum operations after division.\n\nThese factors collectively determine the trustworthiness of alignment points in the IBM Model 1.",
