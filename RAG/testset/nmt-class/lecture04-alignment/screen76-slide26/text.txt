 These days the alignments are used in two directions. So you align English to Spanish and you align Spanish to English. Remember each of those is a function so each of them allows only one to many or many to one alignment points and then you multiply then you put them together either with intersection or union and it turned out that for if you want to extract some parallel dictionary if you want to extract some dictionary for humans you want the reliable link so you rely on the intersection if you want to extract phrase translations for the phrase based empty that will be discussed in the upcoming lecture then you do something between the intersection and union which was called to grow dive final so one particular heuristic how to how to enlarge the intersection but not get the the fully union yet and there were also like principled algorithms that that use optimizations like minimum edge cover. So
