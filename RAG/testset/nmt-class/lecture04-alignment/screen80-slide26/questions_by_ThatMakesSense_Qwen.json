    "What are the two main types of alignment issues discussed in the text when aligning English and Chinese, and how are they characterized?",
    "The two types of alignment problems mentioned in the text are:\n1. **Missing Counterparts**: 96% of alignment points in English definitions have no counterpart in Chinese, making such alignments a bad question.\n2. **Non-Lexical Equivalents**: Role-equivalent pairs that are not direct lexical translations, such as \"was\" in English not being a direct translation of the Chinese passive marker, leading to alignment issues despite superficial similarity."
