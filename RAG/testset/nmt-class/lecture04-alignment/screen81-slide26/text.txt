 So here is a similar observation that we made a few years before that for Czech. Again, the sentence is full of various auxiliary words. I do not think their customers would like it very much. Nemyslím, že by se to jich zákazníku moc líbilo. This word nemyslím corresponds primarily to this thing, but it also includes the meaning of I do not. So this single Czech word this word corresponds to one, two, three, four English words in some way, and only one of them is the lexical translation and the other are elements of English word that contribute to the meaning in some way. So the interesting thing that happened here was that in that year two papers annotated the same test set with like totally independently without knowing each other. and we realized, oh, we were doing double annotation, they were doing single annotation, so we realized we have a three-way annotation of the same data set. So did we do it the same way? And the great observation was, yes, we both, the two groups independently, defined the same rules for the annotators. So we ended up with a three-way annotation just because the linguistic of both these groups was the same. So that's the good news. If there is a theory, an established theory, that is shared in some community of people, then two groups can do the same task without knowing of each other.
