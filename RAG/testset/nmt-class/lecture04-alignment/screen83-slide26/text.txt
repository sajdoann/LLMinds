 improve for the machine. So that's what my colleague did some years ago. He was aligning texogrammonical nodes instead of words. Auxiliaries words didn't clutter the task and it improved the task as such improved the alignment, the human agreement on the task. The application to phrase-based MT was done some years after that and there were indeed little improvements. But the main was to extract a dictionary for a deep syntactic machine translation system. And the main observation was that this is a better defined task. So that was the good side. We were able to redefine the task so that it makes more sense and it's easier than to automate. But there is a disadvantage, there is a cost. It becomes language dependent. You need to define this texogrammatic layer for all the and you have to rely on complex tools to get to the annotation in the first place.
