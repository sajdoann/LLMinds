 Yeah, so the translation, the reason for quadratic complexity is the reordering and if we limit the reordering, if we allow to expand hypothesis only close to the currently translated one, then the number of considered translation options is not as many as there is the length of the sentence. not as a plural but again a constant number so then the whole search reduces to the linear complexity. We have the max text size and the sentence length and that's it.
