    "How does the allocation of partial hypotheses into stacks potentially create unfair competition between hypotheses covering the same number of source words?",
    "Why is it problematic to prune hypotheses purely based on the score so far during translation, especially when considering the sequence of translating easy versus hard parts?",
    "What is the role of the heuristic function in the A* search algorithm as applied to translation hypotheses, and how does it influence the fairness of the search process?",
    "How does considering only the translation of individual phrases contribute to estimating the future cost in the translation process?",
    "Why is ignoring the reordering cost and boundary effects considered an optimistic estimate in the future cost calculation, and what are the implications of this assumption?"
