 So one thing is still not quite fair in this allocation of partial hypothesis into stacks. And the not fair thing is that you can have two hypotheses that cover the same number of source words. So they compete on the same stack. But one of them does the easy part first and one of them does the hard part of the sentence.Ã©n LG react the Process 1 1. Because in the end of the hypothesis, which now has been doing the the easy part will still have to translate the hard words and the hypothesis, which is now doing the hard part of the sentence, will still have the chance to recover the score by doing the easy part after that, because the easy part is still to be to be there. is still to be covered. So, if we prune based on the score so far, the cost based so far, we would probably drop the hypothesis which translates the hard part of the sentence first. And that is not fair because later on it will have a chance to recover its score. So, there is one more score component that is considered. is very similar to the to the or it's identical actually to the to the heuristic in the A star search algorithm. So the heuristic is a function which estimates how much you will have to pay to get to the to the end to the final point in the future anyway. So this is this is the future cost estimate and this future cost estimate when considered for these easy first or hard first hypothesis will the comparison fair. So I said that the easy easy first hypothesis the hypothesis which translates the easy first easy words first will still have to translate the hard words so it will have a higher future cost estimate and the other one the hypothesis which first translates the hard words will have a lower future cost estimate because it will later be translating only the easy words. Yeah so here the example is the tourism initiative addresses this for the first time and the tourism initiative is a pretty rare thing so it would be hard to translate the first time is something which is easy to easy to translate so based on these scores without future estimation cost then this translation of the first time seems higher scoring. So the system would keep this one on the stack and it would prune the the monotone translation and that is something which we do not want. So the system would keep this one on the stack and it would be hard to do something which we do not want.
