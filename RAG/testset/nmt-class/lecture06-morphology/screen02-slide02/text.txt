 So I'm Czech and that's maybe the main reason why I'm so focused on morphology because Czech is a flective language and it's highly complex and we'll see some examples of that and when we are translating into Czech we need to deal with this rich morphology. So in the lecture today we'll first talk about the problems caused by rich morphology then we'll illustrate the combinatorial explosion that happens in Czech machine translation, specifically the phrase-based machine translation and how that deals with morphology. And then we'll also move to Neural MT and discuss how rich morphology is solved by Neural MT.
