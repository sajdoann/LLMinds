 There is also morphological explosion in other languages. In German words are put together. So this Rindfleisch etikettierung und Überwachung aufstrahber und übertreibung gesetz that was almost voted to be the word of the year. But the word millennium then won for some reason. So this this word is a law on beef labeling duty. so Germans are happy with that word written without any spaces. If you have to translate this word you have to break it into small pieces. And if you are expected to produce these words you have to really be clever in your system so that you so that you can mimic what what Germans normally do. The agglutination is not compounding. That's another phenomenon and in a word formation. In agglutination the is the same, but you are using many suffixes, prefixes, infixes and other modifications of the word form so that you express some variations of that meaning. So I don't speak Finnish or Hungarian, but I found somewhere that this istua is to sit down and with some prefixes and suffixes you can make, you can create a single word which has the meaning I wonder if I should sit down for a while.
