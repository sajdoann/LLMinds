 So when you are translating into such a morphologically rich language and you use some simple the baseline machine translation evaluation method such as the BLEU score that we discussed, then this method will focus only on the word forms, whether you have generated the right word forms. And obviously if you make any error in the ending, then you do not get the credit so that suddenly the whole word is counted as wrong. This reflects in the in the generally lower that you are getting for morphological rich languages compared to English. And also if we would ignore the problems in morphology, the scores would would jump higher. So put in other words, if we ensure that our systems produce perfect word forms, they always make the right choice. The BLEU scores could increase up to eight points, for example. That was back then in the phrase based machine translation era.
