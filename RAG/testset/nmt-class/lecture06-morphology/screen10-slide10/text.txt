 For a speaker it's better to highlight the problem with the morphological text. So these are very simplified morphological text. The first example, dvou zelená pruhovány kočká, the garbage thing, is visible for you because now the labels, the morphological text, are distinct for each word there is a different morphological text. And if those words were agreeing together to form a noun phrase, then and there would be the same gender number and case used throughout that phrase. So that is the example of the second translation, dva zelené pruhovány kočky. Here one option is to understand this word dva and zelené as masculine nominative and the three words in row are an agreeing sequence of words. The second tripe, zelené pruhovány kočky, that is perfect feminine noun phrase, But there is no way to understand dva as a form of a feminine and there is no way to understand kočky as a masculine. So there is no way to put these two trigrams together to form a valid four-gram. Here is a phrase which has four words and that are agreeing. But I'm highlighting here the morphological ambiguity. The forms are dvě zelené pruchované kočky and you still don't know whether this is the nominative or the accusative case.
