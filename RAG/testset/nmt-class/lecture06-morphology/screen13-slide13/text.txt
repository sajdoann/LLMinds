 So now what was the proposed solution? And that is the extension of the phrase-based model. It's called the factored phrase-based model. And the idea is to separate the translation of the word itself from its morphology. So instead of translating directly the word form, we'll be translating the lemma to lemma and then the morphological tag to the morphological tag. And we end up with something which the final user doesn't like to see. by the factored lemma and morphological tag. But we can use some morphological module or a generation step in the system, as we'll see in a second, to figure out what is the correct form. And the benefit here is that this generation step can be trained independently of the parallel data. So this is something which can be extracted from just the monolingual corpus. And that will give you the benefit of producing even instrumental for kneecaps, something which was not available in normally sized parallel data.
