 For example, that was tested on English to Greek translation, a similar setup would work for Czech as well. On the source side, you analyze the sentence and you check whether a particle noun serves as a subject or serves as the object in the sentence. And this information, subject versus object, is a very good indication to whether it should be translated as nominative or accusative in the target language. Teller now, probe the previous translation table as soon as La semilla labeling, so here the translation table, the mapping table from the role or function of the word in the sentence in English into the case in the target Greek. That will contain mappings like subject goes to nominative an object goes to accusative. There can be against swaps, changes in the case, but the data will have sufficient statistics for that across all the visible, across all the nouns and all the subjects and all the objects in the data. It is not learning that for each individual word form.
