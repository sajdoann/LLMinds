 So the technical way how to do this is again use alternative decoding paths for the reverse step and instead of translating only form to form, kočce into something unknown, we can resort to translation of the Czech lemma, kočka, to the English form. So it is then like making up the English side a little. It is guessing the form of the English word, but English is morphologically poorer, so it's and you create the synthetic parallel data and you train on those. For other languages you would have to apply other linguistic expertise. So when you were doing this for English into German translation in the reverse translation step, you should split German compounds. And if you did this for Turkish, you should simplify Turkish by dropping Turkish morphology in a way that is appropriate for Turkish, not just this. So there was. Uh. Yeah. It is. It is. So it is. Yeah, it is. Yeah. It is. It is. Yeah. militaristic organization. It is. Yeah. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is giga certain. It is. But can we all go in this model 1993? least things is, of course, this model remote politicization? Yes. Oh yes. To and忘ulization. It is. It is. It is. It is. It just comes. It is.
