    "**Question:** What is the reason that the example provided was considered linguistically inadequate, and how does the added syntactic information from true syntactic trees complicate the parsing process?",
    "Question: Explain why the initial example of machine translation using bottom-up parsing was linguistically inadequate and how the addition of syntactic information, as discussed in the slides by David Cheng, complicates the parsing process.",
    "The example used for bottom-up parsing in machine translation was linguistically inadequate because it lacked proper syntax, relying only on a hierarchical structure. The addition of syntactic information, such as labels assigned by linguists, complicates the parsing process, as illustrated in David Cheng's 2010 slides."
