 True syntax is hard. The reason is that you are losing some of the coverage of your rules by these additional constraints and you are not licensing the rules to be used. So, in short, syntactic approaches compared to the phrase-based approaches or the hierarchical approaches suffer from too few rules in your extracted rule tables and too few license derivations.
