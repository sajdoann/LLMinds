    "What problem arises in syntactic approaches to phrase-based MT when a translation like \"Brucha Verde\" to \"Green Witch\" is considered?",
    "The problem arises because \"Green Witch\" isn't a constituent in the target language's syntactic structure. In a syntactic approach, which relies on breaking down sentences into grammatical constituents, the phrase \"Green Witch\" cannot be properly integrated. This leads to translation issues, such as structural incompatibility or loss of meaning, as the phrase doesn't fit into the target language's syntax effectively.",
