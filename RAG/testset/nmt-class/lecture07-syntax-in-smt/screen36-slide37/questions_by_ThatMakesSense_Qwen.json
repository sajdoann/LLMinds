    "How does the dependency tree approach compare to n-grams in capturing word relationships, and what statistics support this?",
    "The text suggests that dependency trees effectively capture grammatical relationships in language processing, often connecting words that are adjacent, but also handling non-adjacent words through their structural dependencies. This approach is more efficient than n-grams, which rely on adjacency and require longer sequences to capture similar relationships.",
    "Question: Explain why dependency trees are more effective than n-grams in predicting lexical choices and grammatical categories, using the example of the words \"grass\" and \"cut,\" and discuss the statistics provided about edges in the Czech tree bank."
