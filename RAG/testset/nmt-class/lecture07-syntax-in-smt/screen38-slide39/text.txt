 The life is not as easy as it seems now. There are crossing brackets. So let's discuss the non-projectivity. What does happen in many sentences? It does happen in English as well, but it is much more common in Czech. Words are sometimes reordered in a way which does not allow to use the the hierarchical assumption anymore. So the idea of crossing brackets, when linguists talk about crossing brackets, then they mean the fact that a word appears outside of the subtree of the father, so to say. So if you have a sentence, Mary John loves, which is a topicalized sentence, where Mary is actually still the object of loving. So the original sentence, the normal word order is John loves Mary. But for some reason, it was pronounced differently. It was uttered as Mary John loves. The classical constituency tree for this sentence would be a little bit strange. It would say that the whole tree is like a topicalized sentence, S prime, and it consists of the topic, Mary, and then the normal sentence, where the normal grammatical sentence, is the normal grammatical rules for constituency tree supply. And that is this S goes to NP and VP, and that is the John loves, and then there is no Mary. So how to handle this? Linguists introduce traces. So traces are like co-indexed variables. And the idea is that this Mary kind of is here for the grammar. The grammar sees the Mary here, but the Mary has been put away by the stupid speaker of the language. So this movement out of the rule, this is like crossing bracket. This Mary has crossed the brackets of the VP. It was torn out from the father's span, and from the sentence father's span. It was moved out of the tree. That is the phenomenon of crossing brackets. Sometimes the crossing brackets are not apparent in dependency trees at all, because we don't have any non-terminals. So if you follow the trace of dependency heads within each of these constituents, then you suddenly realize that it's just differently ordered nodes. in Czech and other free word order languages, dependency trees have been more prominent, because we didn't have any troubles in representing sentences where the words were shuffled. And our grammar allows quite rich shuffling of elements. So dependency trees only indicate that Mary depends on the verb loves, and John also depends on that, and that's it.
