If you have a Dutch subordinate clause, so I was talking about something, so I was telling you that, that John, and in Dutch word order you would say, that John children saw swim. In English, the word order is that John saw children swim. But Dutch cross-serial dependencies prefer to have all the subjects first, and then all the the predicates. So this is the serial order of the subjects, John and children, and then the serial order of the predicates, who was doing what? John was seeing, children were swimming. And they are dependent on each other in the normal way. So it was children who were swimming, and it was John who saw. But you have to order them by the rules of Dutch syntax, as first all the subjects, and then all the subjects. So these are the cross-serial, crossing serial dependencies. So here we have the situation that in the subtree of swimming, there is the words children and swim. But these children and swim do not cover the whole contiguous part of the sentence. There is a gap in between. And the gap is here to populate the father of the sentence. So there is a sub-tree with a gap. And that's the non-projectivity. So you cannot project the nodes on the surface without creating gaps. If the tree, the dependency tree, has no gaps, then it is called a projective tree. And as such, it can be represented by a constituency-free grammar. If the tree has at most one gap, and one more property, well nestedness, there is another technical device, modelly context-sensitive grammar by Aravind Joshi. And that can handle it as well. But it is already beyond the context-free grammar. And that's why I said that context-free grammars are good for representing theren conhece and information. If is? I guess that context-free grammar by Aravind J L L R
