 Okay, so how severe is non-projectivity in Czech sentences? Not only Czech allows long gaps, because you can pump things into a gap, but also it allows many gaps. So here is a sentence, if I read it to you in Czech, you will not notice it would be any strange. The lexical choices in the sentence are so designed that it is clear that these have to be dependencies. This decided is in the past so it cannot be linked with the tomorrow and so on. So this way of this construction of having two verbs and their valency frames cross-serialized, like put together in this ugly order, that allows you to create many gaps. That is very common. Almost a quarter of Czech sentences contains this non-projectivity. But the good thing is that this crazy non-projectivity with many gaps is not that frequent. So 99.5% of Czech sentences are actually well nested and with at most one gap. So the mildly context-sensitive grammars would be sufficient for Czech.
