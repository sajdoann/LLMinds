 If you look at the tectogrammatical trees, they are structurally identical, they are isomorphic. There is this event of changing, there is this someone who should be changing things, and there is this something, the pronoun, that refers to what should be changed. This is actually the predicate argument structure of the sentence, if you want to write it in the bracketed format that was used in Prolog many years ago.
