 So in my approach I had this idea of the synchronous tree substitution grammars replacing the red subtree led with this smaller English subtree led. This is still the analytical surface syntax trees. I would decompose the input into tree leds. I would replace tree leds with their translations and then I would join these these tree leds to create the full tree.
