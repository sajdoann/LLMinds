 And here is the summary. I don't want to go into any of the details, but I used my single approach with its independence assumptions of the synchronous tree substitution grammars. And I used it either for the tectogrammatical trees, which are quite compact and have few nodes, but many attributes of each of the node, or with analytical trees that correspond to the tokens in the sentence. So there is more such nodes in the tree, so there are also auxiliaries. But the attributes are there are fewer attributes. And I also used something which can be dubbed the phrasal trees, that is like the analytical layer, except we ignore the structure and only attach the words to its predecessor. So this doesn't allow any reordering. This is like a very stupid phrase-based model without reordering. And in the empirical evaluation, unfortunately, it's all the same system here. It just uses different views of the sentence. The view which uses just the phrases and does not reorder them. Empirically comes out as the best approach. The second best is this approach, where there is some structure and the trees have to match across the sentences, subject to the sub-trees mapping. And the system which uses these tectogrammatical nodes with with many attributes, even with a very complex setup of creating these factors on the fly was still the worst. So...
