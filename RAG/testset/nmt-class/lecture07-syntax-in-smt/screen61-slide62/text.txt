 makes that approach unfortunate. So let me quickly go over an approach that used tectogrammatic layer and worked reasonably well. And that is the tecto-empty approach. It again follows the analysis transfer synthesis pipeline. So it's the transfer-based approach to machine translation. And it goes along the layers as we have briefly defined them. The morphological, analytical for shallow syntax and tectogrammatic. In practice,
