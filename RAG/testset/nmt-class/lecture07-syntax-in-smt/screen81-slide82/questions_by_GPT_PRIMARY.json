    "How does the concept of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) facilitate the process of selecting the most probable sequence of labels in linguistic translation?",
    "In what ways does translating from Czech to English benefit from the model's consideration of multiple translation options like 'PÅ™eklad' as 'translation' or 'arcade'?",
    "How does the influence of context alter the selection between different translations of words such as 'machine', 'arcade', and their combinations?",
