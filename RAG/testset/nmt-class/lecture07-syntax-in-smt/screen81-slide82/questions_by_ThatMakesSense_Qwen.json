    "What is the process used in the model to determine the optimal translation of a source sentence into the target language, considering the context and probabilities of word combinations?",
    "What is the main idea behind the described method for machine translation?",
    "The process described generalizes the Hidden Markov Model by using a tree structure instead of a linear sequence, where each node's translation choice is influenced by its context. It combines translation probabilities (emission) and language model probabilities (transition) in a bottom-up manner to find the optimal translation path."
