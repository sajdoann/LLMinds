    "How many layers of encoders and decoders are there in the original transformer model as described in the paper?",
    "**Answer:**  \nThe transformer model is designed with multiple layers of encoders and decoders, each playing a distinct role in processing and refining the input sentence. The encoders work to transform the input sentence into an intermediate representation, while the decoders progressively refine this representation to produce the final output. Specifically, the original paper suggests using six layers of encoders and six layers of decoders. Each decoder layer refines the output based on the previous layer's information, allowing for gradual improvements in predictions. Residual connections are employed to maintain the flow of information, enabling the network to skip layers if needed, which helps in training deeper networks effectively. Additionally, each decoder has access to the encoded information from the original input, allowing it to reconsider the context for more accurate predictions. The final representation of the sentence is flexible in length, accommodating varying input lengths, and this representation serves as the input for the decoder layers, which then produce the refined output through sequential processing."
