    "What is the process of creating word vectors in the transformer model, and how does subword processing play a role when the words are frequent enough to be used as full words?",
    "How does self-attention facilitate the flow of information between words in the transformer, and what is the significance of this ability?",
    "What is the role of the feedforward network in the transformer, and how does its token-based operation influence the processing of input data?",
    "How does the transformer architecture ensure that information from earlier layers and positions remains accessible during deep processing?",
    "In what ways does the capacity for the transformer to perform diverse transformations improve its effectiveness in language processing tasks?"
