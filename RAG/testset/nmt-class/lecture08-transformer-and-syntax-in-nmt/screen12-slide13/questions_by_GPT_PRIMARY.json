    "What is the role of the feedforward network in the transformer encoder, and how does it process information in the context of word transformations?",
    "How does the transformer model maintain and utilize positional information of words when processing sequences, despite applying identical transformations to each token?",
    "Why is self-attention considered a critical component in the transformer architecture, especially in the context of processing sequences?",
    "In what way does the transformer model facilitate information flow between tokens, and what is the significance of this capability?",
    "How does the application of the same transformation to each token in the transformer architecture affect the model's awareness of word positions, and how is this addressed?"
