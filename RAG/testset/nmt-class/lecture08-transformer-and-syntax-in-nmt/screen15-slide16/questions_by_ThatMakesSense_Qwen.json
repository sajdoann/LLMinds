    "What is the key trade-off between RNNs and CNNs when processing sequences, and how does each model handle it?",
    "What limitation of recurrent neural networks led to the exploration of alternative architectures such as convolutional neural networks?",
    "The trade-offs between using a fixed kernel size in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the self-attention mechanism in transformers involve the ability to capture long-range dependencies versus computational efficiency. CNNs, with their fixed kernel size, may struggle with capturing distant relationships as their receptive field is limited by the kernel size, potentially requiring deeper networks to achieve broader context. In contrast, transformers use self-attention, allowing them to consider all parts of the sequence simultaneously, dynamically adjusting importance and efficiently handling long sequences without the need for larger kernels or deeper layers. While transformers offer flexibility and efficiency in processing entire sequences in constant time, CNNs may be more computationally efficient for certain tasks due to their localized processing. Thus, the choice between the two depends on the application's need for handling sequence length and dependencies versus computational resource constraints."
