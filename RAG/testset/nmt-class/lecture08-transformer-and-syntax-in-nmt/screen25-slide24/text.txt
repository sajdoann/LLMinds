 and in the standard transform model you have eight heads but people try also many different numbers of those and each head is defined by the matrices that specify what are the keys what are the queries and what are the values so these trained matrices they are all initialized totally randomly but they will specialize in the process of training and some of the heads can focus on like what is the preceding word some of the heads can focus on what is my governor in the dependency bar some of the heads can focus on just the word itself like totally ignoring the rest and letting the the feed forward layer afterwards do the transformation so it's totally up to the network what what to do yeah so this is this is two heads for each of the heads you have the weight matrices which specify what the current token is is contributing to the key and what is it contributing to the value and
