 Another refinement specified or provided in the same paper changes the network structure yet a bit again and here the goal is to allow the information to flow not only from bottom up from the words to the top of the syntactic parts of the tree but also backwards so here at from every position you kind of run a long thread which goes up to the whole tree and then down back to the same back to the same node so every node can consider in the left to right bidirectional encoding it would consider all its predecessors and all its successors in this encoding it it considers all its governors in the constituency parts and then it brings the information from the governors back to the back to the node. So that gave some improvements especially for Chinese to English translation.
