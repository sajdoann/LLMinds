 Here is the CCG text just to illustrate them. The text is the subscript here and in the sentence which has the in at the end you have the requirement for preposition in that CCG text. So the CCG text uses slashes to specify that like to make me a valid verb I need to be complemented by a noun phrase from the right hand side. a propositional phrase from the left hand side and so on. So the CCG text specify to make me a fully saturated element in the sentence please provide these. So this is the valence information the word asks for complements and by knowing the tags the super text you know that you have to produce these additional elements in the sentence.
