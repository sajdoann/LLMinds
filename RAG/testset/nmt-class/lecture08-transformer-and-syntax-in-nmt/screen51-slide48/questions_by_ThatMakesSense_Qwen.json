    "How did the experiment modify the training objective to incorporate syntactic structure into the attention mechanism?",
    "What method was used to constrain the attention head in the transformer encoder to represent the syntactic dependency structure of the source sentence during training?",
    "The main objective of the experiment was to enhance the transformer model's ability to capture syntactic structures by incorporating dependency representations from the attention mechanism into the training process, thereby improving both translation quality and syntactic understanding."
