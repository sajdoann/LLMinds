    "How does the performance of the transformer model with a dummy diagonal parse compare to using the actual dependency parse in terms of translation quality?",
    "What role does the positioning of parse information within the layers of the transformer network play in translation quality?",
    "Why might peaked self-attention matrices, such as those encouraged by a diagonal parse, contribute to better translation outcomes?"
