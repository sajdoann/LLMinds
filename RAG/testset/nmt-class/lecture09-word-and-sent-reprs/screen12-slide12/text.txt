 evaluation setting. So do they really understand? I would like to highlight that there are some good reasons to think that they could understand. So the machine translation systems are trained on millions of documents and for example the system that I mentioned for English to Czech, the 2018 one, the Charles University Transformer setup, that was trained on such an amount of text that you would need 50 years to read it if you were reading eight hours that only 40% of this amount of text was actually parallel. The 60% was coming from the two languages and the system used an earlier version of itself to use that data. So that is one reason why the machine translation systems could be good, could understand. And the other reason is that we have talked about representation. So internally the neural network is creating some representation and these representations could correspond to some meaning of the sentence. So they could be meaningful. So let's test it. If you can speak Czech you can test it on our service. There is this 2018 system which...
