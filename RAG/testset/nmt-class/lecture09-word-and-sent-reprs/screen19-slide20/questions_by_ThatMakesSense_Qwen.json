    "What was the purpose of using three lines in the 2D space, and how does transforming the coordinates into a new ABC space based on distances from these lines help in separating inner points from circumference points?",
    "What does the transformation of coordinates into distances from three lines in the hidden layer allow the network to do, and why does this make it easier to classify points as either inner or on the circumference?",
    "What is the role of the hidden layer with three neurons in transforming the original 2D space into a new coordinate system for easier separation of inner and circumference points?"
