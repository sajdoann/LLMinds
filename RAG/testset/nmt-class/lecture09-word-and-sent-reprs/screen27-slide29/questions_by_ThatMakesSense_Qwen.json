    "What does subtracting the embedding of \"man\" from \"king\" and adding the embedding of \"woman\" result in, according to the text?",
    "What happens when you take the embedding of the word \"king,\" subtract the embedding of the word \"man,\" and add the embedding of the word \"woman\"?",
    "An example of a relation observed in the continuous space of word embeddings is the linear relationship where the embedding of \"king\" minus the embedding of \"man\" plus the embedding of \"woman\" results in the embedding of \"queen,\" demonstrating a form of gender-based analogy in the vector space."
