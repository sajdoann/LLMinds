 I would like to distinguish it from the linguistic meaning which captures the structure of expressions. So from the levels of linguistic description from morphology over syntax up to semantics this is the structuralist approach to the meaning of the sentence and there the idea can be clearly read in the Textogramalical Theory by Petrus Gall. So units of the lower layers of representation are put together to form units in the in the higher levels of the representation. So the linguistic meaning is at each of is defined at each of these levels in the like separately and it's defined by the by the relation to the surrounding layer.
