 So the meaning of the sentence has certain aspects that I try to list in an overview paper. And these aspects are sometimes better captured by the traditional symbolic theories of formal semantics. And sometimes they are better captured by the continuous representations of sentences that emerge when training neural empty systems. So when we talk about abstraction, so that we have like of objects and types of objects and classes of these types and so on, that's the abstraction. And that's often what symbolic theories are based on. The concept of nouns is very abstract. I'm not aware of much work, but maybe there is, on the abstraction in continuous representations. The compositionality is the critical element of symbolic representation. Maybe there is compositionality in continuous representations. The great benefit of continuous representations is that they are learnable. They emerge, as I said, when learning to do some tasks. So as a side effect, we get these representations. And when we have two sentences or two expressions and we want to relate them and we want to relate their meanings, in both cases, in symbolic theories, as well as continuous representations, you can do some processing, some calculation or algebraic calculation, the symbolic theories to express the difference. Then what is easily captured in the continuous representations is that the meanings are vague. If I say a sentence, I may not be precise enough. The sentence will never be specific enough to to fit to a single situation. It will always be applicable in many possible situations. And the meaning is never specified enough. So the meaning remains vague with respect to these individual situations. So that's easily captured in continuous representations. The ambiguity of expressions is better captured in symbolic theories. That was Danny approaching the chair with a bag. So there, in the continuous representations. There would be some differences in the activations. Whereas in the symbolic theories, you simply have two formulas that differ and that's it. And then also, there is something which I call statefulness. What the meaning should be attributed to the sentence as it is. Or whether the, of the first level of expression is more than a single representation, which is modified, which is modified in time, as some entity is processing that sentence. And continuous representations are in very good fit for that. Whereas symbolic theories have that aspect, but it was always cumbersome.
