 And here is an example in Czech, which we did a year later. And that's... we changed the way that these sentences were constructed because Czech allows for word reordering and we wanted to give the annotators the comfort of easily generating many word reorderings but validating them at the same time. So this single English sentence and even though he is a political veteran, the council Karel BÅ™ezina responded similarly. This single sentence received 70.000 translations and all of them are correct. So I'll read just a few of those. So if you are a Czech speaker, you will see that these sentences have obviously slightly different meanings but yes, there are all good translations of that input sentence. So the question is whether... If we call these Czech sentences paraphrases, will they be close to each other in the sentence embedding spaces? You see that on the surface, the sequence of words can be very different. So there are synonyms used but also the word reordering and the clauses within the sentence are shuffled in many ways. So the question is whether they will live in the same area in the sentence embedding space. And if you take the set, the manifold of this particular sentence, the English sentence, and you consider another English sentence, will the other English sentence, will the Czech counterparts of the other English sentence live in the same area and like too much conflict or too much interfere with the embeddings of the sentence? So how much entangled will be the manifolds of different sentences? So this is something that we are exploring. So this is something that we are exploring. So this is something that we are exploring.
