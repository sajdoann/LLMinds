 It's important to note that the baselines such as bag of words of using the glove embeddings are very good in these measures as well. So we have the centival evaluation that's the average accuracy is for the classification task. Centival average similarity is for the similarity based task and then the classification accuracy and here we are showing the COCO dataset that's the of the Davis-Bulden index and the clustering and neural networks. So according to these measures, infercent is excellent but the bag of words is also a very good way of representing sentences. And then we have our representations which emerge automatically when we train these neural network systems.
