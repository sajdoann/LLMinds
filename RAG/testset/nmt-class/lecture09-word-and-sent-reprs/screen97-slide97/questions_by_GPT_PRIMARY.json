    "How does the distribution of attention across different heads influence the way a neural network processes a sentence?",
    "Why might increasing the number of attention heads impair the performance of tasks requiring understanding of the whole sentence, such as polarity detection?",
    "What does the observed behavior of attention heads reveal about the depth and approach of neural processing in this context?"
