    "What reason is given for the lack of overfitting in the training curve for neural machine translation systems as described in the text?",
    "What characteristic is observed in the training curve for neural machine translation systems using transfer learning?",
    "The characteristic of the training curve for neural machine translation systems when using transfer learning is that it typically shows no overfitting, attributed to the model being well-regularized and having sufficient training data. As a result, performance remains stable, with the development set's performance increasing and then leveling off."
