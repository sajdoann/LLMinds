 So when we said, okay, simple sentences are probably just sort the corpus from the shortest to the longest sentences. And when we've trained the system using this sorted corpus, it's not alphabetically sorted, but it starts with, there is still some repetitions in the corpus, it starts with very similar sentences and boring sentences in a way. So when the network is trained on data which is not random, then it fails to learn in the final task. So training on a sorted corpus in whatever way you sort it is always a very bad idea. What you should always do is to randomize the data. And then the network will, each of the batches will illustrate well enough where the optimum of the parameters is and where the training should move in the next step. So we wanted to achieve this curriculum learning. We wanted to give the model first the easy sentences and then the hard sentences. But sorting it straight away doesn't work.
