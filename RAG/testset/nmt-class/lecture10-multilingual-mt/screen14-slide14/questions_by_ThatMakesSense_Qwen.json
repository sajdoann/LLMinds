    "What approach was used in early transfer learning experiments when dealing with language pairs?",
    "What was the idea behind \"trivial transfer\" in the context of the transfer learning task described?",
    "The setup in early transfer learning experiments involved using English as a common language and focusing on language pairs that were related. The approach used was \"trivial transfer,\" where the model was trained on a parent language pair and then directly applied to a child language pair without altering the model's parameters."
