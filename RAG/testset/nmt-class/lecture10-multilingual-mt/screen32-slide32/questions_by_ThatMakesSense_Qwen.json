    "What effect does training a parent model on sentences of different lengths have on the BLEU score and the length of the translated outputs?",
    "How does training the parent model on sentences of varying lengths affect its translation performance, as measured by BLEU score and output length?",
    "When the parent model was trained on sentences with 20 to 40 words, the BLEU score was significantly lower compared to training on a balanced range of sentence lengths. Additionally, the output sentences were longer than the average length of 15 words, leading to a decrease in BLEU score due to precision issues with n-grams and brevity penalties."
