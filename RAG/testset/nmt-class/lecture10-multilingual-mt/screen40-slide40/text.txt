 It was tested on many types of models, but it was difficult to reuse the knowledge from the languages because there were very strong independence assumptions in these models and we have discussed them in the previous lectures. So usually it was done by translating from the different source languages into the target and obtaining multiple target candidates. In neural machine translation, the very underlying principle is that the neural machine translation system is a conditioned language model. It is conditioned on the source sentence as a whole. And now we want to condition it on more source sentences. So it's not too complicated. The neural network style of translation lends itself much easier to...
