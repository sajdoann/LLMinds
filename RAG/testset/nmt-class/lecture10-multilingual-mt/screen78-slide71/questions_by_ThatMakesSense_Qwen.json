    "What effect does increasing the number of parameters have on the performance of the model, particularly on high-resource language pairs?",
    "What performance improvements are observed on high-resource language pairs when the model size is increased from 400 million parameters to 50 billion parameters, and what role do 'further tricks' play in this?",
    "What parameter size allows the model to avoid loss on high-resource languages according to the text?"
