 Then the spoken language translation, as I said, the input is the sound in one language and the output is sometimes text. Some people use this term to refer to speech-to-speech translation directly, but to make it clear, I'll talk always about speech-to-speech translation when there will be the target in voice already. And the benefits for the direct speech-to-speech translations is clear again. There is an option.ps青 올라se. We aim at direct modeling. So we would have a deep neural network model which process the time frames in the source language and produces time frames in the target language. Thereby it will handle all the differences and commonalities between the languages. We also have direct access to features that are outside of the of the verbal So we could preserve the voice, the tone, the prosthetics, all these bits. It would be rather difficult to ship this information, or a little bit more complicated, to ship this information along with a text-based translation to make the text choices in the target language good, and also then, when synthesizing the target voice, to reflect what was expressed in the...
