 So one of the issues was indeed that there was some internet connectivity problem at the ASR partner and the whole pipeline was then slow and we didn't know. So we have run the like a pre-test session on the evening before that day and everything worked smoothly and when we were doing the live subtitling suddenly there was a long delay and we didn't know what is happening and well there was some reconstruction happening in of that institute. So that was an unexpected delay. And this architecture is well complex and still we need to add proper diagnosis tools so that we would know if the whole output is the final output is delayed we need to know where the delay is coming from and it is pretty hard to diagnose like debug this multi-party system. especially if it's this way non-deterministic. So one day it works and another day it doesn't work because there are too many components involved and they are distributed in the space.
