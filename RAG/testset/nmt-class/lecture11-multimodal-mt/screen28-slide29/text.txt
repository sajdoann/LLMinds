 machine. We also had a strange misconfiguration issue and it took us quite a while to diagnose it. This is a complex setup and the error that we made was that we happened to start the ASR system locally. That was intentional because the models like we had we had the models compiled only on the on the particle machine which was directly acquired the sound. So that was that was on purpose but it was was to ship the sound twice first to the mediator and then serve as a worker in this pipeline. So this is a tiny typo in the configuration. The whole pipeline works but it is delayed because your first mile connection is overloaded with the sound that you are shipping there and back. So again this is something which is very easy to make as a mistake and quite difficult to realize. Let's talk about the sound acquisition now.
