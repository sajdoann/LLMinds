 Well, we made a very little comparison in one of the sessions. This is based just on three minutes, so this is something that we should really redo. But we have tried two types of mics. One was the chest mic and one was the headset microphone, the one which is just very close to your mouth. And there is a clear benefit of using the headset microphone because the distance from the mouth doesn't change.
