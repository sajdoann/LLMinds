 the realistic setups. So here is an example of all the challenges that an ASR system would face. Let's say that the speaker was a high school student. We had those in one of our test sessions because we were taking part in a festival or fair trade of student companies like mock business companies and they were presenting their company so let's imagine that one of the student was trying to say you have a bottle? Oh yes, we're situated in the heart of České Budějovice. So this is what he wanted to say and unfortunately his pronunciation because he was not native English speaker was wrong in the word bottle and also in the weir. So he would say you have a bottle? Oh yes, we are situated in heart instead of heart of České Budějovice. And there was additional So this is what was actually uttered and what appears in the recording then. And then if someone is present at that scene and he's listening to that, then he would probably understand you have a bottle. That would be unexpected. So only later on from the speech he would realize that this is a hotel on the river in a boat. And the listener would be able to recover from the mispronouncing and he would be able to recover from the river in a boat. So that he would know that some city name was mentioned but he would not be able to recognize it. The current best system that we had recognized just oh yes the off because the noise was so bad that they simply couldn't catch up, couldn't recognize any words. If the noise would be somehow cancelled or if the would be resilient to that, then it would have recognized something like, you have somebody too instead of the bottle. Oh yes, we are situated in a heart, which can we do? So the České Budějovice is not in the vocabulary of the ASR system and that would fail. And if the ideal output, the thing that we were all hoping for, and maybe a knowledgeable person would be able to understand, what the user wanted to say, you have a bottle and then České Budějovice. So there is a number of problems and all them play against us. All of them play against us.
