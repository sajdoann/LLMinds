 Here is an illustration how the bad speech recognition and some errors in machine translation totally depart from the original meaning of the sentence. So if we are using just speech recognition system, then the words that are recognized are related, they are very similar to the words that were actually uttered. What the system for speech recognition did, it produced the output and the goal of my thesis is to fold. Obviously, the goal of my thesis was twofold. So the two was recognized as a too short word. Maybe it was pronounced too shortly, I don't know. And the output by our English to check machine translation system from this input was something like, and the goal of my theses and theory. And this twofold was translated as is to fall apart. So instead of the goal of my thesis to be twofold, the goal of my theory was to fall apart. That obviously doesn't make any sense. And we see that recovering from this twofold is much easier than recovering from this to fall apart. The final of the machine translation output has no other information to consider. So for the machine translation of the spoken language, there is a very large context needed, many sentences around. And if someone would be like giving a speech to you and you were following that speech through this speech translation system, if the person was all the time saying, yes, we will close the deal, we will close the deal, we will do it. And then suddenly in the final sentence, he would say, let's forget it or you were an idiot and I don't want to work with you. That very likely this isolated sentence would be an error of the machine translation system or the combination of the systems. So you would obviously lose some of your confidence in that deal, but still the of sentences that you have received so far would be positive and approving. So when using these systems, the end user should rely on much larger context to get the full message correctly. Because errors are going to be much more severe than the errors in machine translation alone. or speech recognition alone.
