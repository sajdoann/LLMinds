 So here is an example of what can happen if you misplace the punctuation. So what the speaker said was some words and then all too well. And the speaker was saying something like this approach does not generalize all too well. So he used kind of filler words, this all too well. That is a phrase which ideally you would say in a simpler way. But in spontaneous speech people people often use filler words and these filler words were then uttered, they were correctly recognized. And the problem was that the segmenter decided to put a full stop after that all too. So what came out of that was this approach does not generalize all too. And that was shipped to translation. And then the next sentence was well so to somehow conclude that the whole talk. So here you see the disfluency. and also this well was simply misplaced in the output. And these errors are in some very severe because the machine translation system will take these sentences as trustworthy and it will use even the surrounding words which maybe should not have belonged to the sentence in the first place. But the empty system will use them and it will shuffle them and make, put them even into some in some prominent position in the sentence. So a random shift of the punctuation mark can terribly damage the final output.
