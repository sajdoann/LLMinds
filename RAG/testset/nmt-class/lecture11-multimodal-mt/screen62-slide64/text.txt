 So there is also the cognitive load considerations. If the users are following some slides and the subtitles because they cannot understand the spoken language, then these have to be very close to each other and they have to be like at the same distance from the audience because your eyes will need to accommodate if you would be looking at the slides on the wall and reading the subtitles on your screen. ahí KIBO PAROHDE rapamura SLVERE去 de la simple And I think, I'm pretty sure that the settings, the paragraph view or the subtitle view that you have seen on the slides, will serve better different types of users. So if the user understands the source language a little, then they can follow the source language and they can look at the subtitles in their mother tongue as kind of hinting or and in that case, they will definitely prefer simultaneity over the precision and stability of the output because they will be mainly following the sound and the subtitles can hint them maybe some words they would not understand, they will appear there correctly. But if the user does not speak the source language at all, then we can give up on simultaneity because there is nothing that needs to be delivered as quickly as possible. So the user who doesn't speak the source language at all will prefer stability and precision over the immediateness of the translation. And these users will be happy to wait for seconds of delay. So that's why the two different views can be better for different settings. So this is again to illustrate that the task is very complex and it has to be handled and considered end to end because different set of users will probably prefer different final outputs and these different final outputs then backwards will like indicate that some of the underlying components are better or worse for the task.
