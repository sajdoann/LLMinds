    "What issue did the teacher encounter in the example where the translation of \"Two lamps lying in the sun\" into Hindi was incorrect, and how did the image contribute to this challenge?",
    "What challenge is highlighted in the example involving the translation of \"Two lamps lying in the sun\" into Hindi using the Visual Genome dataset?",
    "The example given is where the English sentence \"Two lamps lying in the sun\" was mistranslated into Hindi as \"two baby sheep are telling lies.\" The image of two lamps lying in the sun didn't assist in correcting the translation because \"lying\" could mean both lying in the sun and lying to each other, which the picture didn't depict."
