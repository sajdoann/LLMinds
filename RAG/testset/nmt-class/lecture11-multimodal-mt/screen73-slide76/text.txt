 So here is an example of... So here is a reminder how the visual information can be used. So before I describe how the visual information can be used, let me remind you of the attention architecture that we discussed very early in the series of these lectures. You have the input sentence. You process it with bidirectional recurrent neural network and then you attend to these states that correspond to different words in the sentence. And then you are producing the output and this attention mechanism will always focus on another part of the input sentence as you proceed and produce the output. This attention mechanism was used in the past not only for input sentencing.
