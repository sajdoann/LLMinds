 This is a picture, an illustration from a paper of colleagues of mine, Inrich Ljubovitsky and Helsel. And they combined these two attentions, the attention over the source text and attention over the image in multiple ways. And the particular setup that was working best for them was called the hierarchical attention. So the hierarchical attention is illustrated here. a man schläft auf einem grünen Sofa in einem grünen Raum. And the input sentence was a man sleeping in a green room on a couch. And this is the hierarchical attention. So in the first line we see how often or to what extent was the decoder looking at the source words. The second line says to what extent was it considering the image. And it's all black. So it's very rarely considering the image. And the third step is how often it is considering itself in self-attention. So looking at its previous output words. And we are now focused on the image, on the visual information in this setup. And I said that the line two is all black. It's actually not fully black. There are lighter spots. When we are talking, when the a decoder is producing the word green. And so when the color is mentioned the color of the room is like very clearly green on the on the slides. So this green color was so salient and so so informative that the decoder took a little look at the visual information. So with this setup you can see how How often the visual information is actually used in the...
