 DW Learn German. Everyday German. The dark history of Berlin's Charité hospital. Many German universities and scientific institutions were involved in crimes committed by the National Socialists. It was not until later that they began to come to terms with their dark past. The famous Charité in Berlin was no exception. It was not only companies or the two major Christian churches in Germany that were either involved in Nazi crimes themselves or tacitly condoned them, but also German scientific institutions. For example, experiments were carried out in concentration camps, forced labourers were employed in university canteens and professors were dismissed because they were Jewish. After decades of trivialisation, some scientific institutions have begun to come to terms with their past. In 1997, the Max Planck Society was one of the first institutions to set up a working group to research its own past. The Berlin science historian Rüdiger vom Bruch, who has been researching the Nazi past of German universities for many years, believes that this initiative provided the impetus for others. I think that was a very decisive breakthrough. And then, on a broader front, other institutions and companies said that we wanted to face up to the past. Not necessarily out of a sense of personal guilt, but because public attacks had become so strong that people thought it would be better if we didn't commission a neutral or unbiased investigation by specialised historians ourselves. Although studies on universities were already being produced in the 1970s, these were due to the commitment of individual academics. Only since the end of the 1990s have German universities been prepared to face up to their National Socialist past and come to terms with it. According to Rüdiger vom Bruch, the Max Planck Society brought about the breakthrough and ensured that many others followed suit. It happened on a broad front. But the main reason was not that people felt guilty. It did not happen out of a sense of guilt. Rather, they only acted because of public criticism. And to avoid being seen as biased, as not objective enough, specialised historians were commissioned who were neutral. But why did the reappraisal begin so late? Rüdiger vom Bruch has an explanation. Because some revered teachers were affected and people didn't dare to ask questions. One point that we see time and again in all kinds of subjects is that the so-called or supposed shining lights of the subject seem to have had nothing to do with Nazi ideology and crimes and were far more affected than you might think. For a long time, scientists were convinced that they had not been involved in Nazi ideology. However, many scientists sympathised with the Nazis early on and put their work at the service of the regime. Racial research, human experimentation and forced sterilisation also took place at the Charité, one of the oldest and most famous university hospitals in Germany. Hardly any of the non-Jewish doctors dared to talk about it, ask questions or publicly oppose National Socialism. This was because it often concerned so-called shining lights, i.e. people who were really highly recognised or who appeared to be. Even famous scientists such as the surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch or the psychiatrist Karl Bonhoeffer supported political plans of the National Socialists such as forced sterilisations or human experiments in concentration camps. Both were employed at the Charité. She is also coming to terms with her past. With the project Gedenkort Charité - Wissenschaft in Verantwortung. The project, which was launched in 2013, commemorates its Jewish employees. These people and their work are presented on memorial pillars. The head of the Charité, Prof Dr Karl-Max Einhäupel, explains the aims of the project. Actually, the original idea was that we as Charité had to create something that was represented by renowned artists in a very visible form. We also want to combine the whole thing with a museum section, in which an educational trail is also created for young students and young doctors, who should also take this as an opportunity to reflect on how a doctor actually comes to be involved and implicated in such offences. Something special was to be created in memory of the employees. They wanted to create something, bring something to life that was created by well-known, renowned artists. And so the memorial columns were created. The project is also to include a museum and an educational trail, a path along which individual historical stations are described. According to Prof Karl-Max Einhäupel, the aim is for the doctors of today and tomorrow to ask themselves the question: "How did the National Socialists manage to win over doctors, for example, to envelop them? The project is being supervised by Udo Schagen, historian in the Department of Medical History at Charité. For the memorial columns, he has compiled the names of Charité employees who were isolated and dismissed after 1933 and many of whom had to leave Germany. However, as Udo Schagen says, the research is far from complete. We now know of well over 180 Jewish lecturers and professors. Only very few of them are assistants. And we also don't know how many Jews were dismissed from the nursing professions. There were certainly more than twice as many, because traditionally the number of Jewish employees in the medical and nursing professions was very high. Medical historians have been able to trace the fate of more than 180 high-ranking Jewish doctors. However, little is known about the fate of Jewish assistant doctors, nurses and carers. Many lecturers and professors managed to flee abroad because they usually had enough money and personal contacts. However, starting a new career in their new home country was not easy for various reasons, says Udo Schagen. Very often they ended up in countries where they were not allowed to practise their medical profession, sometimes had to study again, sometimes lived in dependence on other people. The doctors were either not allowed to work at all or they lived in dependence on others, relying on them to get them a job, for example. Some even had to study again despite having a degree. For Charité director Karl Max Einhäupel, the fact that students today deal with the behaviour of doctors during the Third Reich is an important part of training in medical ethics. We are convinced that such offences often begin with a small shift in ethical norms. And such small shifts in ethical standards may also take place in many areas of medicine. And we must realise at an early stage that this can be the first step towards a development that may even take on historical dimensions, as was the case in the Third Reich. The Charité memorial project should not only remind us of the past, but also serve as a reminder to a new generation of doctors. And perhaps also to other professional groups. Because, as Professor Karl Max Einhäupel says, certain behaviour often begins with a small shift in ethical norms. Behaviour that would normally be considered wrong is suddenly seen as normal. And several small shifts can then even develop into something bigger, taking on historical dimensions, which, as under National Socialism, among other things, led to the murder of millions of people. www.dw.deutschlernen Alltagsdeutsch Learn more at www.dw.com slash deutschlernen
