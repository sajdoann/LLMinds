 Thank you very much, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Following on from Mrs Scharke, I would like to say two or three sentences about the important report she has produced. The cultural dimension of the EU's external policy cannot be given enough importance. As you have already said, we therefore need a coherent EU strategy for culture in EU foreign policy. Cultural diplomacy plays an important role in building successful relations with third countries. And in many countries we can fall back on a network of cultural institutes, the EU-NIC. There are a great many of them that have joined forces. We will be there to help. I would now like to turn to a second topic from today, the topic that has already been addressed by Mr Zwer, the topic of Youth on the Move. This is a flagship initiative of the 2020 strategy. This flagship initiative is intended to encourage all players in the field of education and training to focus more attention on these policy areas. We need better educated people. We need people who have experienced Europe through improved mobility programmes. We need to unlock the potential of young people through our successful programmes. All of this plays a major role in the competitiveness of a knowledge-based society. With the existing Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo and Grundwig programmes in the field of lifelong learning, we have given many people wonderful opportunities to discover Europe in all its diversity, to gain knowledge for themselves and to improve their language skills. Furthermore, the importance of the Youth in Action programme and the European Voluntary Service programme should not be underestimated in this context. Today's debate must also send a signal to the Commission that we must continue these programmes and opportunities, which people have embraced, in the next generation of education and youth programmes and that their funding must be commensurate with their importance. Every euro we spend in this area will pay off for society as a whole in just a few years' time. I now come to the other topic of Sarajevo. Sarajevo has a special place in European history and culture. By designating Sarajevo as European Capital of Culture 2014, we could send an important signal in favour of the multi-ethnic character of the city and the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which could perhaps also prompt the country's political class to rethink its position. In addition, this city makes it abundantly clear how much Europe has failed and how important it is to act together. This would be a significant sign that Sarajevo was the scene of the assassination that triggered the First World War in 1914. Hence 2014, 100 years later. During the Bosnian War, from 1992 to 1996, Sarajevo suffered the longest siege of a capital city in the history of modern warfare. Let me remind you of one day, 28 May 1992 in Sarajevo. The cellist Vedrans Maljovic, dressed in black, was playing the Adagio by Tomasino Albino on his instrument. His stage is the ruins of the destroyed National Library in Sarajevo. His audience was a small group of people who stayed to listen to his music despite the siege of the city. And they came again. For 22 days, he played in various squares in the destroyed city of Sarajevo. It was his requiem for the people who were killed during those days. I was moved and I admired the courageous and encouraging behaviour of the cellist and his listeners. And that, and yet the behaviour of the people in the face of horror and loss, has forever connected me to this city. Sarajevo's cultural life has never stopped. The Winter Festival took place under the most adverse circumstances. And people of all nationalities gather there every year. Every year there is a winter festival, a kids' festival, a film festival. Filmmakers from Korea to Australia, from Bulgaria to Sweden come to Sarajevo. Co-productions are made. The city has an intercultural character that it preserves and cultivates. Regardless of how the political environment is becoming increasingly divided along ethnic lines. For this alone, this city deserves the chance to demonstrate its immense intercultural potential. Sarajevo wants to apply for the title as part of an exceptional regulation and has already undertaken extensive preparations for this. We all know very well that if we vote in favour of our proposal today, we will be asking for a derogation from the decision of the European Parliament and the Council. However, if this House expresses its support for Sarajevo's application today, then I trust in the Council's insight and foresight, because our arguments cannot really be countered. Bosnia-Herzegovina and Sarajevo need a sign right now that all is not lost, that Europe also supports these endeavours. Thank you.
