    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Vít Rakušan is talking here about the statement of the chairman of the KSČM, Vojtěch Filip, who, in <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/vojteh-filip-bolshinstvo-grazhdan-cheshskoj-respubliki-vot-uzhe-75-let-ispytyvayut-chuvstvo-blagodarnosti-k-krasnoj-armii-2/\">an interview</a> published on May 15, 2020 by the Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, stated:</p><p> <i>“(…) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [is] departing from the national position when it criticizes the Russian Federation for not yet restoring war memorials on its territory to the fallen Czechoslovak legionnaires who fought in Samara, near Lipiag near Novokuybyshev and in other places in Russia with Russian revolutionary communists in 1918.</i></p><p> <i>Members of the KSČM and other citizens of the Czech Republic positively perceive the fact that the Russian government does not show interest in forcing local authorities to build monuments to those Czech legionnaires who did not liberate anyone in Russia and did nothing good for the most brilliant world socialist revolution of the last century in 1917 in Russia.”</i></p><p> The mentioned legionnaires who fought in <a href=\"http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:b5c8164d-afea-4a70-b22a-624680b5fdef?page=uuid:88aa7912-10f7-11e8-b8ac-005056b73ae5\">Samara</a> on the Volga in June 1918 (PLESKÝ, Metoděj. <i>4th Regiment of Prokop the Great</i> . 1936, p. 219) and at the Lipjagi station in the nearby city of Novokuybyshevsk (ibid., pp. 202–203) are soldiers of the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý and <a href=\"http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:dde50707-6b59-4eef-a3d6-916586657465?page=uuid:cefb781e-0fc9-11e8-ad37-005056b73ae5&amp;fulltext=samara\">the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi</a> (LANGER, František. <i>Memorial Book of the 1st Rifle Regiment of Jan Husi.</i> 1920, p. 44). They defeated the Bolshevik troops here, with whom they came into conflict mainly because the Russian side did not comply with the agreement on the departure of the Czechoslovak legionnaires via Vladivostok to France. Tomáš Jakl, a historian at the Military Historical Institute, <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/co-se-odehravalo-behem-velke-valky-na-vychodni-fronte/\">states</a> :</p><p> <i>&quot;However, at the end of April 1918, the transportation of Czechoslovak transports practically stopped due to pressure from Germany. In addition, at the end of May, the Soviet government attempted to completely disarm the Czechoslovak corps and transfer the Czechoslovaks either to the Red Army or to labor units. The Czechoslovak soldiers responded to this attempt by deciding to leave for Vladivostok on their own.&quot;</i></p><p> Before the beginning of the conflicts with the Bolsheviks, these Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia had already achieved a number of military successes in battles with the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. In March 1918, for example, the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý took part in the Battle of <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/exhibit/ruske-legie-v-bitve-u-bachmace-1918/\">Bachmač</a> , where an important railway junction was located. And above all, the soldiers of the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi fought victoriously at <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/zborov-bitva-ktera-cs-vojakum-vydobyla-respekt/\">Zborov</a> in early July 1917.</p><p> Currently, both cities are located in Ukraine, and at the time of the fighting, Bachmač was part of the independent <a href=\"http://www.haidamaka.org.ua/obr/sxslob/mapaunr.jpg\">Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic</a> and Zborov was part of <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Europe_1918.jpg\">the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</a> However, it is important to mention that, for example, Bachmač was still part of <a href=\"https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/map-russian-empire-1914\">the Russian Empire</a> at the beginning of World War I. Let us add that at Zborov, the entire Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade was directly subordinated to the Russian <a href=\"https://kramerius.army.cz/search/i.jsp?pid=uuid:0fee9338-6380-4fab-8551-ecef91c582d5&amp;q=&amp;fq=document_type:%22monograph%22&amp;fq=keywords:%221.%20%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A1%20d%C4%9Blost%C5%99eleck%C3%A1%20brig%C3%A1da%22#monograph-page_uuid:51ea50b3-0fc3-11e8-927a-005056b73ae5\">49th Army Corps</a> (KAVENA, Karel. <i>History of the 1st Artillery Regiment of Jan Žižka of Trocnov in the Russian Revolution and in the Fatherland</i> . 1937, p. 44). It is also an indisputable fact that the 4th and 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiments, with their work (along with many others), helped Russia to achieve final victory on the Eastern European battlefield.</p><p> According to historians, the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian army near the town of Zborov also <a href=\"https://books.google.cz/books?id=li-2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=v%C3%BDznam+zborova+samostatn%C3%A9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkOxi0hmPp&amp;sig=ACfU3U2orK3G_vX83GzgA2tpeU7ffHK1ew&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiv3P358sfpAhXJ8OAKHZvtAqQQ6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A9%20st%C3%A1tn%C3%AD%20samostatnosti&amp;f=false\">played</a> (MOJŽÍŠ, Milan, RAK, Michal et al. <i>Zborov 1917–2017</i> . 2019, p. 150) along with other combat actions of Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia a very <a href=\"http://www.acr.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=11914\">important role</a> in political negotiations on the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak Republic. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Zborov in 2017, for example, the Chamber of Deputies adopted <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=10179\">a resolution</a> that ends with the words: <i>&quot;The deeds of the legionnaires should never be forgotten. The heroes of Zborov have contributed to the state.&quot;</i></p><p> For these reasons, Vojtěch Filip&#39;s statement can to some extent be considered as questioning the historical role of these units, as Vít Rakušan states in the statement. However, it is clear from the statement that Vojtěch Filip directly questioned the role of the legionnaires in the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia. Filip spoke only about their importance for Russia and the revolution in Russia. Rakušan thus presents Filip&#39;s statement in a misleading context.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>The chairman of the KSČM gave <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/vojteh-filip-bolshinstvo-grazhdan-cheshskoj-respubliki-vot-uzhe-75-let-ispytyvayut-chuvstvo-blagodarnosti-k-krasnoj-armii-2/\">an interview</a> to the Russian newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, which was published on May 15, 2020 with the headline &quot; <i>Vojtěch Filip: Most citizens of the Czech Republic have felt gratitude to the Red Army for 75 years</i> .&quot; In addition to the questions themselves, in which the editorial office does not mention Vojtěch Filip&#39;s position, the article also contains a short introduction, in the exact wording:</p><p> <i>&quot;The first deputy chairman of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, Vojtěch Filip, answered the questions of the Rudá hvězda newspaper.&quot;</i> (In the original: <i>&quot;На вопросы газети «Красная звезда» перевод первый местетиль предложение палаты палаты паляты палаты парламента Чешской Республики Vojtekh Filip.&quot;</i> )</p><p> For the sake of completeness, we would like to point out that throughout the entire interview it is not explicitly stated that Vojtěch Filip is also the chairman of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia. This is only apparent from his answers, which contain expressions such as &quot; <i>generally speaking, I can note for the KSČM...&quot;</i> etc.</p><p> The newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/o-gazete/\">has been published</a> since 2018 with the subtitle Newspaper of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and was previously also the central press organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense. It is therefore possible to describe it as a military newspaper, as Vít Rakušan states. His description of this periodical as a magazine is somewhat more problematic, as the aforementioned subtitle already suggests, Krasnaya Zvezda describes itself as a newspaper. Despite this minor discrepancy, however, we generally assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>&quot; <i>I am ready to support a resolution that clearly states that the Chamber of Deputies values the role of the legionnaires in the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic,&quot;</i> Jan Hamáček said on May 17 in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions ( <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/220411030500517/\">video</a> , time 17:28). Further in the discussion, Jan Hamáček emphasized that it is necessary to clearly state what the role of our legionnaires was in the past.</p><p> This statement corresponds to part of the draft resolution of the Chamber of Deputies, which was presented on May 18 by the chairman of the STAN movement, Vít Rakušan. The last point of this proposal <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/info-a-media/tiskove-zpravy/rakusan-snemovna-by-mela-odvolat-soudruha-filipa-z-vedeni-a-distancovat-se-od-jeho-slov\">states</a> that the Chamber of Deputies &quot; <i>respects the struggle of the Czechoslovak legionnaires during the First World War, who with their courage and determination fundamentally contributed to the establishment of an independent, free and democratic Czechoslovakia</i> .&quot;</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: If you look at the vote of the security committee that evaluated the information from the Security Information Service, even the parties that usually don&#39;t applaud the BIS, whether it&#39;s the SPD or the Communists, they all voted for the resolution where we defined the threat as serious. \nSECTION B: After all, in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions, Jan Hamáček also expressed that at least that part of the resolution that I proposed and where we say that the legionnaires as such are simply those who have contributed to our state, and that should not be questioned and the Chamber of Deputies supports that, so he is ready to support that part of the resolution.\nSECTION C: (...) but to question within the Russian Federation, within their media space, the role of our legionnaires in history – those who simply stood as one of the first for the freedom of Czechoslovakia, for the fact that we had the first democratic state, the so often invoked first republic – and he dares to question it (Vojtěch Filip, note: Demagog.cz).\nSECTION D: (...) the preparatory steps, even according to the recommendations of this team (Pavel Řehák, note: Demagog.cz), were supposed to be carried out in those summer months. And they were not. In those summer months, the Central Epidemiological Commission did not even meet, which, by the way, is exactly recommended here, how it should work, how to prepare pandemic plans.\nSECTION E: That was in the draft resolution - that point was not discussed for technical reasons, it was postponed to the next meeting of the security committee - but the resolution asked whether there was any methodology and whether there should not be, and whether there should not be a binding methodology for all members of the government, specifically for the use, the secure use of email accounts, the government&#39;s own.\nSECTION F: I am originally a history teacher and I perceive the role of the Vlasovites as very contradictory. I realize that at the end of the war they certainly helped Prague, for example, but overall we cannot see their role as entirely positive, although history always has many interpretations. They are people who opposed Stalin, but at the same time they are people who fought on the side of the Germans.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
