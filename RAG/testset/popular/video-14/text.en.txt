 Good afternoon, here's my next speech, which again is likely to be quite demanding and will last around seven minutes. The topic is, in the broadest sense, the car and everything that has to do with it, parking, repairs and so on, including refuelling, and I'm going to report on a technology project that is currently underway at Google. They are trying to develop self-driving or so-called autonomous cars, which should make driving easier for us in the future or take it off our hands completely. That's the introduction so far and now I'll get started. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy driving at all. I don't like sitting in a car and that's why I don't own one. When I came here to Brussels from Germany a few years ago, in 2007, for work, I decided with my wife that we should simply sell our car. Because there were a whole series of problems with it. For one thing, we had no parking space in front of our flat, no garage, no reliable way of parking the car. And I didn't want to spend another 20 minutes looking for a parking space every day after work. I also had the impression that driving in Brussels wouldn't be much fun. On top of that, car repairs are often very expensive, you have to go to the MOT regularly to have your car checked and the car itself is not particularly environmentally friendly as a means of transport. And if you think about it, most of the time a car just sits around unused. In the garage, in the car park, outside work, wherever. The effective journey time is relatively short. But let's try to imagine that everything would be completely different. That driving a car would be a completely different experience than it is today. An experience without parking problems, where the car parks itself. An experience where we could read the newspaper or eat in the car or have a lively conversation with other passengers. Imagine if there were far fewer accidents, especially fatal accidents, than is the case today. Well, what would you say if I told you that it is possible? It's not a dream. Because there is a big American company, and you know it, that is already working on realising this dream. I'm talking about Google. You are probably familiar with Google. Google is the largest search engine in the world, where you can literally find anything you are looking for. Of course, Google is also active in other areas and places a lot of adverts. It is therefore an important advertising provider. Google also has its own operating system for mobile phones, so-called smartphones, and for tablet computers, which are also becoming increasingly popular. And you have probably already used the map service, Google Maps, at one time or another to find your way somewhere. Google also has its own secret research laboratory. It's called Google X. And in this research lab, many Google technicians are working on putting crazy ideas into practice. Some of them may not work out, but others are already very advanced. For example, this self-driving or autonomous car project. Now you might be thinking, how is that supposed to work? Well, because Google is involved, we know that it has a lot to do with technology. A computer system is built on top of a car. And this system consists of a video camera, a radar and a laser system, among other things. And this complex computer system continuously scans the vehicle's entire surroundings. So it looks to see where other vehicles are? Where are people crossing the footpath? Which signs, which traffic lights does the car need to pay attention to? And many other sources of information. All of this is continuously recorded and processed by this computer system so that the car can reliably find its way through the traffic. This project was launched by Google back in 2010, and since then the various vehicles in this fleet have already completed 300,000 test miles, according to the company. As an interesting aside, there is a short promotional film by Google in which a blind man, who only has five per cent vision, is travelling in this car. You can imagine what a great experience it must have been for him when he was able to drive this car for the first time, for example to pick up his dry cleaning or order something to eat at the drive-in counter. There are also three American states, namely Nevada, California and Florida, that have already issued the first regulations for these vehicles so that they can be tested on the roads. I'll come back to that in a moment. And according to some forecasts, there could be a lot of these autonomous vehicles on our roads as early as 2020. I would imagine that Google would be very happy about this because, as a technology company, it has a vested interest in selling autonomous car technology to the big car companies. But it's not quite there yet. At the moment, there are still quite strict regulations for the operation of these autonomous vehicles. For example, there must always be two people with a driving licence in the car. One of them needs a special driving licence to operate these autonomous cars. You need additional insurance. You can imagine why. And there are also only very specific routes in these states where these cars are allowed to drive. The decisive factor is that, at the end of the day, the human driver must always retain full control of the vehicle. But I don't know if that's necessarily such a good idea. Even today, we already have many technologies in our cars that are designed to support people. After all, humans are not perfect. For example, there are technologies that ensure that the vehicle always stays in the right lane or does not drive too close to the vehicle in front. The car may even brake itself. So we have already taken a few steps on the way to autonomous cars. I think the engineers would prefer the cars to drive themselves anyway. And the statistics prove them right. According to figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO), 1.2 million people die on the world's roads every year. The accident statistics for Google's autonomous cars have been excellent so far. No accidents. I think that makes all this effort worthwhile. And if these autonomous cars now also park themselves, refuel themselves and drive themselves to the MOT, then I'll think again about the car. To close Toils.
