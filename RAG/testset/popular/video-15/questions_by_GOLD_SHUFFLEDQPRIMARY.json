    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The statement by the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová, relates to the amendment to the Public Procurement Act <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABPJ9RLH6\">approved</a> by the government.</p><p> The Minister states that the main reason for submitting the amendment is the effort to speed up procedures and eliminate administrative burdens, which, according to her, is to be adjusted by changing the so-called negotiation procedure without publication. At the request of the government, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies decided that this <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=862\">proposal</a> will be discussed in a state of legislative emergency, which significantly limits the legislative process. The amendment is currently on the agenda of the meeting from May 26, 2020.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173714\">The explanatory memorandum</a> (.pdf, p. 3) of the amendment to the law states:</p><p> &quot; <i>The proposed amendment removes administrative obstacles to the award of contracts in negotiated procedures without publication so that negotiated procedures without publication based on Section 63, paragraphs 3 and 5 can be implemented in the shortest possible time.</i> &quot;</p><p> And he further comments on the need for adjustments due to the situation caused by the COVID-19 epidemic:</p><p> <i>&quot;It is necessary to ensure that the negotiated procedure, which is awarded in extremely urgent circumstances, is as administratively demanding as possible. Given the need to conclude the contract as quickly as possible, <strong>it is not appropriate to insist on actions to ensure the qualification of the supplier</strong> , convene an evaluation committee, or prevent the conclusion of the contract, as the public interest in the rapid performance of the public contract prevails here.&quot;</i></p><p> The key amendment is in Section 67, which regulates the procedure (ibid., p. 1). The following paragraph is added to the current wording:</p><p> <i><strong>&quot;(3) In the case of negotiated proceedings without publication pursuant to Section 63(3) and (5), Section 48(7) and (9), Section 73, Section 86 and Section 122 shall not apply.&quot;</strong></i></p><p> This point deserves further explanation, as it contains the changes that are to be made. According to paragraphs 3 and 5 <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p63\">of Section 63</a> , the following applies:</p><ul><li> <i>“The contracting authority may also use a negotiated procedure without publication if the public contract can only be performed by a particular supplier (…)”</i></li><li> <i>“The contracting authority may also use the negotiated procedure without publication if this is necessary as a result of extremely urgent circumstances which the contracting authority could not have foreseen and which it did not cause (…)”</i></li></ul><p> The proposed amendment to the law is therefore intended to allow certain requirements of the law not to be applied in cases of a negotiated procedure without publication, if there is not a large number of suppliers on the market or if there are urgent circumstances for this procedure. The key issue, however, is which requirements of the law will not have to be complied with in these cases.</p><p> As a result of the new Section 67, paragraph 3, access to contracts in the negotiated procedure without publication is simplified, for example, for companies that do not have book-entry shares (they do not have to have a clear ownership structure), which is regulated in the current version by <a href=\"\thttps://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p48-7\">Section 48, paragraphs 7</a> and <a href=\"\thttps://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p48-9\">9.</a> Companies do not have to submit documents on qualification pursuant to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p86\">Section 86</a> , and in the case of legal entities, the contracting authority does not have to ascertain information about its beneficial owner pursuant to <a href=\"\thttps://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p122-4\">Section 122, paragraph 4.</a> At the same time, one of the basic criteria for selecting a supplier pursuant to this Act is abolished - namely, the one that provides the most economically advantageous tender pursuant to <a href=\"\thttps://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p122-1\">Section 122, paragraph 1</a> .</p><p> It is therefore clear that these changes will significantly simplify the process of awarding public contracts through negotiated procedures without publication. However, Transparency International Czech Republic <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/vlada-ve-stavu-nouze-navrhuje-novelu-zakona-o-zadavani-verejnych-zakazek-ktera-otevira-dvere-miliardovym-skodam-a-ohrozuje-bezpecnost-cr/\">lists</a> a number of consequences that the adoption of the amendment may have. These include, for example, suspicious purchases and potential financial damage to the state caused by providing freedom in the negotiated procedure without publication. The Ministry of Regional Development, in turn, <a href=\"https://mmr.cz/cs/ostatni/web/novinky/mmr-novela-zakona-o-verejnych-zakazkach-zajisti-r\">argues for</a> the need to simplify the administratively overly complex procedure.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because the justification of the amendment to the Public Procurement Act and its content clearly show the goal of simplifying and accelerating the award of public contracts in cases falling under tender procedures without publication. However, this fact does not call into question the criticism directed at the discussed amendment. The amendment to the Act may be perceived as potentially dangerous.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>The Ministry of the Interior also commented on the draft Building Act in its <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNBK2CPYTM\">analysis</a> (.pdf). In her statement, Minister Dostálová criticizes the estimates of the Ministry of the Interior, which estimated one-time costs at CZK 2.2—31.6 billion (p. 4). The part of securing space for new regional building offices and the <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/pripominky-k-stavebnimu-zakonu-muze-mmr-resit-do-konce-brezna/1838883\">planned</a> Supreme Building Office is mainly criticized.</p><p> The Ministry of the Interior states in the introduction to the section <em>on Premises</em> (p. 32) that the draft law “(...) <em>currently assumes an optimistic scenario where municipalities and regions will provide the state with their current premises. This expectation is unrealistic; the capacity of municipalities and regions will not be made available, as it would bring extraordinary problems in the area of IT, operation, sharing of services (e.g. the registry office) or working in a different regime (the Act on Civil Servants vs. the Civil Service Act). In the event of delimitation, it will be necessary to provide premises.</em> ”<em> </em>Estimates for securing premises by renting are around CZK 425 million per year. The Ministry further notes that “ <em>(...) it is not possible to solve the delimitation by renting everywhere, as no suitable premises are available at all in certain locations.</em> ”<em> </em>(p. 33)</p><p> The chapter dedicated to Construction (pp. 33—34) then states that &quot; <em>The maximalist variant assumes that new premises would be built for all existing officials of building authorities, integrated affected bodies and new service personnel. This includes 13,584 employees in total. Construction expenses would reach at least 25.4 billion crowns in the maximalist variant.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(p. 34). To these costs it would be necessary to add the costs of building archives for storing documentation. These costs are around CZK 3.5 billion. In total, the Ministry of the Interior estimates the construction in the most expensive possible version at CZK 28.9 billion.<br/><br/> Minister Dostálová falsely stated that &quot; <em>(...) the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior does not state that the state currently pays municipalities for the officials who handle construction procedures&quot;</em> . The chapter Financing the Agenda in the analysis deals with this entire issue.<em> </em>(p. 36), which details the current financing of the agenda of building authorities, spatial planning and partly also the affected authorities, which are currently financed through a contribution to the performance of state administration (pursuant to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-128#p62-1\">Section 62 of Act No. 128/2000 Coll., on municipalities</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-129#p29-2\">Section 29(2) of Act No. 129/2000 Coll., on regions</a> ).</p><p> The procedures for determining the amount of the contribution for the performance of state administration for 2020 are listed in <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-355#f6688621\">the annex to</a> Act No. 355/2019 on the State Budget of the Czech Republic for 2020. The individual contribution amounts for specific municipalities can also be clearly found on <a href=\"https://www.prispevekobce.cz/\">the website</a> of the Ministry of the Interior.</p><p> The Ministry of the Interior further <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNBK2CPYTM\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 38) that the total real costs (including overheads) for the agenda of building authorities and land planning authorities at the municipal and regional levels amount to almost 4.6 billion CZK, of which 4.2 billion CZK are spent on municipalities. However, in reality, only 2.3 billion CZK is spent on the state budget through contributions to municipalities and regions. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the real overhead costs amount to 1.1 billion CZK.</p><p> Although the probability of constructing new buildings for all planned employees of new building authorities is unknown, we assess the statement as false, because the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior also addresses the issue of financing building authorities through contributions for the performance of state administration, the amount of which differs from those mentioned in Minister Dostálová&#39;s statement.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>The entire <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-prvni-audit-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_2104232054_tzr\">process</a> investigating Andrej Babiš&#39;s potential conflict of interest has been ongoing since 2018, when Transparency International <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-podava-prvni-podnet-tykajici-se-stretu-zajmu-andreje-babise/\">pointed out</a> the potential conflict of interest and also filed <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-podava-druhy-podnet-tykajici-se-stretu-zajmu-andreje-babise-a-evropskych-dotaci-pro-agrofert/\">a complaint</a> with the European Commission. The first preliminary audit report arrived in the Czech Republic in <a href=\"https://euractiv.cz/section/cr-v-evropske-unii/news/cesky-cerven-v-eu-traskave-audity-evropske-komise/\">June</a> 2019.</p><p> The audit investigation that preceded the report also <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropske-dotace-babis-agrofert-stret-zajmu-audit-kontroly-eu_1901111806_jgr\">affected</a> , among other things, the Ministry for Regional Development (MMR), or rather the National Coordination Body (NOK), whose <a href=\"https://kormoran.vlada.cz/usneseni/usneseni_webtest.nsf/web_file/uv130612.0448.doc/$File/uv130612.0448.doc\">role</a> (.doc, p. 1) <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/fondy-eu/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci\">is performed</a> by the MMR. At that time, officials were already in charge of the Czech side&#39;s response, so the minister should not have had any influence on it, at least not directly. However, she herself <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/ministerstvo-pro-mistni-rozvoj-audit-evropska-komise-stret-zajmu-premier-andrej-babis.A190827_142058_domaci_rko\">stated</a> : <i>&quot;Now we contradict every sentence on every page. We feel very hurt because a lot of things are not true.&quot;</i> We were unable to find in publicly available sources that Minister Dostálová met with EU auditors during the audit or at any time later, or that she was in direct contact with them regarding the report on Andrej Babiš&#39;s conflict of interest.</p><p> In the case of the response to the second audit report, which was delivered to the Czech Republic in <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-prvni-audit-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_2104232054_tzr\">December 2019</a> and was supposed to contain the final conclusions of the review and also mentioned a conflict of interest, it took longer to write the response. Minister Dostálová herself <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ministerstvo-poslalo-do-bruselu-odpoved-na-audit-k-babisove-stretu-zajmu-40325921\">stated</a> at the time that responses to audit reports are processed by officials. More precisely, she named officials of the National Coordination Body and also their <i>&quot;colleagues from the affected departments&quot;</i> . <i>&nbsp;</i> As we can learn from information on <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-stret-zajmu-praha-audit-evropska-komise-agrofert-dotace_1912051210_kno\">the iROZHLAS</a> server, this was mainly the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, whose competences include drawing subsidies from the aforementioned structural funds and the Cohesion Fund.</p><p> The Minister for Regional Development, especially shortly after the arrival of this second audit report, <a href=\"https://livestream.com/accounts/17590784/events/8915480/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=false&amp;defaultDrawer=&amp;autoPlay=false&amp;mute=false\">emphasized</a> (video, 0:48) that the documents are so-called <i>confidential</i> , i.e. in a confidential regime, and that <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/dostalova-komentuje-vysledky-auditu-k-babisovu-stretu-zajmu-40305726\">not</a> even ministers have access to them and that it is purely a matter for officials. She allegedly <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/dostalova-komentuje-vysledky-auditu-k-babisovu-stretu-zajmu-40305726\">did not read</a> the report herself and <i>is not &quot;interested&quot;</i> in it. However, she had also previously <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/klara-dostalova-evropska-komise-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_1912031101_miz\">added</a> : <i>&quot;We will definitely want to talk about some things face to face.&quot;</i></p><p> The only document currently published is the final audit <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cz_functioning_report/cz_functioning_report_en.pdf\">report</a> (.pdf) of the European Commission. For example, the report states that other entities audited (.pdf, pp. 1–2) are the Ministries of the Environment, Industry and Trade, and Labour and Social Affairs. In addition to the aforementioned ministries, agencies and funds were also <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/20770\">audited</a> , such as the Agency for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic, the Agency for the Promotion and Entrepreneurship and Investment CzechInvest, the ESI Funds Council, the Common Strategic Framework Funds Council, the National Coordination Body, the Steering and Control Committee, and the City of Prague.</p><p> In response to this final report, the Minister <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/dostalova-andrej-babis-agrofert-audit-soud-eu-evropska-komise_2104262032_ban\">stated</a> that the Czech authorities <i>“hold the legal opinion, based on the arguments sent to the European Commission, that there was no breach of regulations”</i> . She also insisted on the existence of two legal interpretations, between which only a court can decide. The Ministry for Regional Development <a href=\"https://mmr.cz/cs/ostatni/web/novinky/vyjadreni-mmr-k-auditu-evropske-komise\">states</a> in its press release that the Czech authorities in their responses to the European Commission <i>“have repeatedly stated that the management and control systems have been set up in the Czech Republic in accordance with EU and national rules governing the issue of conflict of interest and that the Czech Republic maintains this position”</i> .</p><p> In conclusion, let us summarize that we were unable to find in publicly available sources whether Klára Dostálová interfered with the officials of the National Coordination Body in formulating their responses to the European Commission, or to what extent this was done. For this reason, we assess the statement as unverifiable.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Minister Dostálová is talking about <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173718\">the government bill</a> (.pdf) amending Act <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134/zneni-20191126\">No. 134/2016 Coll.</a> , on public procurement. This bill has been submitted to the Chamber of Deputies as Chamber of Deputies Paper <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=862\">No. 862.</a> By Government <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABPJ9RLH6\">Resolution No. 534</a> (.pdf) of Monday, May 11 (4 days before the interview), the Government requested that this bill be discussed in a shortened session, and the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Radek Vondráček, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173719&amp;pdf=1\">granted</a> the request (.pdf).</p><p> According to <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/docs/laws/1995/90.html#99\">Section 99</a> of the Act on the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies, an abbreviated session in a state of legislative emergency means omitting the first reading of the bill, the possibility of omitting the general debate, and the possibility of limiting the time of individual deputies at the rostrum in the plenary session. It also gives the Speaker of the Chamber the opportunity to order the Guarantee Committee a deadline by which the committee must submit a resolution on the given proposal.</p><p> This resolution was issued by the guarantee committee, i.e. the committee for public administration and regional development, at meeting <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173728&amp;pdf=1\">No. 39</a> (.pdf, invitation) on May 13, 2020 at 10:00. Here, it issued resolution <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173897&amp;pdf=1\">No. 203</a> (.pdf) on the proposal, in which it proposes to the Chamber of Deputies to hold a general debate, conduct a detailed debate on all parts of the proposal and conclude the discussion on the proposal by 24:00 on the same day, i.e. Wednesday, May 13, 2020. At the same time, it recommends that the PS approve the proposal.</p><p> Before the start of the Chamber of Deputies&#39; session on May 13 (which <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/048schuz/s048001.htm\">began</a> at 3:00 p.m.), press conferences were held by the parliamentary groups. From <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=1509\">the regular order</a> of speeches by the individual parties in the press atrium and the recording <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/p...220411058330513\">of the Czech Television broadcast</a> from that day, we conclude that at the original time of its press conference (2:40 p.m.), the ANO parliamentary group was still deliberating.</p><p> At 12:30, Martin Kolovratník, a member of parliament for ANO, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=862\">uploaded</a> his <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176886\">amendment (.docx) to the proposed amendment</a> to the parliamentary system. At 14:16, member of parliament Pekarová Adamová (TOP 09) uploaded her amendment <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176892\">No. 5248</a> (.docx) and at about the time of the press conference, i.e. at 14:43, 3 more amendments <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176896\">No. 5251</a> (.docx), <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176898\">No. 5252</a> (.docx) and <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176900\">No. 5253</a> (.docx) from member of parliament Profant (Pirates) were already uploaded to the system. As early as May 12, there was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176872\">amendment No. 5225</a> (.docx) from member of parliament Jelínek (SPD). At the time when the ANO parliamentary group was in session, several amendments to the government amendment to the law had already been uploaded to the parliamentary system.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/ischuze.sqw?o=8&amp;s=48&amp;pozvanka=1\">Originally,</a> the agenda of this meeting was to discuss the aforementioned government proposal. Right at the beginning of the meeting, deputies Michálek, Pikal (Pirates), Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) and Okamura (SPD) spoke out against this point. <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/detail.sqw?id=6190\">Deputy Faltýnek</a> (chairman of the ANO parliamentary group) responded <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/048schuz/s048002.htm\">by announcing</a> that at the meeting of the parliamentary group, after which they did not have time to announce this decision to the media at a press conference, they agreed not to discuss this proposal in a state of legislative emergency (in an abbreviated meeting) and to postpone its regular discussion to the next meeting. At the proposal of deputy Michálek, this point was eliminated <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=72987\">by vote</a> no. 3 with the support of 101 out of 107 registered deputies (6 abstained). The next 49th meeting of the PS is scheduled for May 26, 2020, and the first reading of the proposal is tentatively <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/ischuze.sqw?o=8&amp;s=49&amp;pozvanka=1\">scheduled</a> there as point no. 76.</p><p> The gradual recording of amendments could therefore have been one of the reasons why the ANO parliamentary group supported the discussion of the law in the standard procedure.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>In connection with formulating the response to the European Commission&#39;s preliminary audit, which announced the existence of a conflict of interest of Prime Minister Babiš, as well as its final version from December <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-prvni-audit-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_2104232054_tzr\">2019</a> , Minister <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ministerstvo-poslalo-do-bruselu-odpoved-na-audit-k-babisove-stretu-zajmu-40325921\">Dostálová</a> always spoke about the document being processed by officials.

This is money that is redistributed primarily by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.&quot;</i></p><p> However, in the final version of the audit report <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cz_functioning_report/cz_functioning_report_en.pdf\">published by</a> the European Commission (.pdf, pp. 1–2) in April this year, we can also read a list of institutions &quot; <i>involved in the process of managing and distributing subsidies&quot;</i> that were the subject of the audit, and which are therefore the above-mentioned &quot; <i>affected departments&quot;</i> . It is these institutions that communicated with the European Commission.</p><p> In addition to the supra-ministerial <a href=\"https://www.dotacni.info/tag/spolecny-strategicky-ramec/\">Council</a> for the Common Strategic Framework Funds, <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/evropske-fondy-v-cr/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci/pracovni-skupiny/rada-pro-fondy-ssr\">the Council</a> for the ESI Funds and the Steering and Coordination <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/evropske-fondy-v-cr/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci/koordinace/ridici-a-koordinacni-vybor\">Committee,</a> there is the already mentioned National Coordination Body. Three ministries are also listed here: the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of the Environment. In addition to them, the report also lists the Agency for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic, the Agency for Entrepreneurship and Investment Support CzechInvest and the capital city of Prague.</p><p> In total, the audit report <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cz_functioning_report/cz_functioning_report_en.pdf\">lists</a> (.pdf, pp. 1–2) 7 &quot; <i>managing and intermediary institutions&quot;</i> , which include the ministries and agencies just mentioned, and 4 &quot; <i>horizontal institutions&quot;</i> , which include the National Coordination Body and other supra-departmental institutions.</p><p> Minister Dostálová is also right that these are not only ministries led by ministers from the ANO movement. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is led by <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/ministryne\">Jana Maláčová</a> from the ČSSD, and the Mayor of Prague is <a href=\"https://www.praha.eu/jnp/cz/o_meste/primator_a_volene_organy/Primator/vizitka_primatora_hmp/index.html\">Zdeněk Hřib</a> from the Pirate Party.</p><p><br></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
