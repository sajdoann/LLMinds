Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: They state (in the European rules on conflict of interest, note: Demagog.cz) that &quot;participants in financial operations, including national authorities at all levels, involved in the implementation of the budget, shall refrain from any action that could bring their interests into conflict with those of the EU, and shall at the same time take measures to prevent the emergence of a conflict of interest in the functions within their responsibilities.&quot;\nSECTION B: This partial amendment was really only intended to speed up procedures and remove the administrative burden in the so-called negotiated procedure without publication, which is really only for two reasons, that is, we did not change anything in the law, only the negotiated procedure without publication due to extremely urgent circumstances, or if there is only one supplier.\nSECTION C: What we disagree on is that the Ministry of the Interior actually calculated it as if we were building all the offices on a green field, as if there were no construction procedures here. So of course it calculated the new offices for civil servants at 30 billion crowns. Nothing like that will happen and I am sorry that the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior does not state that the state currently pays municipalities for the civil servants who handle construction procedures, for the rental of those rooms, for overheads, and so on. It is not a small amount. The state pays municipalities 4 billion a year. And of that, 360 million is roughly for overheads and rent.\nSECTION D: Tomáš PANCÍŘ, moderator: In the end, your parliamentary group, the parliamentary group of the ANO movement, agreed to postpone the discussion (of the amendments to the Public Procurement Act, note: Demagog.cz) until the regular meeting. Why did you, as ANO, withdraw? (…) Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: (…) Other amendments and suggestions began to be made (…)\nSECTION E: Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: (Andrej Babiš, ed. Dermagog.cz) has fulfilled everything that Czech law requires of him. And Czech officials also claim this. Radek BARTONÍČEK: Officials from your Ministry for Regional Development. Klára DOSTÁLOVÁ: No. They were officials from seven ministries who were preparing the answer. (...) Officials were also from ministries that ANO does not have, or they were from the Prague operational program, where Pirát is the mayor.\nSECTION F: I was not in contact with the auditors at all and I did not participate in any way in the responses to the European Commission. (...) I was not the one who stated, in response to the auditors&#39; criticisms, that in the case of a possible conflict of interest of Prime Minister Babiš, there was no violation of Czech or European laws. (...) I did not decide on the response to the European Commission. Our ministry only sent it because it has the role of the national authority for coordinating finances from EU funds.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

It also concerned widows, widowers, it concerned young people who are still studying, and if we only took the 500 crowns per month for mothers for each child raised, it is an amount that, if I am not mistaken, is somewhere around 10 billion crowns.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

We don&#39;t have the permission of the Libyan government, we don&#39;t have the permission of the UN Security Council, so the admiral is operating in that area, but he can&#39;t fight the smugglers on Libyan territory. So what is he doing? He says here that I have destroyed 551 ships and detained 151 migrants. But he will first save the ship and they are not random castaways, according to maritime law. They go there on purpose, yes. And by the way, there are still those non-profit ships waiting there that send signals: come, come, we are waiting. So they have to transport them to the port, the migrants are excited, within two hours, they have already tried it. They will say, well, that&#39;s the smuggler, he was on the ship with us. The smugglers then go to prison and then they destroy the ship. So this is really not like a systemic solution. There&#39;s a mafia here, they only trade in people and even oil and so on.\nSECTION C: And I would like to show the audience that I made a contract with them here before the elections, in October 2017, and I am fulfilling those points. I pledged that we would never allow illegal migrants into our territory and that we would never agree to the distribution of migrants according to mandatory quotas. I fulfilled that in six months, we enforced that, yes.\nSECTION D: ...and I discussed it with him (Wolfgang Schäuble - note: Demagogue) and he always understood us, he saw it at the press conference and said yes, here is the Czech Republic, and the V4 have a different history, they don&#39;t have the multicultural model and we don&#39;t want it, because the foreigners haven&#39;t been integrated in the individual states. \nSECTION E: And then there is Libya. That is the biggest problem. There is not actually one government there, there are elections coming up, the Libyan guard, which we helped as part of Operation Sofia, is very effective. It is holding the ships, 84% and they didn&#39;t have oil in August. So Prime Minister Conte was dealing with oil, because it is a state-owned company, but the government was not able to force them to give the Libyan guard oil so that they could hold the ships.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
