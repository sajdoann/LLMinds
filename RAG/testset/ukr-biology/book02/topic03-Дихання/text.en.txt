Respiratory system

Before moving on to the study of the human respiratory system, remember what structure the respiratory system of different animals has. How can the features of the vital activity of animals affect the structure of their respiratory system?


The importance of the respiratory systemThe respiratory system provides the human body with oxygen. Using oxygen, cells can obtain much more energy for their vital activity from organic substances. In addition,
gaseous metabolic products


are excreted from the body through the respiratory system .
Nasal cavity Olfactory receptors


Structure of the respiratory system The main organ of human respiration is the lungs, where air enters through other organs of the respiratory system - the nasal cavity, larynx, trachea and bronchi (Fig. 11.2). Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in special sacs - alveoli. Air enters the organs of the respiratory system and is removed with the participation of the intercostal muscles of the trunk and diaphragm.

enters it through the nostrils, where it passes through the nasal passages. The cells of the mucous membrane secrete mucus, which moistens the inhaled air, and a large number of small blood vessels, in which warm blood flows, warms it. Mucus also disinfects the air due to the presence of lysozyme in it. In addition, the nasal cavity is an organ of smell.

LarynxThe larynx (Fig. 11.3) is a structure that connects the nasal and oral cavities with the following sections of the respiratory system. It is formed by movably connected cartilages and attached muscles and ligaments. The larynx provides the passage of air to the trachea and separates the respiratory and digestive systems. To prevent food from entering the respiratory tract during swallowing, the larynx is closed by a special cartilage - the epiglottis. An important function of the larynx is to ensure the generation of sounds: the sounds we pronounce arise precisely in this organ.

elasticity of this wall a lump of food can move freely through the esophagus. On the inner surface of the trachea are cells of the ciliated epithelium. With the help of the movements of their cilia, dust and dirt that settle on its walls are removed from the trachea. The main function of the trachea is to ensure the passage of air from the larynx to the bronchi and back.


Bronchi Bronchi are airways that depart from the trachea (Fig. 11.5). They are similar to the trachea and contain cartilaginous semi-rings, but the diameter of the bronchi is smaller. The bronchi pass into the lungs, where they branch, forming a bronchial tree. Their final branches are called bronchioles. The bronchioles pass into alveolar ducts, on the walls of which are located alveoli - pulmonary alveoli (Fig. 11.6). The main task of the bronchi is to ensure the passage of air from the trachea to the alveoli and back.


LungsThe lungs are paired respiratory organs that provide gas exchange between blood and air. The right lung consists of three lobes, and the left lung consists of two. On the inner surface of these organs are the gates of the lungs, through which the bronchi, blood vessels and nerves pass. The lungs are covered with a special connective tissue membrane - the pleura, which has a complex structure.


44. Respiratory system


The pleura consists of two sheets - the outer and inner. Between them is a thin layer of fluid, which is secreted by capillaries
and absorbed by the lymphatic vessels of the pleura. The outer layer
of the pleura is attached to the inner surface of the chest cavity, and the inner layer is attached to the surface of the lungs. The smallest structure of the lungs are the alveoli - very small (200–300 microns) hemispherical formations. They are separated from each other by thin (2–8 microns) partitions. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of capillaries.


Behind the palate, a person has a small appendage called the uvula, which separates the throat and pharynx. Its main function is to close the nasopharynx when a person swallows or speaks. The uvula also controls the passage of food into the digestive tract.


Carbon dioxide in exhaled air is 100 times more than in atmospheric air.


The lung volume of most people is 3–4 liters. It is usually proportional to the size of the body and can be 6 liters in adult men. The lung volume of women is on average smaller, because their body size is also smaller. Living conditions can also affect lung volume. People who live high above sea level have a larger lung volume. This is an adaptation of the body to living in conditions of more rarefied air.


The respiratory process in humans is provided by the organs of the respiratory system. These include the nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Gas exchange between air and blood takes place in the lungs. Other organs of the respiratory system ensure that air enters the lungs and returns to the external environment..TOPIC 3


How the respiratory system works


12


Before proceeding to study the work of the human respiratory system, remember which organs are part of it. What functions do these organs perform? How does the human respiratory system differ from the respiratory system of birds?


What is respiration? Respiration is a set of processes that ensure the entry of oxygen into the body, its use in oxidative processes, and the removal of carbon dioxide from the body. External and internal respiration are distinguished. External respiration is the exchange of gases between the blood and atmospheric air that occurs in the respiratory organs. Internal respiration is oxidative processes in cells, as a result of which energy is released. In the human body, external respiration occurs in several stages: 1. The arrival of fresh air rich in oxygen to the respiratory surface due to respiratory movements. 2. Diffusion of oxygen through the walls of the alveoli into the blood. 3. Transport of gases by the circulatory system of the body. 4. Exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen between cells and blood, which is carried out by diffusion through the walls of cells.


Thoracic and abdominal breathing The diaphragm and muscles of the trunk, primarily the intercostal muscles, participate in the breathing process. Depending on which of them is the main action, abdominal and thoracic breathing are distinguished. During abdominal breathing, the muscular effort created by the diaphragm prevails in the act of exhalation, and during thoracic breathing, the muscular effort created by the intercostal muscles prevails. The pleura, a membrane that covers the lungs from the outside and consists of two sheets, plays an extremely important role in the breathing process. The inner pleura covers the lungs, and the outer pleura lines the chest cavity. Between these layers is a thin space with a small
amount of fluid.

Lungs contract


How inhalation and exhalation occur During inhalation, the diaphragm, which has a dome-shaped shape, contracts and becomes flatter. The intercostal muscles also contract and raise the ribs. As a result, the internal volume of the chest cavity increases. At the same time, the outer pleura moves away from the inner one, but since the space between them
is sealed, a zone of low pressure arises here
. Meanwhile, the pressure inside the lungs is equal to atmospheric (because the lungs are connected to the atmosphere). Due to the pressure difference, the lungs stretch, and air enters them from the outside (Fig. 12.1). During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes, becomes dome-shaped again, and presses on the lungs from below. At the same time, the intercostal muscles relax, and the ribs, under the influence of gravity, fall down. The volume of the chest decreases, it presses on the walls of the lungs. Under the pressure of the diaphragm and chest, air is pushed out of the lungs. Thus, the pressure inside the lungs equalizes with atmospheric pressure.


The diaphragm is relaxed

How gas exchange occurs Gas exchange between air and blood occurs in the alveoli. In total, there are about 700 million alveoli in the lungs, and their total surface area in different people ranges from 60 to 120 m 2 . It is thanks to such a large area that gas exchange occurs very quickly. Oxygen from the air that reaches the alveoli dissolves in the liquid that covers their surface. Then, as a result of the diffusion process, oxygen enters the capillaries located near the surface of the alveoli.
Blood cells, erythrocytes, contain the protein hemoglobin, which captures
oxygen and transports it to the cells of the body. When erythrocytes enter the capillaries of the tissues, gas exchange occurs in the tissues. Oxygen from the erythrocytes passes into the tissue fluid, and from there into the tissue cells. Carbon dioxide enters the capillaries from the tissue fluid.

How sounds are formed One of the main functions of the human respiratory system is the formation of sounds. It is thanks to the organs of this system that we can speak. The organs involved in the formation of the voice are the larynx, pharynx, nasal cavity, oral cavity, tongue, lips, teeth, jaws. But the main role in this process is played by the vocal cords of the larynx (Fig. 12.2). The vocal cords consist of elastic elastic fibers. They are stretched across the larynx parallel to each other, and between them is the glottis. The tension of the vocal cords is regulated by the muscles attached to them. The voice is produced when exhaled air passes through the glottis, which causes the tense ligaments to vibrate. The pitch of the voice increases with an increase in the frequency of the vibrations of the vocal cords. The formation of sounds is controlled by speech centers - groups of cells

Ventilation of the lungs in a healthy person reaches 5–9 liters per minute.


The Adam's apple is a convex part of the cartilage that covers the larynx. The size of the Adam's apple is determined by the size of the larynx and is a hereditary trait. Its development depends on the action of hormones, the effect of which begins during puberty. In men, the Adam's apple is noticeably larger than in women.


Voice mutation is a sharp and frequent change in the pitch of the voice that occurs during puberty in boys. This change is caused by the intensive growth of the larynx during this period of development.


When hemoglobin in the blood combines with oxygen during breathing, this compound is unstable. But if carbon monoxide (CO) enters the circulatory system instead of oxygen, the consequences are extremely unpleasant. This compound forms a very strong bond with hemoglobin that is difficult to break. As a result, hemoglobin loses its ability to carry oxygen, so even a small amount of carbon monoxide in the blood is dangerous to human life.


Whispering is a quiet speech in which words are pronounced without the participation of the vocal cords. During a whisper, the ligaments do not vibrate, as in normal speech. But they come closer, and the air rubs against the edge of the glottis. All other parts of the human vocal apparatus work as usual. There are three types of whispering - quiet, moderate and loud.


The human breathing process is mainly ensured
by the movements of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. The pleura plays an extremely important role in this. The vocal cords, which are located in the larynx, play a major role in the formation of the voice. TOPIC 3


Regulation of breathing and the main functional indicators of the respiratory system

How breathing is regulated The respiratory center, which controls the work of the human respiratory system, is located in the medulla oblongata. It sends signals to the muscles that provide respiratory movements (Fig. 13.1). The work of the respiratory center itself can be influenced by both nerve signals and certain substances. Sensitive cells (receptors) of the respiratory center respond to the content of carbon dioxide in the blood. If there is too much of it, the center gives a signal to increase the respiratory rate. When a person suddenly falls into cold water or inhales very odorous substances, signals from other parts of the brain force the respiratory center to give an order to hold their breath. This is a reflex action that occurs without the participation of consciousness. It is necessary in order to prevent water or aggressive substances in the air from entering the lungs. Reflex actions also include such reflexes of the respiratory system as sneezing and coughing. Sneezing occurs in case of mild irritation of the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx, and coughing - in case of irritation of the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Both of these reflexes are associated with a sharp contraction of muscles and rapid exhalation. They are protective and aimed at removing foreign substances or objects from the respiratory tract.

. Respiratory regulation and basic functional indicators of the respiratory system


Basic functional indicators of the respiratory system The properties of the respiratory systems differ in different people. The reason for this is heredity and differences in lifestyle. Constant loads and exercises contribute to the development of the respiratory organs and increase the efficiency of their work. Special functional indicators are used to assess the state of the human respiratory system. These indicators allow you to assess both the state of human health in general and the state of his respiratory system in particular. What these indicators are, find out from the table.


Functional indicators of the respiratory system


Functional indicatorCharacteristic


Vital capacity of the lungs (VLC) The maximum amount of air exhaled after the deepest inhalation. VC is the sum of the volumes of several other functional indicators: reserve, respiratory and supplementary


Tidal volumeThe volume of air entering the lungs (or being removed from them) during each inhalation (exhalation)


Reserve volumeThe volume of air that can additionally enter the lungs during the deepest exhalation


Supplementary volumeThe
volume of air that can additionally enter the lungs during the deepest inhalation


Residual volumeThe volume of air remaining in the lungs after maximum exhalation


Dead spaceThe volume of air contained in the airways


The regulation of the respiratory system is provided by the respiratory center, which is located in the medulla oblongata. It is carried out with the help of both nerve impulses and substances carried by the blood. To assess the condition of the respiratory system organs, functional indicators are used, such as, for example, vital capacity of the lungs..TOPIC 3


Diseases of the respiratory system organs

Before proceeding to the study of disorders of the human respiratory system, remember which organs are part of it. What functions does it perform? What parasitic organisms can penetrate the human body through the respiratory system?

Fig. 14.2. Tuberculosis pathogen


Fig. 14.3. Diphtheria pathogen


Respiratory system diseases Respiratory system diseases can occur for various reasons. For example, tracheitis is inflammation of the trachea, and bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi. These diseases can be caused by both microorganisms (bacteria or viruses) and certain chemicals (allergens). The cause of a number of respiratory system diseases is also the action of microscopic fungi. They can either directly affect the respiratory system or cause allergic reactions. Pathogenic microorganisms (Fig. 14.1–14.3) can easily penetrate directly into the human body through the respiratory system. In addition, since pathogens of respiratory diseases spread by airborne droplets, this allows them to be quickly transmitted from one person to another. For example, when sneezing or coughing, for example, in transport, the pathogen can easily enter the bodies of several people at once. Therefore, it is very important to determine the onset of the disease in time and prevent its development and infection of other people. It should also be noted that some diseases of the respiratory system can be caused not only by the action of living organisms, but also by the influence of the external environment (asthma, bronchitis, tracheitis, etc.). These are the so-called allergic diseases. See the table for the most common disorders of the respiratory system.

Significant increase in body temperature, severe chills, cough, pain in the side, shallow, accelerated breathing


Development of inflammatory processes in the lungs caused by various bacteria or viruses under the influence of severe hypothermia, significant physical and neuropsychic overloads, intoxications and other factors that reduce immunity


Main measures for the prevention of respiratory diseases The ways in which various infectious agents and harmful substances enter the respiratory organs are very similar, therefore the main measures for prevention are the same: vaccination (prophylactic vaccinations); quarantine (avoiding contact with sick people); compliance with personal hygiene rules;


53. Topic 3


regular medical check-ups;
increasing the body's resistance level (hardening, balanced
nutrition, etc.). The most universal preventive measure from the above list is increasing the body's resistance. This measure does not require any special efforts. You just need to lead a healthy lifestyle, harden the body and eat normally (without overeating or malnutrition). But this measure protects very effectively. Vaccination is another reliable way to prevent respiratory diseases. But it does not work the same against all infections. If after vaccination against diphtheria the body will be protected for a long time, then with the flu everything is not so simple. The causative agent of flu is very variable: new forms of it constantly appear. Therefore, the vaccines that are being developed do not help against all variants of the virus. In the event of a flu epidemic, the vaccine should be used against the variant of the flu virus that is spreading at the moment. Tuberculosis is still quite difficult to cure. This is exactly the disease that is easier to prevent than to cure. Therefore, the best way to combat it is a medical examination (regular - once a year - undergoing fluorography).


The negative impact of smoking on the respiratory system


a


b


You already know that the substances contained in tobacco have a detrimental effect on various organ systems. However, they enter the body precisely through the organs of the respiratory system. Therefore, these organs suffer most from smoking. Smoking can cause lung cancer or other respiratory tract cancer. Do not forget that under the influence of tobacco smoke, the vocal cords
lose their elasticity, which leads to
a change in the voice. Another very unpleasant consequence of smoking is the negative impact of tobacco smoke on the ciliated epithelium of the trachea and bronchi. Due to the action of smoke, the epithelial cells lose the ability to perform their work normally - to remove foreign particles, dust and dirt that enter them with air from the respiratory tract along with mucus. This is why many smokers often cough.

54. Diseases of the respiratory system


Negative impact of environmental factors on the respiratory system


Not only smoking can negatively affect the state of the respiratory system. Take for example environmental factors, both organic and inorganic. For example, the presence of a large amount of dust in the air inhaled by a person can lead to the development of silicosis. This disease causes destruction of lung tissue and is incurable. It most often occurs in workers in the mining and engineering industries, as well as in people who deal with refractory and ceramic materials. Organic components of the environment can also affect the respiratory system. Allergic aspergillosis is a very dangerous phenomenon. It is caused by spores of the mold fungi Aspergillus,
which affect people with reduced immunity. It was from aspergillosis
that the robbers of the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs often died. This led to the emergence of legends about the “curse of the pharaohs,” which punished the robbers.


Diseases of the respiratory system can be caused by both pathogenic organisms and harmful substances. Common diseases of the respiratory system are influenza, diphtheria, bronchitis, tuberculosis, asthma, pneumonia, etc. Smoking causes significant damage to the respiratory system.
