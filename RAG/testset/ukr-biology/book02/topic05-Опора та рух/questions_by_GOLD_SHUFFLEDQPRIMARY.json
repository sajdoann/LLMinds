    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: When I recently told him (the director of the BIS Koudelka, note: Demagog.cz) that he should deal more with economic crime, the BIS spokesperson said that economic crime is not in the BIS job description, which means we have a stupid spokesperson here who doesn&#39;t even know the BIS Act, which includes the obligation to protect the economic interests of the Czech Republic. And tell me, what else but economic crime, including corruption and the fight against it, is the defense of economic interests.\nSECTION B: So I have problems with compulsory voting. I&#39;ll ignore the stupid argument that the communists introduced it. By the way, you know, right? On the contrary, they abolished Masaryk&#39;s law on compulsory voting and formally and only formally, voting was not compulsory. But something else is that under the communists, voting was enforced quite drastically, although not by law.\n\n\nSECTION C: Danuška, Dana Košanová, my little daughter, go to sleep already. I think that was a poem by Vojtěch Mihálik, who later deserted to the regime, but wrote this beautiful poem at the time. Do you know who Dana Košanová was? She has a monument now and she was shot by a Soviet soldier, no tank, Mr. Soukup, normal shooting. I don&#39;t even know if it was from behind.\nSECTION D: There were some property disputes there (at TV NOVA, note: Demagog.cz) and unfortunately we had to pay a fine of 10 billion crowns also because some institution, I don&#39;t know now if it was the media committee of the Chamber of Deputies or someone like that, said that everything was fine. So we agreed to it, and well, it wasn&#39;t fine.\nSECTION E: Well, I recommended quite publicly when he was appointed (Minister of Culture Zaorálek, note: Demagog.cz) that he realize that he can have a comfortable life, going from reception to reception, from opening to opening, from festival to festival, but that the Ministry of Culture should take care of dilapidated cultural monuments.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

This “intergroup” is one of the oldest, first established in 1980.</p><p> After the last elections to the European Parliament, an initiative was taken <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/newsroom/news/european-disability-movement-calls-reestablishment-disability-intergroup-european\">to revive</a> this group in the new composition of the Parliament. The exact sequence of events and negotiations between the EU Disability Forum (EDF, an umbrella organization that helps people with disabilities) and the MEPs is not available, but Radka Maxová, who attended the negotiations and supports the establishment of the group, can also be considered the initiator of the establishment of the Disability Intergroup in the European Parliament.</p><p> If Maxová is talking in her statement about the MPs she managed to recruit for this group, or about the date of the group&#39;s establishment, then we were unable to verify these parts of the statement from public sources.

It states the government&#39;s commitment &quot; <em>We will increase the parental allowance to CZK 300,000.&quot;</em> It currently (per child) is <a href=\"https://portal.mpsv.cz/soc/ssp/obcane/rodicovsky_prisp\">CZK 220,000</a> . From 2020, preparations are underway to increase the parental allowance to the aforementioned <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2916452-rodicovska-se-zrejme-vyrazne-zmeni-tak-jako-u-materske-davka-mohla-vychazet-z-vyse\">CZK 300,000</a> .</p><p> There was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit\">agreement</a> across the political spectrum on increasing the parental allowance, however, there was disagreement on the key to increase the parental allowance and for whom. There were three options:</p><ol><li> Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Jana Maláčová (ČSSD) <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit\">proposed</a> that the increased benefit apply to all parents whose children will be under 4 years old as of January 1, 2020. This option would mean an increase in budget costs of CZK 11.2 billion.</li><li> Minister of Finance Alena Schillerová (ANO) <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit\">proposed</a> that the increased benefit apply to all parents who would be actively receiving parental allowance as of January 1, 2020. This option would be more economical by CZK 2.6 billion compared to option 1 and would mean an increase in budget costs by CZK 8.6 billion.</li><li> Another option and compromise <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2768231-komu-se-zvysi-rodicovska-vladni-navrh-se-vraci-na-stul-ministryne-financi\">option</a> resulting from the coalition negotiations was the possibility of increasing the benefit for all parents whose child is born after January 1, 2020. This would represent a saving of approximately CZK 5.5 billion in the state budget compared to option 2 and an increase in budget costs of CZK 3 billion.</li></ol><p> In March, Minister Maláčová <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2764631-rust-rodicovske-a-duchodu-mohla-podporit-i-opozice-ne-ale-variantu-domluvenou-a\">announced</a> that the coalition partners had agreed to implement a third option, which was subsequently denied by both Prime Minister Babiš and MP Maxová, saying that the agreement between the parties was different.</p><p> The individual coalition parties then stood by their proposals (ČSSD for the first option, ANO for the second option) and exchanged messages with each other through the media (e.g. <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2812658-zakon-o-rodicovske-predlozi-cssd-uz-za-tyden-nechceme-aby-se-navyseni-nestihlo\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819351-novy-rozpocet-bude-mit-schodek-40-miliard-sektorova-dan-nebude-banky-ale-maji\">here</a> ). <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2769701-zive-o-kolik-se-zvednou-duchody-o-jejich-zvyseni-jednala-vlada\"></a> , who and where has the savings to find the money for the announced increases, because the state budget deficit has already been announced at <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819351-novy-rozpocet-bude-mit-schodek-40-miliard-sektorova-dan-nebude-banky-ale-maji\">CZK 40 billion</a> and it should not have been exceeded.</p><p> There was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819144-rodicovska-na-programu-vlady-malacova-prichazi-s-kompromisem-potrebuje-osm-miliard\">an option</a> to divide the increase in the allowance: in the first half of 2019 there would be an increase of CZK 40,000, and by the end of the election period there would then be a planned full increase of another CZK 40,000. However, MP Maxová supported the option of a one-time increase: &quot; <em>I personally would probably prefer the option that children whose parents receive parental allowance receive it, and spread the 80,000 according to the length of time they have been drawing parental allowance.&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/pretahovani-o-rodicovskou-kdo-to-mysli-s-rodinami-lepe-malacova-nebo-babis-69733\">Duel Seznam Zprávy</a> , time 1:40)</p><p> The bill was finally submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/ALBSBCDM5SWO\">a second version</a> (.doc, page 8) with a one-time increase of CZK 80,000 and passed <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=490\">its second reading</a> in the Chamber of Deputies in September.</p><p> For the sake of completeness, let us add that MP Maxová was the chairwoman of the Social Policy Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic, but her <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2863985-zive-snemovna-resi-zvyseni-rodicovskeho-prispevku-i-oteviraci-dobu-obchodu\">mandate as a member of parliament expired</a> in July because she became an MEP, and she therefore no longer participated <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=70821\">in the vote</a> on the amendment to the law.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Representatives of the ANO movement are part of the Renew Europe (formerly ALDE) faction in the European Parliament. No internal communication regarding the European Parliament resolution on the conflict of interest of Andrej Babiš has been published. In general, the Renew Europe faction has not commented on this topic on its <a href=\"https://reneweuropegroup.eu/en/news/\">website</a> , <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RenewEurope/\">social networks</a> or otherwise. Of the total number of <a href=\"https://reneweuropegroup.eu/en/about-us/our-meps/\">98</a> MEPs in this faction, 72 MEPs voted for the entire resolution ( <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/PV-9-2020-06-19-RCV_FR.pdf\">.pdf, p. 316</a> ).</p><p> Only the statement of MEP and member of this faction Radka Maxová is available. In an interview with Seznam Zprávy, she <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/babisova-europoslankyne-resim-jestli-setrvani-v-ano-je-pro-me-jeste-unosne-109740\">stated</a> that she did not agree with voting on the resolution as a whole, and that it would be appropriate to vote on certain parts ( <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2020-0164_CS.html\">part A and paragraphs 11, 14, 20, 21, 49</a> ) separately.</p><p> Whether there were discussions within the faction about whether it would be appropriate to vote on certain parts separately and whether the faction supported this proposal cannot be verified due to the lack of sources. However, in the end it was indeed <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/cs/press-room/20200615IPR81227/parlament-zada-vysetreni-mozneho-stretu-zajmu-ceskeho-premiera\">a resolution</a> as a whole.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The proposal to increase parental allowance <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=490\">passed</a> its second reading in the Chamber of Deputies on 25 September 2019. It is intended <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=161461\">to increase</a> (.pdf, p. 2, point 4) parental allowance by 80 thousand, from 220 thousand to 300 thousand crowns. In addition, the European Parliament Directive on work-life balance for parents and carers <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158\">was passed</a> on 20 June 2019. This directive is to be implemented by 2 August 2022 in all Member States (Article 20) and, for example, extends the length of paternity leave to 10 days, which is an extension of <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/otcovska-dovolena-se-prodlouzi-na-deset-dnu/r~03b973acb82f11e9b16b0cc47ab5f122/\">three</a> days.</p><p> As for the change in maternity leave, MEP Maxová probably means the changes described in Article 5 of this <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158\">directive</a> . According to it, each parent is entitled to 4 months of parental leave. Two of these months are non-transferable and, according to Article 8, also paid. According to the directive, parental leave can also be conditioned by the total time worked or the duration of the employment relationship. However, this period may not exceed 1 year.</p><p> In response to this directive and the increase in parental allowance, Radka Maxová has already expressed herself in the past and even then demanded a systemic <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/radka-maxova-rodice-volaji-hlavne-po-moznostech-skloubeni-pracovniho-a-rodinneho-7801534\">change</a> (video 10:40): &quot; <em>We wanted Minister Maláčová to say that if we were going to add this amount, then there needed to be a systemic change in the support for families from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. And that maybe we could talk about, could talk about, postponing the increase. So that it would be combined with work and private life, with the financing of children&#39;s groups, actually with the relationship to the directive that will be approved by the European Parliament</em> .&quot;</p><p> However, there has been no systemic change, i.e. a comprehensive amendment that would comprehensively regulate the individual institutions supporting working parents, including, for example, in connection with the aforementioned European directive. Individual areas are therefore amended separately, within separate amendments.</p><p> In addition to the amount of parental allowance, adjustments are also expected for children&#39;s groups. Children&#39;s groups <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/deti-jesle-platit-skupiny-prispevky.A190522_093831_domaci_elz\">are</a> places where children can be placed before starting kindergarten. There are currently 959 of these places in the Czech Republic with a capacity of over 14 thousand children. However, these children&#39;s groups are paid for from European funds, which will end after 2020 (groups that have applied for this will be funded until 2022).</p><p> The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs wants children&#39;s groups to be paid for from the state budget from <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2931710-jesle-se-vraci-malacova-chce-prejmenovat-detske-skupiny-a-hradit-je-z-rozpoctu\">2021</a> .</p><p> With the support of workers, one can also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske\">imagine</a> the emergence of part-time work. In the European Union, the Czech Republic <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-66249480-zapad-eu-valcuje-vychodni-zeme-bloku-v-podilu-lidi-pracujicich-na-zkraceny-uvazek-cesko-je-ve-srovnani-mezi-poslednimi\">is</a> among the countries with a lower popularity of part-time work. The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/jana-malacova-mpsv-castecny-uvazek-novela-zakonik-prace_1907161848_per\">expressed</a> a positive opinion on part-time work and stated that she is preparing an amendment to the Labor Code, which would include, among other things, the establishment of a shared job, which should support part-time work so that people can more easily have, for example, a twenty-hour workday.</p><p> VAT on home childcare services is also to <a href=\"https://www.finance.cz/527687-nizsi-dph-u-piva-holicky/\">be reduced</a> , which is another item that Radka Maxová <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske\">mentioned</a> in the context of increasing the parental allowance. However, the VAT reduction <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2019/novela-zakona-o-evidenci-trzeb-miri-do-t-34995\">does not</a> include tax on children&#39;s needs.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because all the above-mentioned changes were not linked together. This procedure can therefore be described as non-systematic, given that the individual amendments are being prepared gradually and independently of each other. The situation will also be affected by the European Parliament directive, which is to be implemented by August 2022, children&#39;s groups will then be funded by the state possibly from 2021, but the so-called micro-nurseries ( <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2741900-na-mikrojeslich-si-rodice-oblibili-hlavne-osobnejsi-pristup-k-detem-vznikaji-i-v\">nurseries with</a> a maximum of four children) have still not been resolved. The VAT reduction for home childcare services is then prepared, but the tax reduction for children&#39;s needs has not yet been adopted at all.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

Dana Košanová&#39;s name is listed on a memorial <a href=\"http://multimedia.ctk.cz/foto/document/2072179/2\">plaque</a> at the entrance to the Faculty of Law of Comenius University.</p><p> Vojtech Mihálik responded suggestively to the entry of Soviet troops and the tragic death of student Dana Košanová in his poem <em>Requiem</em> , <a href=\"https://is.muni.cz/th/m54go/DiseDise_240918.pdf\">published</a> (p. 163) on September 5, 1968 in a special edition of the weekly <em>Nové slovo.</em> With the help of the library staff of the Faculty of Social Sciences of Charles University, we managed to obtain the original text of the poem, from which President Zeman correctly quoted the part that deals with the murder of Dana Košanová.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>President Miloš Zeman, at a meeting with foreign ambassadors on October 27, 2019, did indeed begin <a href=\"https://www.hrad.cz/cs/prezident-cr/soucasny-prezident-cr/vybrane-projevy-a-rozhovory/projev-prezidenta-republiky-pri-setkani-se-cleny-diplomatickeho-sboru-15112\">his speech</a> with almost identical words: <em>&quot;Distinguished ambassadors, dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends of the Czech Republic, welcome to a successful country! Welcome to a country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, stable economic growth, and very low national debt.&quot;</em> He did not mention the declining national debt at the time.</p><p> We consider the opening words to be true in terms of content as well. The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is indeed the lowest in the European Union. According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics\">Eurostat data from October 2019</a> , it is 2.2%, while the average unemployment rate in the EU-28 is 6.3%.</p><p> If we measure economic growth by GDP, then the Czech Republic is truly in a period of growth. According to <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/92010940/chmu100119.xlsx/d8a25f9f-e671-4fd1-a1f7-0b090610fbbd?version=1.0\">Czech Statistical Office data</a> (.xlsx), GDP has been growing by at least 2.5% year-on-year since 2013.</p><p> President Miloš Zeman says that the state debt is relatively decreasing and low. It is true that in relative terms of state debt to GDP, the debt is indeed decreasing. As can be seen <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">in Eurostat data</a> , this trend has been evident since 2013, when the debt was at 44.9%. In 2018, the share of state debt to GDP was 32.6%. However, in absolute numbers, state debt is not clearly decreasing, on the contrary, it is rather fluctuating, which can be traced <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/rizeni-statniho-dluhu/dluhova-statistika/struktura-a-vyvoj-statniho-dluhu\">in the data of the Ministry of Finance</a> . According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">Eurostat data,</a> the debt of the Czech Republic is one of the lowest in the EU. The average share of state debt to GDP in the EU is 80.4%. Estonia and Bulgaria, for example, have lower relative state debt than the Czech Republic.</p><p> The average wage growth is reported <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/prace_a_mzdy_prace\">by the Czech Statistical Office</a> . In the 3rd quarter of 2019, the average wage reached CZK 33,697 (increased by 6.9% year-on-year).</p><p> The growth of old-age pensions can be monitored, for example, <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/statni-rozpocet/hospodareni-systemu-duchodoveho-pojisten\">on data from the Ministry of Finance</a> . In 2016, the average old-age pension was CZK 11,460, in 2017 it was CZK 11,850, and in 2018 the average old-age pension reached CZK 12,418.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>To evaluate this statement, we will use only a quote from the Constitution of the Czech Republic. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl68\">Article 68</a> , which states:</p><p> <i>“(1) The Government is responsible to the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> <i>(2) The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President of the Republic and, upon his proposal, shall appoint the other members of the Government and entrust them with the management of ministries or other offices.</i></p><p> <i>(3) The Government shall appear before the Chamber of Deputies within thirty days of its appointment and request a vote of confidence.</i></p><p> <i>(4) If the newly appointed government does not gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the procedure shall be as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. If the government thus appointed also fails to gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Republic shall appoint the Prime Minister on the proposal of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> It is precisely the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned article in the Constitution that describes that in the event of a vote of no confidence being cast on the first attempt, the same procedure is followed again. However, if a vote of no confidence is cast on the second attempt, a third attempt follows, during which the power to select the Prime Minister lies with the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> Let us add that this constitutional procedure gives the President of the Republic considerable room for discretion. In particular, the Constitution does not dictate to the President who should be appointed Prime Minister in each attempt to form a government. As a rule, this is the chairman of the party that won the election, but as Miloš Zeman mentions in a verified interview, the coalition potential of individual parliamentary parties also plays a role. Let us recall the parliamentary elections in 2010, when the ČSSD won, but President Klaus instead of Bohuslav Sobotka <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sanci-vyjednat-vladu-ma-necas-sobotku-klaus-zklamal/r~i:article:670008/\">entrusted</a> the formation of the government to the chairman of <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2010/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">the second</a> ODS, Petr Nečas, whom he subsequently <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/klaus-jmenoval-necase-premierem-45608\">appointed</a> Prime Minister.</p><p> A similar case occurred in 2013 after the fall of the Nečas government, when the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Miroslava Němcová had 101 parliamentary signatures in support of a possible new government, but President Zeman instead <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1090181-vladu-sestavi-ekonom-rusnok-rozhodl-zeman\">tasked</a> Jiří Rusnok with forming a caretaker government and subsequently <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/-vladu-odborniku-povede-rusnok-prezident-zeman-ho-jmenoval-premierem_201306251920_mskalicky\">appointed</a> him prime minister.</p><p> Even in the second attempt to appoint a prime minister who will form a government with confidence, there is no stipulation as to who should be appointed, especially that it should be the “second in line.” In 2018, for example, President Zeman <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/premier-andrej-babis-prezident-milos-zeman-podruhe_1806061400_ako\">appointed</a> Andrej Babiš as prime minister even after his government failed to win confidence in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The ruling <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-za-novu-do-konce-dubna.A030318_144623_domaci_has\">refers</a> to property disputes from 1999 to 2003 between TV Nova CEO Vladimír Železný (or CET 21, the broadcasting license <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/zelezny-prejmenuje-cet-21-na-tv-nova.A_990419_170757_domaci_jpl\">holder</a> ) and American investors (CME). CME claims that its investments in TV Nova were <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/cesko-musi-cme-zaplatit-10-miliard-korun_200303151837_mtaborska\">damaged</a> by Vladimír Železný&#39;s attempt to cut off foreign investors.</p><p> CEO Železný was <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-kvuli-nove-miliardy.A030314_200747_domaci_jpl\">supported</a> in his attempt to spin off TV Nova from CME in 1999 by the Radio and Television Broadcasting Council, which is vaguely referred to in the ruling. These circumstances resulted in arbitration proceedings (or arbitral proceedings) that ended against the Czech Republic, which had <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/assets/cs/media/Dohoda_DPOI-USA-cesky.pdf\">an obligation</a> (.pdf) to protect American foreign investments. The victorious company CME <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/rozhodnuto-cesko-za-arbitraz-zaplatilo.A030515_095759_domaci_has\">received</a> over 10 billion crowns from the state in the arbitration dispute.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>General Motors is an American multinational corporation that is one of the world&#39;s largest car manufacturers. However, it ran into major problems, among other things due to the effects of the global economic crisis of 2008. GM has had enough of its own problems over the past decade, such as a constantly declining market share, with the price per share gradually <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/05/31/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy_looms/index.htm?postversion=2009053112\">falling</a> to almost 75 cents. </p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/chart_gm_shrinking.03.gif\"><figcaption> Source: <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/\">CNN</a></figcaption></figure><p> But the Great Recession also meant that car sales dropped significantly. All of these factors led GM to declare <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/ceska-ekonomika/obri-bankrot-automobilky-je-tu-gm-chce-ochranu/r~i:article:638814/?redirected=1532723355\">bankruptcy</a> on June 1, 2009. On the same day, the company filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. The administration of then-President Barack Obama bailed out GM with a nearly $50 billion <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">injection</a> of cash, for which it acquired a 60.8% stake in the company. Canada also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1405425-automobilka-general-motors-zbankrotovala\">bought</a> part of the company, and the United Auto Workers union bought another part. The United States then gradually sold off this stake, for which it collected $39 billion. The last part of its stake <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/12/09/government-treasury-gm-general-motors-tarp-bailout-exit-sale/3925515/\">was sold by</a> the United States in December 2013.</p><p> General Motors remained in bankruptcy for only 39 days and soon returned to the stock market thanks to reorganization. As part of the restructuring, the company <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">stopped</a> production of some unprofitable brands such as Hummer, Pontiac and Saturn. The company also closed some of its factories and focused on a narrower selection of brands - such as Chevrolet and Cadillac. The US entry into car manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler ultimately saved 1.5 million jobs. It is estimated that the US <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-bailout-study-idUSL1N0JO0XU20131209\">saved</a> $ 105 billion in collecting social security payments and social benefits for people who would have lost their jobs due to the bankruptcy.</p><p> The Czech Republic can help Czech companies in this way. <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66746670-vlada-hodla-vstoupit-do-vyznamnych-soukromych-firem\">According to</a> Deputy Prime Minister Karel Havlíček, this would be a similar model to that outlined by Miloš Zeman using the example of the USA and General Motors. &quot; <i>We call it the American model, it is not socialization, as we are now being criticized a lot.&quot;</i> Many states are trying to save their strategic companies in this way, as are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesasquith/2020/04/01/could-airlines-be-nationalised-as-italy-takes-full-ownership-of-alitalia-will-more-airlines-follow/#59f3640877df\">airlines</a> .</p><p> Finance Minister Alena Schillerová and the government of Andrej Babiš have <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66751220-schillerova-chce-zestatnovat\">proposed</a> that shares in some Czech companies, such as CSA, should be bought back and then <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66749800-deficit-200-miliard-i-pristi-rok\">sold</a> again, following the American model. Czech Airlines <a href=\"https://www.lidovky.cz/byznys/doprava/zachrana-csa-verdikt-zrejme-padne-do-dvou-tydnu.A200416_130657_ln-doprava_ele\">is</a> currently 98 percent owned by Smartwings, 49 percent of which is owned by the Chinese state-owned company CITIC. However, this proposal is criticized by many economists and experts who do not consider CSA to be a strategic enterprise, and <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/koronahelpdesk-e15/v-cesku-zadna-strategicka-firma-ke-znarodneni-neni-shoduje-se-opozice-s-analytiky-1368824\">the opposition</a> is also opposed. Petr Bartoň, the chief economist of the Natland group, compared the situation between CSA and GM for <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/znarodneni-csa-nic-neresi-rika-ekonom-40321128\">Novinky.cz</a> : &quot; <i>The management is not in a state of catastrophic failure and it is not an irreplaceable critical infrastructure. CSA was only prohibited from offering its services. There would be demand, but citizens are prohibited from traveling anywhere. This can be solved with existing programs to maintain economic relations for the rest of the economy. That is, if those programs were sufficient.&quot;</i></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
