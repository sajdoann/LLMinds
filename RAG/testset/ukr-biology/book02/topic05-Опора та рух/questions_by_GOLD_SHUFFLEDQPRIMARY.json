Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: HAVLÍČEK: (...) and then we have NÚKIB, an independent institution. TAKÁČ, moderator: Who stated what he stated that it is a security risk (Huawei, note: Demagog.cz). HAVLÍČEK: Yes, he stated it at the end of last year. At the moment, if I have the correct information, an audit of all devices is actually underway at the state level.\nSECTION B: ALSO, moderator: And the European Union, the European Commission appreciated it? You said. Does that mean some philosophical reservation like: no nuclear, that&#39;s out of the question, that wasn&#39;t made? HAVLÍČEK: In no case was it made at all. On the contrary, what was said was that it is right that we are heading towards a zero-emission economy, or rather energy, ad 1 and ad 2, it was clearly said that nuclear is a zero-emission source. The fact that someone has a tendency from time to time, especially from among the critics, to question that, that was said literally and literally by the Director General, (...) that&#39;s what the Director General of the Directorate General Energo, the European Commission, said directly.\nSECTION C: If you look, in Slovakia it cost, I mean Mochovce, three, four, which is approximately 1000 MW of power, it cost 6 billion euros. Yes, someone still claims, but you already had a base there in the order of one to two billion, so let&#39;s admit that it was 7 billion. That means, then it&#39;s around the amount of 100, 150, 160, 180 billion. It depends on the exchange rate used to convert it.\nSECTION D: So we definitively announced that we are really going nuclear, we described what will be discussed, i.e. the fifth unit in Dukovany, and at the same time the so-called official negotiations have begun, which are not yet the exact itinerary of what, where, who will do exactly, but we had to start documenting why we are actually getting started. And the fundamental argument is clear, and I must say that the European Commission highly appreciated it - we are heading towards emission-free energy, that is, we will exchange coal, which today has a share of more than forty percent, for a higher position, i.e. the emergence of higher nuclear and renewable sources, and these are absolutely fundamental messages that to a certain extent actually correspond today with the priorities of the European Union or the European Commission.\nSECTION E: And what is also extremely important, what was said by the European Commission, is that the energy mix is somehow the exclusive competence of individual European Union countries. We will not interfere with how you model it, on the other hand, you must meet certain legislative criteria also vis-à-vis the European Commission in terms of, for example, illegal support and the like. And if you meet all of this, we are ready to notify the process. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

This is only apparent from his answers, which contain expressions such as &quot; <i>generally speaking, I can note for the KSČM...&quot;</i> etc.</p><p> The newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/o-gazete/\">has been published</a> since 2018 with the subtitle Newspaper of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and was previously also the central press organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense. It is therefore possible to describe it as a military newspaper, as Vít Rakušan states. His description of this periodical as a magazine is somewhat more problematic, as the aforementioned subtitle already suggests, Krasnaya Zvezda describes itself as a newspaper. Despite this minor discrepancy, however, we generally assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Vít Rakušan is talking here about the statement of the chairman of the KSČM, Vojtěch Filip, who, in <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/vojteh-filip-bolshinstvo-grazhdan-cheshskoj-respubliki-vot-uzhe-75-let-ispytyvayut-chuvstvo-blagodarnosti-k-krasnoj-armii-2/\">an interview</a> published on May 15, 2020 by the Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, stated:</p><p> <i>“(…) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [is] departing from the national position when it criticizes the Russian Federation for not yet restoring war memorials on its territory to the fallen Czechoslovak legionnaires who fought in Samara, near Lipiag near Novokuybyshev and in other places in Russia with Russian revolutionary communists in 1918.</i></p><p> <i>Members of the KSČM and other citizens of the Czech Republic positively perceive the fact that the Russian government does not show interest in forcing local authorities to build monuments to those Czech legionnaires who did not liberate anyone in Russia and did nothing good for the most brilliant world socialist revolution of the last century in 1917 in Russia.”</i></p><p> The mentioned legionnaires who fought in <a href=\"http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:b5c8164d-afea-4a70-b22a-624680b5fdef?page=uuid:88aa7912-10f7-11e8-b8ac-005056b73ae5\">Samara</a> on the Volga in June 1918 (PLESKÝ, Metoděj. <i>4th Regiment of Prokop the Great</i> . 1936, p. 219) and at the Lipjagi station in the nearby city of Novokuybyshevsk (ibid., pp. 202–203) are soldiers of the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý and <a href=\"http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:dde50707-6b59-4eef-a3d6-916586657465?page=uuid:cefb781e-0fc9-11e8-ad37-005056b73ae5&amp;fulltext=samara\">the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi</a> (LANGER, František. <i>Memorial Book of the 1st Rifle Regiment of Jan Husi.</i> 1920, p. 44). They defeated the Bolshevik troops here, with whom they came into conflict mainly because the Russian side did not comply with the agreement on the departure of the Czechoslovak legionnaires via Vladivostok to France. Tomáš Jakl, a historian at the Military Historical Institute, <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/co-se-odehravalo-behem-velke-valky-na-vychodni-fronte/\">states</a> :</p><p> <i>&quot;However, at the end of April 1918, the transportation of Czechoslovak transports practically stopped due to pressure from Germany. In addition, at the end of May, the Soviet government attempted to completely disarm the Czechoslovak corps and transfer the Czechoslovaks either to the Red Army or to labor units. The Czechoslovak soldiers responded to this attempt by deciding to leave for Vladivostok on their own.&quot;</i></p><p> Before the beginning of the conflicts with the Bolsheviks, these Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia had already achieved a number of military successes in battles with the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. In March 1918, for example, the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý took part in the Battle of <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/exhibit/ruske-legie-v-bitve-u-bachmace-1918/\">Bachmač</a> , where an important railway junction was located. And above all, the soldiers of the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi fought victoriously at <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/zborov-bitva-ktera-cs-vojakum-vydobyla-respekt/\">Zborov</a> in early July 1917.</p><p> Currently, both cities are located in Ukraine, and at the time of the fighting, Bachmač was part of the independent <a href=\"http://www.haidamaka.org.ua/obr/sxslob/mapaunr.jpg\">Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic</a> and Zborov was part of <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Europe_1918.jpg\">the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</a> However, it is important to mention that, for example, Bachmač was still part of <a href=\"https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/map-russian-empire-1914\">the Russian Empire</a> at the beginning of World War I. Let us add that at Zborov, the entire Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade was directly subordinated to the Russian <a href=\"https://kramerius.army.cz/search/i.jsp?pid=uuid:0fee9338-6380-4fab-8551-ecef91c582d5&amp;q=&amp;fq=document_type:%22monograph%22&amp;fq=keywords:%221.%20%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A1%20d%C4%9Blost%C5%99eleck%C3%A1%20brig%C3%A1da%22#monograph-page_uuid:51ea50b3-0fc3-11e8-927a-005056b73ae5\">49th Army Corps</a> (KAVENA, Karel. <i>History of the 1st Artillery Regiment of Jan Žižka of Trocnov in the Russian Revolution and in the Fatherland</i> . 1937, p. 44). It is also an indisputable fact that the 4th and 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiments, with their work (along with many others), helped Russia to achieve final victory on the Eastern European battlefield.</p><p> According to historians, the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian army near the town of Zborov also <a href=\"https://books.google.cz/books?id=li-2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=v%C3%BDznam+zborova+samostatn%C3%A9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkOxi0hmPp&amp;sig=ACfU3U2orK3G_vX83GzgA2tpeU7ffHK1ew&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiv3P358sfpAhXJ8OAKHZvtAqQQ6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A9%20st%C3%A1tn%C3%AD%20samostatnosti&amp;f=false\">played</a> (MOJŽÍŠ, Milan, RAK, Michal et al. <i>Zborov 1917–2017</i> . 2019, p. 150) along with other combat actions of Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia a very <a href=\"http://www.acr.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=11914\">important role</a> in political negotiations on the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak Republic. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Zborov in 2017, for example, the Chamber of Deputies adopted <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=10179\">a resolution</a> that ends with the words: <i>&quot;The deeds of the legionnaires should never be forgotten. The heroes of Zborov have contributed to the state.&quot;</i></p><p> For these reasons, Vojtěch Filip&#39;s statement can to some extent be considered as questioning the historical role of these units, as Vít Rakušan states in the statement. However, it is clear from the statement that Vojtěch Filip directly questioned the role of the legionnaires in the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia. Filip spoke only about their importance for Russia and the revolution in Russia. Rakušan thus presents Filip&#39;s statement in a misleading context.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Vít Rakušan <a href=\"https://www.vitrakusan.cz/zivotopis/\">studied</a> history, German studies, and school management.

Their main <a href=\"https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach\">goal</a> was to defeat Stalin. Germany was to help them achieve these goals. On the side of Nazi Germany, <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">they fought</a> against the USSR in the area between the Oder and the Neisse.</p><p> However, in the spring of 1945, it became <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">clear</a> to Vlasov (audio, time from 15:30) that he could not count on Germany&#39;s help in the long-term fight against Stalin. On the contrary, the Germans were rather using Vlasov&#39;s army for their own purposes. For this reason, he decided to leave Germany with his army for Linz. In an attempt to win the favor of the Allied (or American) troops, he then decided, together with General Bunyachenko, to help liberate Prague.</p><p> <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/zradci-a-vrazi-nebo-zneuznani-osvoboditele-diskuze-o-vyznamu-kontroverznich-8121440\">They arrived</a> in Prague on May 5, 1945.

According to Article 13 (p. 24 of the Agreement) of this Agreement, the right of residence of these citizens will continue to be subject to European law.</p><p> According to Articles 15 and 16 of the Agreement (p. 27 and 28 of the Agreement), European law will apply to these citizens even in the case of obtaining permanent residence. According to Article 20 (p. 40 of the Agreement), European regulations will apply even when restricting the right of residence or entry (which is currently only possible in exceptional circumstances, e.g. for reasons of public security or public health), but only until the end of the so-called transition period (i.e. until 31 December 2020 – Article 126 of the Agreement), after the transition period it will be possible to restrict the right of residence and entry of EU citizens in the United Kingdom on the basis of British law and vice versa.</p><p> In general, there will be no discrimination between EU and UK citizens and EU citizens may become residents in the UK until the end of the transition period (31 December 2020), with their right of movement and residence governed by EU law to the extent set out in the EU <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038&amp;from=CS\">directive</a> , which will also apply to the UK by the end of 2020.</p><p> After the end of the transition period, restrictions on the rights of movement and residence may arise for EU citizens who come to the United Kingdom to obtain resident status, in accordance with Article 20/2 of the Agreement. However, this does not automatically mean that the right of residence and movement of an EU citizen in relation to the United Kingdom will be restricted. This may happen, but it is not certain and depends on the specific legislation of the United Kingdom.</p><p> Much more significant in this statement, however, is the overgeneralization of a complex matter by stating “ <em>they will have the same rights as they would have had if the United Kingdom were in the European Union</em> .” The aforementioned Article 20 of the Agreement regulates only the freedom of movement and residence, not all rights.</p><p> EU citizens who are also residents of the United Kingdom will thus be guaranteed the freedom of movement and residence under EU directives as they have been until now. However, Article 20 of the Agreement does not mention other rights granted by European Union legislation. At the same time, it is highly unlikely that the United Kingdom would maintain all the provisions governing the rights of EU citizens when it is no longer a member of the European Union.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>The issue of immigration was used by Brexit supporters during the referendum as one of the arguments for the UK leaving the EU, as shown in their summary articles by, for example, the online <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/22/11992106/brexit-arguments\">VOX</a> and the daily newspaper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/brexit-camp-immigration-economic-vote-leave\">The Guardian</a> . The extreme abuse of the immigration topic to gain support is also shown by the well-known <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\">photo</a> of UKIP party leader Nigel Farage from June 16, 2016. </p><img src=\"https://media.pri.org/s3fs-public/styles/story_main/public/story/images/RTX2I01M%202016-6-27.jpg?itok=Rt_d6D6C\" alt=\"\"/><p> The more moderate Vote Leave movement, led by MP Boris Johnson, which represented the main voice of supporters of leaving the EU at the time of the referendum, expressed its views on migration more cautiously. On its <a href=\"http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/briefing_immigration.html\">website</a> , it did not specifically mention any areas or centers of immigration, but generally emphasized the need to gain control over the borders and independence from interference in British migration policy, for example, by European courts.</p><p> Immigration was also the main reason <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-britain-is-in-denial-over-immigration/\">cited</a> among people who voted to leave, according to surveys.</p><p> Immigration to the UK around the Brexit <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum\">vote</a> (24 June 2016) showed several trends. As <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/163686248\">data</a> from Oxford University shows, migration from the EU increased after the EU enlargement in 2003, fell during the economic recession in 2007–2009, and has been gradually increasing again since then. Nevertheless, the main share of migration to the UK is accounted for by citizens from non-EU countries. The main EU source countries, which have long accounted for the majority of immigration to the EU, are Poland, Ireland and Germany. In the post-crisis period, there has been a noticeable increase from the new countries (Romania, Hungary), but also especially from the so-called southern wing of the EU (Italy, Spain and Portugal).</p><p> It is not true that Central and Eastern Europe itself is the source of the main wave of immigration. Similar results are shown by <a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit05.pdf\">research</a> on data from 2015 by the London School of Economics and Political Science. The representation of EU citizens among immigrants (pp. 2–3) is shown in the following graph, which clearly shows the dominance of Poles as workers from the EU: </p><p></p><img src=\"https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBa0VJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--05b468ae81bbc5ab981b6e319758df0977cd9e72/migrace%20do%20vb.PNG\" alt=\"\"/><p> Source: <a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit05.pdf\">Brexit and the Impact of Immigration on the UK</a> (.pdf), LSE, p. 3</p><p> The question of whether European workers are taking jobs away from British workers is part of a larger debate within economics, and therefore we do not examine it more extensively. We only note that in the same research the authors also address the question of whether immigration from the EU is taking jobs away from UK citizens or reducing real wages. In both cases, they conclude that immigration from the EU has only a minimal impact on the topics in question, for example, it shows that until 2011 real wages increased with the number of arrivals (ibid., p. 7). The position of foreign vs. British workers was also <a href=\"http://appgmigration.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/APPG-on-Migration-Brexit_Beyond-the-highly-skilled-report-Sept-2017.pdf\">expressed</a> in its document by the parliamentary group on migration, in which all political parties were represented. The group collected information from important interest groups (stakeholders). It states (pp. 5–6) that in some sectors (in less qualified positions) there is a high dependence on European workers, who are more willing to work non-standard working hours and move for work, while British workers are not interested in these positions. He expresses concerns about changes that may reduce the flexibility of British businesses.</p><p> As for the criticism of the current form of the Agreement from the supporters of a hard Brexit, it is aimed at several aspects of the Agreement. Former Brexit Secretary Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/09/09/boris-johnson-compares-latest-brexit-deal-suicide-vest-drawing-sharp-criticism/?utm_term=.d9cfe0ab4ef6\">criticizes</a> that May has given in too much to the EU&#39;s demands and is turning the UK into a &quot;vassal state&quot;: too many EU regulations will be maintained and the UK will pay too much in compensation. Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/08/brexit-deal-nigel-farage-says-deal-not-acceptable-business-leaders/\">criticized</a> that the European Court of Justice will continue to rule on the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, which he considers humiliating and unacceptable.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>The goal of promoting people with professional experience to the Prague City Council was stated by Jiří Pospíšil at <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2645339-zadni-funkcionari-ale-experti-predstavila-budouci-prazska-koalice-sve-radni\">a briefing</a> for the leaders of the Prague coalition on November 7, 2018 (second video, time 4:15).</p><p> &quot; <em>As colleagues have already indicated, we have primarily appointed politicians to the City Council who understand the issues in question. Who not only have some party function in quotation marks, and thus deserve to be on the City Council, but at least for us, and this is also the case for colleagues, we appoint experts to the City Council who understand the professional responsibilities they will be in charge of, and will therefore manage and carry them out better than, for example, Mr. Dolínek (...).</em> &quot;</p><p> Immediately after the election results were announced, representatives of the Pirates and the Prague for Itself movement, out of the three potential coalition partners, claimed the mayoral seat. The representative of the United Forces for Prague, Jiří Pospíšil, stated for <a href=\"https://praha.idnes.cz/komunalni-volby-2018-praha-vyjednavani-prazsky-magistrat-koalice-pirati-praha-sobe-ods-primator-ciz-iod-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=A181008_431494_praha-zpravy_rsr\">the iDnes.cz</a> server on October 8, 2018: &quot; <em>For us, the program is key, the function of mayor is secondary and we are not considering it.</em> &quot;<br/><br/> The Pirates justified their claim to the mayoral seat by the largest percentage gain of valid <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xdz=4&amp;xnumnuts=1100&amp;xobec=554782&amp;xstat=0&amp;xvyber=0\">electoral votes</a> from a potential three-way coalition. The Pirates received 17.07%, Prague For Its Own 16.57% and United Forces for Prague 16.29%. The Prague For Its Own Movement, on the other hand, argued that its leader Jan Čižinský received the highest number <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv21111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=23&amp;xdz=4&amp;xnumnuts=1100&amp;xobec=554782&amp;xstrana=0&amp;xstat=0&amp;xodkaz=1\">of preferential votes</a> of all elected representatives of the capital city of Prague, specifically 80,552.</p><p> Jan Čižinský later stated, according to <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2633327-pospisil-chce-hlavne-koalici-na-postu-prazskeho-primatora-netrva\">the ČT 24</a> server, that he no longer wanted to remain mayor: &quot; <em>We are giving up the ambition to have a mayor and, within that, to create a coalition that will be stable for four years.</em> &quot;<em> </em></p><p>Jiří Pospíšil then expressed himself in a similar vein. At a briefing on October 25, 2018, he stated that he was ready to take on the position of mayor. At the same time, he also emphasized that he did not insist on the position of mayor. Pospíšil <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2633327-pospisil-chce-hlavne-koalici-na-postu-prazskeho-primatora-netrva\">expressed himself</a> (time 2:25) in such a way that he did not want to endanger the emerging coalition, in which the Pirates insist on the position of mayor, by clinging to the position of mayor: “ <em>The negotiations clearly show that either the Pirates will win the position of mayor, or there will be no coalition. (...) A possible deadlock threatening the formation of a coalition would disappoint a number of Prague residents who want change at Prague City Hall. (...) After long negotiations and long decision-making with our representatives and within our coalition so that it could be established and bring a new political style and a new political culture to the municipality, we decided that we will not insist on the position of mayor.</em> ”</p><p> The leader of the Prague Pirates, Zdeněk Hřib, eventually became <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2649077-hribova-era-zacina-prazska-koalice-podepise-smlouvu\">the mayor of</a> Prague.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>Crimea was <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-61891160-krym-a-sevastopol-oficialne-patri-k-rusku-putin-podepsal-smlouvu-o-pripojeni\">annexed</a> by Russia on 21 March 2014. The annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia was preceded by a referendum announced by the Crimean parliament, which was held on 16 March 2014. The referendum <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1043406-krym-o-referendum-byl-velky-zajem\">asked</a> the following two questions:</p><p> &quot; <em>Are you in favor of the reunification of Crimea with Russia with the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation?</em> &quot;</p><p> &quot; <em>Are you in favor of restoring the 1992 constitution and the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine?</em> &quot;</p><p> However, as has been pointed out (e.g. <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-61857960-zive-pro-pripojeni-krymu-k-rusku-je-pres-95-procent-lidi-eu-rozhodne-o-sankcich\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/world/europe/crimea-vote-does-not-offer-choice-of-status-quo.html\">here</a> ), the difference on these issues is minimal. The 1992 constitution, adopted at the time of the collapse of the USSR, granted Crimea extensive autonomy. Crimea was annexed to Ukraine in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev and had previously belonged to Russia for 170 years.</p><p> Shortly after Russia&#39;s annexation of Crimea, pro-Russian militants in eastern Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/donbas-obse-ukrajina-prorusti-povstalci_1808031711_dbr\">occupied</a> the Donbas and Luhansk regions and declared two people&#39;s republics. According to Ukraine, Moscow is the military backer of the separatists. Moscow has long <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/donbas-armada/r~94f2eca2880411e7aec7002590604f2e/\">denied</a> sending Russian troops to the Donbas. However, in 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/vladimir-putin-admits-russian-military-presence-ukraine\">told</a> a press conference: &quot; <em>We never said that there were no people there who performed certain tasks in the military sphere</em> .&quot;<em> </em>However, according to him, this is not the same as sending Russian troops.</p><p> In February 2017, the UN issued <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21730&amp;LangID=E\">a report</a> according to which the conflict in Donbass had already claimed 10,090 victims, of which 2,777 were civilians. In 2014, the first Minsk Agreement was <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/EPRS/EPRS-Briefing-548991-Minsk-peace-summit-FINAL.pdf\">negotiated</a> (.pdf, p. 2) between Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, but it was soon violated by pro-Russian separatists who seized territory in eastern Ukraine. In February 2015, the second Minsk Agreement was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1502444-uspesny-minsk-dohoda-na-primeri-i-demarkacni-linii\">reached</a> in Belarus, which agreed on a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, an amnesty for all participants in the fighting, and also, for example, a constitutional reform allowing for the decentralization of rebel areas by the end of the year. According to the UN, both agreements are still <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/osn-donbas-civilisti-ukrajina-minska-dohoda-poruseni_1806210808_gol\">being violated</a> by both sides.</p><p> The Council of the EU condemned the annexation of Crimea. On 17 March 2014, <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/meetings/fac/2014/03/17/\">it adopted</a> &quot; <em>restrictive measures against 21 individuals and persons and entities associated with them in connection with their involvement in activities that threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.</em> &quot;<em> </em>The foreign ministers also condemned the Crimean referendum at this Council and did not recognise its result. The Council considered the referendum held to be illegal and in clear violation of the Ukrainian constitution. Since March 2014, the EU has adopted a series <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/\">of restrictive measures</a> against Russia in response to the Ukrainian crisis. Most recently, in September 2018, <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/history-ukraine-crisis/\">it extended</a> the sanctions imposed in connection with the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p><p> The annexation of Crimea is contrary to international law, as stated in <a href=\"http://www.osn.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/charta-organizace-spojenych-narodu-a-statut-mezinarodniho-soudniho-dvora.pdf\">the UN Charter</a> (.pdf, p. 5) in Article 2, paragraph 4:</p><p> <em>4.</em> &quot; <em>All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.</em> &quot;<em><br/></em><br/> As Christian Marxsen of the Planck Institute also <a href=\"http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf4/Marxsen_2014_-_The_crimea_crisis_-_an_international_law_perspective.pdf\">summarizes</a> (.pdf), Russian arguments about protecting the Russian-speaking population abroad or intervention based on invitation will not stand up under international law.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>Although the approval of the electoral coalition between STAN and KDU-ČSL for the 2017 elections was not always supported by an overwhelming majority of the membership, its participation, albeit somewhat limited, in the approval process of their coalition cooperation cannot be denied. The coalition project was not formed only at the level of the party leadership, as Pospíšil states.</p><p> One of the first reports of possible cooperation between the KDU-ČSL and STAN appeared in December 2016, when the KDU-ČSL National Conference <a href=\"https://kdu.cz/aktualne/archiv/2016/kdu-csl-jsme-pripraveni-jednat-o-spolupraci-se-sta\">authorized</a> the party&#39;s presidium to begin negotiations for cooperation in the upcoming elections to the Chamber of Deputies in 2017.</p><p> Initially, there was the possibility of a so-called integration party, in which a new entity would be created, whose candidate lists would consist of members of two cooperating parties. However, this project was <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/info-a-media/tiskove-zpravy/o-koalici-s-kdu-csl-rozhodneme-brzy\">rejected by</a> the KDU-ČSL National Conference, and instead <a href=\"https://kdu.cz/aktualne/archiv/2017/kdu-csl-celostatni-konference-podporuje-dlouhodobo\">the conference authorized</a> the presidium to negotiate cooperation between the parties at the level of an electoral coalition.</p><p> The offer of coalition cooperation for the 2017 elections was accepted by the Mayor when a similar mandate for the leadership of STAN was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2032940-starostove-chteji-jit-do-voleb-v-koalici-s-lidovci-museli-ziskat-pres-10-procent\">approved by</a> 81% of the delegates <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/nasi-lide/celostatni-vybor-stan\">of the STAN National Committee.</a></p><p> The electoral coalition was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2060128-lidovci-souhlasi-se-spolecnou-koalici-se-starosty-pujdou-do-voleb\">approved</a> by the KDU-ČSL National Conference on 18 March 2017 with 39 delegates in favour and 31 against.
