Musculoskeletal system

Before moving on to the study of the human musculoskeletal system, remember what structure the musculoskeletal system of various animals has. How can the features of the vital activity of animals affect the structure of their musculoskeletal system?


The main elements of the musculoskeletal systemThe human musculoskeletal system consists of the skeleton and muscles. The basis of the human skeleton is cartilage and bone tissue, and muscles are formed by muscle tissue. Cartilage tissue is built from chondroblast cells immersed in an elastic intercellular substance - chondrin. This substance contains fibers consisting of collagen protein. Bone tissue is formed from osteoblast cells immersed in a calcified intercellular substance, 30% of which consists of organic compounds, mainly collagen fibers, and 70% - inorganic substances. Muscle tissue consists of muscle cells, which in striated muscle tissue merge with each other.


Why is the musculoskeletal system needed? The main functions of the musculoskeletal system are protective, supporting
and motor. The protective function is performed by individual parts of the skeleton, for
example, the skull protects the brain from mechanical damage, the ribs - the heart and lungs, etc. Muscles also protect internal organs, especially in places where there are no skeletal bones. The skeleton is a rigid support that serves as a frame for the body, helps it maintain a certain shape and facilitates movement. Internal organs and, of course, muscles are also attached to the skeleton.


96. Musculoskeletal system


The motor function of the musculoskeletal system is performed as a result of the interaction of skeletal elements and muscles. During muscle contraction, parts of the skeleton work as levers, which allows a person to make various movements.


Consequences of upright walking Many features of the structure of the human musculoskeletal system are a consequence of its adaptation to upright walking. Thus, the occipital foramen, through which the spinal cord passes to connect with the head, is located in humans at the bottom of the skull, although in other mammals it is located at the back. This feature is due to the location of the spine. In the process of evolution, the human spine itself has also changed: it has ceased to be straight and now has four curves - two forward and two backward. This shape of the spine allows it to spring while walking and facilitates movement. Walking upright has significantly affected the pelvis and lower limbs. The human pelvis has a cup-shaped shape and is wider, but shorter, than that of monkeys (which complicates the process of childbirth). The bones of the feet form an arch, which makes a person's gait elastic and softens the shocks during running and jumping.


The transition to walking upright began in human ancestors approximately 7 million years
ago. It was then that the oldest representative of the Human family, Sahelianthropus, lived in Africa
. In him, the occipital foramen began to shift to the lower part of the skull for the first time.


The musculoskeletal system of the human body includes the skeleton and muscles. They perform supporting, protective and motor functions. The structure of the musculoskeletal system includes many adaptations for upright walking that have been formed over millions of years of human evolution..Topic 6


Bones and Cartilage

Before proceeding to the study of human bones and cartilage, remember what types of tissues are in the human body. To what type of tissue do bones and cartilage belong? How does this type of tissue differ from others?

Fig. 26.1. Structure of a tubular bone


Features of the structure of bones According to the features of their structure, bones are divided into several groups: tubular, short, flat and mixed. The middle part of tubular (or long) bones (Fig. 26.1) is called the diaphysis and contains a cavity in which yellow bone marrow is located, represented mainly by fatty tissue. The walls of this part of the bone are formed by a very dense compact substance. The ends of the tubular bones - the epiphyses - do not contain cavities and are formed by spongy substance. This substance has a loose structure with a large number of small cavities in which red bone marrow cells are located, which contains stem cells - precursors of blood cells and lymphocytes. Tubular bones are the humerus, radius, femur, tibia. Short bones consist mainly of spongy substance and contain red bone marrow. These include the bones of the wrist, metatarsal, and foot. Flat bones, like short bones, are formed by spongy substance and, accordingly, also contain red bone marrow, but they are larger in size and have a flat shape. These are the bones of the skull, shoulder blades,
sternum, ribs, and pelvic bones.
Certain bones, such as vertebrae and some bones of the skull, have features of both short and flat bones, therefore they are called mixed. Such bones are the lower jaw, temporal bones, etc. The growth of bones in thickness is provided by the periosteum, which covers the bone from above.


98. Bones and cartilage


Bone joints Bone joints can have varying degrees of mobility. Movable bone joints are called joints, and immovable ones are called sutures. For more information on the features of different types of bone joints, see the table.


Types of bone joints


Type of joint Characteristics Examples


Between the bones of the skull


Fixed joint (suture) Formed by a thin layer of connective tissue between the bones. Provides a strong connection of the bones and protection of the organs


Joints between the
vertebrae


Semi-mobile joint The bones in the joint are separated from each other by cartilage pads. Provides limited mobility


Movable joint The surfaces of the bones in the joint are covered with cartilage and separated by a cavity with joint fluid


Elbow and knee joints, shoulder and hip joints


To ensure effective movements, the joints have a rather complex structure. The joint is limited by the joint bag, which separates its contents from other structures of the body. It contains a cavity filled with fluid, which ensures ease of movement of the bones relative to each other. In addition, the surfaces of the bones are covered with smooth cartilage, which also reduces friction. To prevent damage to the cartilage, the ligaments of the joint limit the movements of the bones. According to the possible directions of movement of the bones relative to each other, three types of joints are distinguished: uniaxial, which perform movements in one direction (interphalangeal joints of the fingers); biaxial, which perform movements in two directions (radiocarpal joint); triaxial, which carry out movements in three directions (hip
joint).


CartilageCartilage plays an important role in the joints of bones and forms the basis of some organs and structures of the body. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, fibrous and elastic. Hyaline cartilage forms the articular surfaces at the joints of bones. It also ensures the growth of bones in length. Fibrous cartilage

Departments of the skeleton
The human skeleton is divided into several large departments. The bones of each department have their own structural features related to the functions they perform. Detailed information on the departments of the skeleton is given in the table.

Ensuring mobility of the lower limbs


Skeleton of the lower limbs (Fig. 26.4)


Consists of the pelvic girdle (pelvic bones) and free lower limbs (thigh, lower leg, foot)


Approximately 20% of the mass of our The body is made up of a skeleton. Only primates, including humans, have three bones on each finger, except for the thumb. In the cervical spine of humans, as in almost all mammals, there are seven vertebrae. The first of them is called the atlas. It provides a connection between the spine and the skull. The second cervical vertebra - the epistropheus - has a special outgrowth, which is the axis around which the skull rotates.


The human skeleton consists of bones and cartilage. Bones can be tubular (long), short, flat or mixed. Bones can be connected movably and immovably. Movable joints of bones are called joints. The skeleton is divided into sections, such as the skeleton of the head, torso, upper and lower limbs. TOPIC 6


Muscles


27


Before moving on to the study of human muscles, remember what types of tissues are in the human body. What type of tissue are muscles made of? How does this type of tissue differ from others? What functions does it perform?


Muscle groups in the body
Muscles in the human body can be included not only in the
musculoskeletal system, but also in internal organs, such as the stomach, intestines, uterus. The muscles of the musculoskeletal system can be divided into several groups, which differ in their structural features and functions. Most of them are skeletal: they attach to the bones with their ends and ensure their movement. Get acquainted with the types of muscles by studying the table and Fig. 27.2.


Features of the structure and function of muscles of different groups


Muscle group Structural features Functions


Provide the process of chewing and facial expressions


Muscles of the head Represented by facial and chewing muscles. Facial muscles are attached to the skin of the face, so during their contraction, separate areas of the skin move


Muscles of the trunk Consist of the muscles of the chest, abdomen and back. They also include the diaphragm.


They ensure the processes of
breathing, movement of the trunk and limbs.
Hold internal organs, preventing them from sagging and falling out


Provide mobility of the upper limbs


Muscles of the upper limbs These include the deltoid muscle, biceps and triceps muscles, as well as the muscles of the forearm and hand


Provide mobility of the lower limbs


Muscles of the lower limbs These include the sartorius muscle, quadriceps, biceps, calf muscle and muscles of the foot

Features of the muscles of the headThe masticatory muscles of the head attach to the lower jaw and provide its movements relative to the upper jaw. Moving the lower jaw back and forth and to both sides allows a person to chew food, which is then ground by the teeth. Mimic muscles are usually attached at one end to the bones of the skull, and at the other to a certain area of the skin. This allows a person to move areas of the skin relative to each other. The exceptions are the orbicularis oculi and the laugher muscle, which are not attached to bones. Mimic muscles provide the expression of emotions by a person.

Fig. 27.3. Types of muscles


Types of muscles Muscles are divided into different groups according to their shape, size, or function (Fig. 27.3). In addition, they can attach to bones or other organs in several places (have several heads). Most muscles have one abdomen and two heads. According to their shape, muscles are divided into the following types: spindle-shaped (biceps); square (quadrate muscle of the thigh);
triangular (deltoid muscle);
ribbon-shaped (rectus abdominis); circular (orbital muscle of the mouth). Circular muscles, or sphincters, surround openings in the human body and are responsible for opening and closing them. An example of such muscles is the circular muscle of the mouth. According to size, muscles are distinguished as long, short, and broad. Long muscles are the muscles of the limbs - biceps, triceps, quadriceps, sartorius, and calf muscles. Short muscles are located where the distance between the bones is small. For example, these include the intercostal muscles. Broad muscles, such as, say, the latissimus dorsi, are located on the trunk. According to the functions performed, muscles are divided into the following types: flexors - bend part of the body (biceps); extensors - extend part of the body (triceps); abductors - move the limb away from the body (gluteus medius muscle);


104. Adductor muscles


— bring the limb to the body (adductor major muscle); rotator muscles — ensure rotation of the limb around its axis (tailor muscle).


Achilles tendon


Fig. 27.4. Tendons of


attachment of muscles to bonesMuscles are attached to bones by means of tendons (Fig. 27.4). The tendon is formed by dense
tissue and is the terminal part of striated
muscles. Its basis is collagen protein fibers, intertwined with each other, which gives them extraordinary strength. In addition, the tendon contains blood vessels that provide its cells with nutrients and oxygen. The shape of the tendon can be different. In large muscles, it usually has a cylindrical shape. Other muscles may have flat, rounded, ribbon-like or plate-like tendons. In case of excessive strain, tendons can be damaged.


The body of an adult consists of 639 muscles. This is approximately 6 billion muscle cells.


Human muscles are divided into long, short, broad and circular (sphincters). Skeletal muscles are attached to the bones with their ends and provide their movements. Depending on their location on the body, muscles of the head, trunk, upper and lower extremities are distinguished..TOPIC 6


How muscles work


28


Before proceeding to study the work of human muscles, remember what features are inherent in muscle tissue. How does muscle tissue differ from epithelial tissue? What types of muscles are there? Where are these types of muscles located in the human body?


Mechanism of muscle contraction
Muscle cells contain microscopic filaments consisting of actin and myosin proteins. They are located parallel to each other. As a result of the action of the nervous system signal, the protein filaments move away from each other, and the total length of the muscle fiber decreases. As a result, the length of the entire muscle becomes smaller - the muscle contracts. After the signals from the nervous system stop, the protein filaments return to their places, while the length of the muscle increases and it relaxes. An important role in the processes of contraction and relaxation is played by calcium ions, which are a signal for the muscle to start working.


Physical properties of musclesMuscles, like any system that performs some work, have certain characteristics by which this work can be evaluated. Such characteristics are the physical properties of muscles. Using these properties, you can compare the efficiency of the work of different muscles. You can familiarize yourself with them in the table. Physical properties of muscles


Physical propertyCharacteristics of properties


Muscle strengthThe magnitude of the maximum tension that a muscle can develop. It depends on the mass of the muscle, the number of simultaneously excited fibers, the frequency of nerve impulses entering the muscle. Muscle contraction speed A characteristic determined by the time during which the muscle contracts and relaxes. Depending on the contraction speed, slow and fast muscles are distinguished.


Muscle endurance
The ability of the muscle to maintain a given rhythm of work for a long time
Muscle tone A state of constant slight tension of the muscle. It provides support for posture and fixation of internal organs. It is determined by the natural properties of the muscle and the influence of the nervous system


106. How muscles work


Static work


movement


Dynamic work


Fig. 28.1. Muscle work


Muscle work There are two main types of muscle work - static and dynamic (Fig. 28.1). During static work, the muscles tense but do not contract. When a person holds a load in an outstretched arm, static work is performed. During dynamic work, muscles alternately contract and stretch. A person lifts and lowers a load - this is an example of dynamic work. Performing prolonged or intensive work leads to muscle fatigue. During static work, it is not the muscles themselves that get tired, but the nerve centers, the cells of which can no longer produce new signals for the muscles. During dynamic work, muscle fatigue occurs due to a lack of oxygen, a decrease in energy production and the
accumulation of decay products.
After the work that caused fatigue is over, in the period after recovery, the muscle's working capacity increases (the phenomenon of over-recovery). This phenomenon is the basis of training processes. If you constantly load the muscles, they will work better. However, you should know that under too high loads, over-recovery does not occur.


The efficiency of the work of an individual muscle cell is quite high - approximately 50%. But the efficiency of the muscle as a whole is lower - about 20%. These results are quite close to the efficiency of internal combustion engines. Modern gasoline engines have an efficiency of 25–30%, and diesel engines have an efficiency of 40–50%. The efficiency of human muscles decreases in cold conditions. This allows the body to release more energy in the form of heat and maintain the required body temperature.


Protein structures built from actin and myosin proteins take an active part in the process of muscle work. The physical qualities of muscles are their strength, speed of contraction, endurance and tone. The work performed by muscles can be static or dynamic. TOPIC 6


How the musculoskeletal system develops


29


Before proceeding to study the features of the development of the human musculoskeletal system, remember which organs are part of it. What functions do they perform? How do muscles work? How do bones connect to each other?


Bone growth
Bone growth and ossification occur in childhood and adolescence. The greatest increase in length is observed in the first two years of life. The following periods of intensive growth are 7–8 years and during puberty. Bone growth in length stops at 22–24 years. Bones grow in length due to the division of cartilage cells that cover their ends, and in thickness - due to the activity of periosteum cells (Fig. 29.1). After the end of growth, cell division in the bones does not stop. The processes of destruction of old bone substance and its replacement with new one continue throughout life. It is thanks to them that the fusion and restoration of bones after fractures is possible. In addition, these processes are necessary for the adaptation of bones to loads, under the influence of which the internal structure of the bone is rebuilt. That is why the bones of a person who leads a sedentary lifestyle differ from the bones of an athlete.


Fig. 29.1. Bone growth


Muscle growth Muscle growth in humans occurs more or less evenly, except for the period of 14–16 years, when the growth intensity is greatest. Because of this, the movements of adolescents seem uncertain and clumsy. This is because the nervous system does not have time to adjust to the new proportions of body parts that change


108. How the musculoskeletal system develops


too quickly for it. After some time, the brain adapts to the new situation, and these minor problems disappear. Muscle growth occurs not only in childhood or adolescence. Appropriate loads can stimulate muscle development and increase their size in other periods of life.


Hypodynamia and its consequences Normal development of the musculoskeletal system is possible only with sufficient motor activity, good nutrition, and stable activity of the endocrine glands. Insufficient motor activity is one of the most common problems of our time. This disease is called hypodynamia. It leads to a number of negative consequences that affect not only the musculoskeletal system, but also other human organ systems. The consequences of hypodynamia: dystrophy (reduction, weakening) of skeletal muscles; weakening of the force of heart contractions and vascular tone; reduction in the intensity of metabolism and energy; circulatory disorders and atherosclerosis; deterioration of digestion and absorption of food; weakening of immunity; emotional instability.


Bones grow in length due to the division of cartilage cells at their ends, growth in thickness is provided by periosteum cells. Bone growth processes stop at 22–24 years of age, but throughout a person's life, processes of replacing old bone substance with new occur. Muscle growth continues not only in childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood. Insufficient physical activity leads to significant problems with human health..TOPIC 6


Diseases of
the musculoskeletal system

Before moving on to the study of disorders in the human musculoskeletal system, remember what organs are part of it. What functions does it perform? What diseases of the musculoskeletal system do you know? Musculoskeletal


system disorders due to mechanical damage


You have already studied the functions of the musculoskeletal system and know that they provide human movement and also protect internal organs from damage. Therefore, it is not surprising that a significant part of the disorders in the work of these organs occurs as a result of their mechanical damage. For more details, see the information in the table.

However, disorders in the functioning of the musculoskeletal system can occur not only as a result of mechanical injuries. Like other organ systems, the musculoskeletal system can be affected by infectious agents and parasites. Often, infections penetrate the muscles or bones through wounds. If the damage cannot be reliably disinfected, then pathogenic organisms begin to develop in the wound. This is very dangerous and can even lead to gangrene. In addition, the infection can also enter the bones through the bloodstream, such as the causative agents of syphilis or tuberculosis. Similarly, parasitic worms enter the muscles through the bloodstream, forming fins or capsules in them and causing disturbances in their work. The state of the musculoskeletal system is also affected by metabolic processes. For example, a lack of minerals increases the risk of fractures, and a lack of vitamin D in food causes the development of rickets and bone curvature.


Diseases of the musculoskeletal system can be caused by metabolic disorders, infections or mechanical injuries. The most common mechanical injuries to the musculoskeletal system are muscle and ligament sprains, bruises and fractures. It is necessary to know the rules for providing first aid in cases of different types of injuries in order not to cause even greater harm to the victim.
