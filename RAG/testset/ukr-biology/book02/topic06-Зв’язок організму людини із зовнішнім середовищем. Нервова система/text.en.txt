Before moving on to the study of human neurons, remember what types of tissues are in the human body. What type of tissue are neurons composed of? How does this type of tissue differ from others? What functions does this tissue perform?

Structure of a neuronThe basis of the nervous system is made up of neurons - cells of nervous tissue. They are excitable cells that are able to process information and transmit it further in the form of an electrical or chemical signal. Neurons send chemical signals to neighboring cells over
very short distances, but they can spread electrical
signals very far. The entire structure of a neuron is adapted for receiving and transmitting signals. It consists of a cell body, in which its nucleus is located, and two types of processes - axons and dendrites (Fig. 31.1). An axon is a long and very thin process. A cell can have only one of them. The length of an axon in human neurons can reach 1 m. For faster signal transmission, many axons have a sheath made of myelin, which consists of 70% of fats and 30% of proteins.


114. Neurons


This sheath is not continuous - it is periodically interrupted. Myelin is a good insulator, so the signal that travels along an axon with a myelin coating does not spread gradually, but immediately jumps over the areas covered with it. As a result, the speed of signal transmission increases by 5â€“10 times. Dendrites are short processes that connect neurons with cells located nearby. Both dendrites and axons can branch at the ends. To transmit signals, neurons use special structures of their membrane - synapses.


Neurotransmitter molecules Presynaptic membrane


Postsynaptic
membrane membrane


Synaptic gap


synapse Synapses are located mainly at the tips of dendrites and axons, but a certain number of them are also on the body of the neuron. A synapse is a place where a signal is transmitted from one cell to another. Thus, a synapse includes parts of two different cells. The cell that sends the signal forms a special presynaptic (i.e., located before the synapse) membrane, and the cell that receives the signal forms a postsynaptic (located after the synapse). Between these membranes is the synaptic cleft (Fig. 31.2). In the human body, there are two main types of synapses: chemical and electrical. In chemical synapses, the synaptic cleft is relatively wide, while in electrical synapses, on the contrary, it is narrow. In electrical synapses, the signal is transmitted from cell to cell very quickly, almost without delay. In chemical synapses, however, the process is much slower. During signal transmission in these synapses, the membrane surface secretes special substances - neurotransmitters, which penetrate through the gap and transmit the signal to the receptors of the postsynaptic membrane. As already mentioned, the process of signal transmission in such synapses is much slower, but there are the most chemical synapses in humans. This is explained by the fact that this method allows for very fine regulation of signal transmission. A cell that has a chemical synapse can receive several signals from neighboring cells. Some of them can stimulate the release of a neurotransmitter, others can inhibit it, and still others can stimulate the release of enzymes that destroy the neurotransmitter.

Fig. 31.3. Neurons with different numbers of processes


of division of enzymes that destroy the neurotransmitter. Whether the signal will pass further depends on the ratio of different signals. This ability to regulate is very important even in simple situations. For example, when a person is about to cross the street, the neuron that sends a signal to the leg muscles must receive information from other neurons. The visual cortex recognizes the color of the traffic light (you can't go through red), the auditory cortex notifies you of car signals and people's voices, and memory suggests the best route to cross. The combined effect of these signals leads to the neuron giving (or not giving) a nerve impulse to start moving.


Types of neurons Neurons are divided into three large groups. Sensitive (sensory) neurons perceive excitation and transmit it from receptors to other neurons. Motor (motor and secretory) neurons transmit information to executive organs (muscles or glands). Interneurons connect one neuron to another. Neurons are also distinguished by the number of processes (Fig. 31.3). They can have one, two or many processes. Most human neurons
have many processes. They are called
multipolar neurons.

Reflex arc To conduct signals from the receptor to the working organ, different types of neurons are combined into a special structure - a reflex arc (Fig. 31.4). It begins with a sensitive neuron, which transmits a signal from the receptor. For example, a skin heat receptor has perceived an increase in temperature from the fire of a candle. The sensitive neuron does not

Neurons


The neuron, using its axon, transmits a signal from this receptor to the spinal cord. There, the signal enters the dendrite of the next neuron - the motor neuron. And through the body of this neuron, along the axon, it reaches the muscle of the hand, which perceives the signal and contracts. As a result, the hand jerks away from the fire. In addition to these two neurons, the reflex arc can also include an intervening neuron. Then the signal from the sensory neuron is transmitted to the motor neuron not directly, but indirectly.


One neuron can be connected to a huge number - up to 20 thousand - of other neurons. Myelin gives the axon fibers a white color, so the parts of the human brain that consist mainly of axons and perform conductive functions are called white matter. In 1992, the so-called mirror neurons were discovered. These are neurons that are excited not only when a person (or animal) performs an action, but also when he simply observes the performance of this action by another creature. It is believed that they are responsible for imitation. Such neurons have been discovered in humans, monkeys and some birds.


Neurons are cells of nervous tissue that are capable of perceiving, processing and transmitting information. They have long (axons) and short (dendrites) processes. Signals from one cell to another are transmitted through special structures of their membranes - synapses. There are two main types of synapses in the human body - chemical and electrical. To transmit signals from receptors to working organs, neurons form reflex arcs - structures consisting of sensory, motor and interneurons..TOPIC 7


Nervous System


32


Before moving on to the study of the human nervous system, remember what the structure of the nervous system of different animals is. How can the characteristics of the vital activity of animals affect the structure of their nervous system?


Features of the structure of the nervous system


Central nervous system


Peripheral Peripheral Peripheral


Peripheral nervous system


Like all other vertebrates, the human nervous system is of the tubular type. This means that during the development of a human embryo, its nervous system initially has the form of a tube
. Then this tube increases, its
anterior part expands significantly and forms the brain. The posterior part forms the spinal cord. Together, the spinal cord and the brain constitute the central nervous system. All other nerves that depart from the brain and spinal cord form the peripheral nervous system (Fig. 32.1).


Fig. 32.1. Diagram of the structure of the human nervous system


Central nervous system As already noted, the spinal cord and the brain form the central nervous system, which plays a major role in controlling the body. In its upper part, the spinal cord smoothly passes into the brain. Both are covered with special meninges that ensure their vital activity. Inside the spinal cord passes a canal filled with cerebrospinal fluid. It continues


118. The nervous system


and in the brain, where it forms several extensions - the ventricles of the brain.


peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system unites all the nerves and nerve nodes
located outside the central nervous system. It is formed by 12 pairs of cranial nerves (coming from the brain) and 31 pairs of spinal nerves (coming from the spinal cord). All these nerves branch out and control the work of various organs. The nerves of the peripheral system are mainly axons and do not contain the bodies of neurons, which are mostly concentrated in the central nervous system. However, in certain places the bodies of neurons are located outside its boundaries. Such clusters are called nerve nodes, or ganglia. Usually, nerve nodes are covered with a connective tissue membrane and are located either directly on the nerves, or near the internal organ, or in its wall. The peripheral nervous system is functionally divided into two large parts - the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system controls the work of skeletal muscles and ensures human movements (works voluntarily), in addition, it is responsible for collecting and transmitting information from the sensory organs. The autonomic, or autonomic, nervous system controls the involuntary work of smooth muscles of internal organs, as well as the heart and glands.


The abdominal, or solar, plexus is located in humans in the upper part of the abdominal cavity. In addition to nerve fibers, it includes three nerve nodes, the size of which can be from 0.5 to 4.5 cm.


The nervous system provides control of the work of various organs of the human body, as well as its coordination. It is divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of 12 pairs of cranial and 31 pairs of spinal nerves. It forms plexuses and nerve nodes..TOPIC 7


Spinal Cord


33


Before proceeding to the study of the human spinal cord, remember what structural features the human spine has. What animals have a spinal cord? What departments is the human nervous system divided into? To which of these departments does the spinal cord belong?


Shape and size of the spinal cord The spinal cord is located in a special canal inside the spine. It starts from the edge of the occipital foramen and ends at the level of the 1st or 2nd lumbar vertebrae. In an adult, the length of the spinal cord is 40â€“45 cm, and the width is 1â€“1.5 cm, and its mass is on average 35 g. The spinal cord is separated from the walls of the canal by a layer of fatty tissue that protects it from damage, and the meninges. Inside the brain passes the spinal canal, filled with fluid. The spinal cord has two thickenings - cervical and lumbar. In these places, nerves that regulate the work of the upper and lower extremities depart from it. In total, 31 pairs of spinal nerves depart from the spinal cord. It should be noted that the spinal cord has a well-pronounced segmental structure: each pair of spinal nerves departs from a certain segment and exits between the vertebrae. The length of the spinal cord is less than that of the spine, so the nerves that should exit between the lumbar or sacral vertebrae first go down the spinal canal and only then come out.


MeningesThe spinal cord is covered externally by three membranes: the inner soft, the middle arachnoid, and the outer hard. The soft (vascular) membrane is directly adjacent to the outer surface of the brain, which enters all the cracks and grooves. It is quite thin, formed by loose tissue rich in elastic fibers and blood vessels. The arachnoid membrane is located outside the vascular
membrane. Between the soft and arachnoid membranes there is a cavity
filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Both of these membranes are covered with a single-layered squamous epithelium. On top of the arachnoid is a hard

meninges, which is formed by dense fibrous tissue, due to which it is very strong. In the spinal canal, the hard shell is fixed by processes and, like a bag, covers the spinal cord and the rest of the shells.

Internal structure and functions of the spinal cord


White matter


Gray matter


Fig. 33.1. Cross-section of the spinal cord


The spinal cord is formed by white and gray matter (Fig. 33.1). Gray matter is a cluster of spinal cord neuron bodies located around the spinal canal. On the cut, it has the shape of a butterfly or the letter H. Outside the gray matter is the white matter, which consists mainly of axons covered with a myelin sheath. These axons form the brain's pathways. The spinal cord's pathways transmit information to the brain and back to the organs. There are two types of pathways: ascending (sensory), which conduct impulses to the brain, and descending (motor), which conduct impulses from the brain. Thus, the spinal cord performs two main functions - conduction and reflex. It is the place where the neurons of the reflex arc connect and the intervening neurons are located. Most of the simplest reflex arcs pass through the spinal cord.


The spinal cord ends below the first lumbar vertebra. However, nerves continue to go through the spinal canal, forming a structure called the "cauda equina".


The spinal cord performs reflex and conduction functions. It contains gray and white matter. The white matter forms conduction pathways that transmit signals to the brain and organs of the body. Externally, the spinal cord is covered with three membranes - the dura, the arachnoid, and the soft. 31 pairs of spinal nerves depart from it..TOPIC 7

Before proceeding to the study of the human brain, remember what structural features the human skull has. What animals have a brain? What departments is the human nervous system divided into? To which of these departments does the brain belong?


Cerebral cortex


Cerebral cortex Cerebral cortex Cerebral cortex


Cranial nerves


Shape and size of the brain The brain is the central organ of the nervous system, which regulates and coordinates all processes in the body and is responsible for human mental activity and consciousness. The brain is located in the skull and fills its internal cavity during development. Externally, the brain is covered with the same three membranes as the spinal cord. 12 pairs of cranial nerves depart from it (Fig. 34.1). Inside the brain are four ventricles of the brain,
which are extensions of the spinal canal. They synthesize
cerebrospinal fluid, which protects the brain and spinal cord from damage, creating a liquid "cushion" during concussions. It regulates intracranial pressure, maintains the constancy of the internal environment in the brain and transports substances between blood vessels and brain cells. The mass of the brain varies within quite wide limits - between 1000 and 2000 g. The average mass of the brain in men is 1375 g, and in women - 1275 g. There is no direct connection between the mass of a person's brain and the level of his intelligence.


Cerebellum


Medulla oblongata


Departments of the brain The brain is divided into several large departments. Each of these departments performs certain functions, although they are all closely related to each other (Fig. 34.2). How the departments of the brain differ from each other is described in the table.

This is the highest department of the central nervous system, which controls the activities of other departments of the brain and the spinal cord and provides complex forms of behavior. Cerebrum


Outside
the cerebrum is the gray matter, which forms the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres, and inside is the white matter. In the thickness of the white matter there are several nuclei (clusters of gray matter).


It regulates the activity of the endocrine glands, participates in the processes of sleep, memory, instinctive behavior, and mental reactions.


Diemen's brain consists of interconnected nuclei located around the third ventricle of the brain. The diemen's brain includes the hypothalamus

Cerebral cortex The cortex of the cerebral hemispheres is the surface layer of gray matter. It is formed by the bodies of nerve cells, the spaces between which are filled with neuroglia cells and contain nerve fibers and blood vessels. The presence of numerous furrows and convolutions significantly increases the surface area of the gray matter. The total area of the cortex is 220 thousand mm 2 . The thickness of the cortex in different areas is different and ranges from 1.3 to 4.5 mm. It contains 14â€“15 billion neurons of various shapes, sizes and functions. The cortex of the cerebral hemispheres has a very complex structure. Starting from the surface, cells form several layers arranged in a certain sequence in the depth of the cortex. The cerebral cortex is divided into several lobes, each of which is responsible for certain processes (Fig. 34.3). The frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes are distinguished. Thus, the frontal lobe contains the motor zone, the parietal lobe contains the zone of skin-muscle sensitivity, the temporal lobe contains the zone of hearing, smell, and taste, and the occipital lobe contains the zone of vision. Thus, the cerebral cortex regulates
all the vital processes of the organism, and also provides the organism with a connection
with the external environment.


Ventricles of the Brain The brain was formed in the process of evolution from the anterior part of the spinal cord. And, as you already know, a characteristic feature of the spinal


cord


is the presence of the spinal canal, which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. This canal has also been preserved in the brain. Only there it has transformed into four cerebral ventricles - cavities located inside the brain. They are designated by numbers: first, second, third, and fourth. The first and second ventricles are paired lateral. The first is considered to be the left ventricle, and the second is the right ventricle. The ventricles of the brain are connected to the spinal cavity and, like it, are filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). They produce this fluid. The functions of the cerebrospinal fluid are to protect the brain and spinal cord from damage, to maintain brain homeostasis and intracranial pressure.


The mass of the brain of I. Turgenev was 2017 g, and A. France - 1017 g, but both of them became outstanding writers. Over the past 20 thousand years, the size of the human brain has decreased somewhat. If in Cro-Magnons of the Upper Paleolithic its volume was approximately 1500 cm 3 , then in modern man it is 1425 cm 3 (in men). This is even less than in late Neanderthals! The body of an adult contains 100â€“150 ml of cerebrospinal fluid.


The brain is the central organ of the nervous system. It coordinates and regulates all processes in the
human body. The main departments of the brain are the terminal,
midbrain, diencephalon, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The highest level of coordination is carried out by the cortex of the anterior hemispheres of the terminal brain. It is also responsible for human mental activity..TOPIC 7


Autonomic Nervous System


35


Before proceeding to the study of the autonomic nervous system, recall what functions the human nervous system performs. What departments is it divided into? What is included in the peripheral nervous system?


Autonomic Nervous SystemThe autonomic (autonomic) nervous system is a part of the peripheral nervous system that regulates the activity of internal organs, glands, blood vessels, smooth and some striated muscles, and also controls metabolic processes.The autonomic nervous system consists of two departments that have opposite effects on the organs and tissues of the body - sympathetic and parasympathetic (Fig. 35.1). The highest control center of the autonomic nervous system is the hypothalamus, a part of the midbrain that also controls the endocrine system. The activity of the autonomic nervous system is not subject to human will: we cannot consciously control the work of our internal organs, as, for example, we control our muscles. That is why this part of the nervous system is also called autonomous.


sympathetic nervous system
The nerve fibers of this system come from the brain and spinal
cord. The ganglia (nerve nodes) of the sympathetic system are located along the spinal cord. As a neurotransmitter, the cells use noradrenaline, which has an exciting effect on the body, increases the intensity of metabolism, enhances rhythmic forms of activity, lowers sensitivity thresholds. The sympathetic nervous system accelerates the heart, narrows the lumen of blood vessels, increases blood pressure, stimulates metabolism in the cells and tissues of the body, etc. It becomes active when we experience different emotions (fear, anger) or are faced with significant stress (heavy physical labor, sports competitions). Thus, the sympathetic system contributes to the intensive activity of the body, especially in extreme conditions, when all its forces are required.

parasympathetic nervous system


Fig. 35.1. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system


The nerve fibers of this system, like the sympathetic system, originate from the brain and spinal cord. The ganglia are located near the organ whose activity they regulate
. Cells
use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter, which has an inhibitory effect on the body, reduces the intensity of metabolism and rhythmic forms of activity, and restores sensitivity thresholds. The parasympathetic nervous system causes a slowdown in the heart rate, dilation of the lumen of blood vessels, a decrease in blood pressure, and also affects the processes associated with the restoration of used substances in cells and tissues. It works actively in situations when the body is at rest.


Regulation of the body's work by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems


The activity of almost all internal organs can be coordinated by both departments of the autonomic nervous system - sympathetic and parasympathetic. Such dual control provides better regulation of the work of organs.


The activity of internal organs is coordinated and regulated by the autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic system promotes intensive activity of the body, especially in extreme conditions, and the parasympathetic system actively works in situations when the body is at rest..TOPIC 7


36 Diseases of the nervous system


Before proceeding to the study of disorders of
the human nervous system, remember which organs
are part of it. What functions does it perform? What diseases of the nervous system do you know?


Encephalitis Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. The causes of inflammation can be different - infections, allergic reactions or the action of toxins. The most common pathogens of infectious encephalitis are viruses, but it can also be caused by bacteria, protozoa or fungi. Inflammation of the brain is a very dangerous disease that can lead to death. Encephalitis is much easier to prevent than to cure. To avoid getting sick with it, vaccinations are given and bites of ticks or mosquitoes, which are carriers of the pathogens of this disease, are prevented (Fig. 36.1). Allergic or toxic encephalitis can be prevented by avoiding contact with allergens and toxins.


Fig. 36.1. Tick that transmits encephalitis Meningitis


Meningitis is an inflammation of the soft meninges. As in the case of encephalitis, the causes of inflammation can be different, for example, the action of pathogenic microorganisms or certain substances that can cause inflammatory processes in the meninges. The causative agents of meningitis can be viruses, bacteria, fungi and some parasitic worms. Usually they enter the human body through unwashed hands or by airborne droplets, so the best prevention of this disease is to follow the rules of personal hygiene. In some cases, vaccination against certain meningitis pathogens is also possible. Among the non-infectious factors of meningitis are the action of certain antibiotics, anti-
inflammatory and other drugs.


128. Disease of the nervous system


poliomyelitisPoliomyelitis is a serious infectious disease that can lead to damage to the central nervous system. The causative agent of poliomyelitis is a virus. Children under 5 years of age are most vulnerable to it. In case of damage to the central nervous system, paralysis or even death of the patient is possible. Like some other infections, poliomyelitis is quite easy to prevent, but it cannot be cured. Vaccination is used to prevent this disease. A child who gets polio and is not vaccinated may remain paralyzed for life.


NeuritisInflammation can occur not only in the central nervous system. If it affects the peripheral nerves, then neuritis occurs. The causes of neuritis, as well as inflammation of the central nervous system, can be infections - herpes zoster, Lyme disease, leprosy, etc. Some pathogens can be transmitted directly from person to person (for example, through unwashed hands), and some, like the Lyme disease pathogen, through tick bites. Very often, the cause of neuritis is mechanical damage to the nerve as a result of physical trauma. To prevent neuritis, physical trauma should be avoided and the pathogens of the corresponding diseases should be prevented from entering the body.


Lyme disease got its name from the name of the American town of Old Lyme, where it was first discovered. However, this disease also occurs on all other continents, except perhaps Antarctica. Its causative agent is the spiral-shaped bacterium Borrelia, which enters the human body through tick bites. Although humans are an accidental habitat for Borrelia: it usually affects wild ungulates.


Diseases of the nervous system include encephalitis, meningitis, neuritis, poliomyelitis, etc. They can be caused by infection, allergic reactions, the action of toxins, or physical damage. Prevention of these diseases allows you to avoid serious health consequences. Generalization on the topic "The connection between the human body and the external environment. Nervous system"
