    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The Czech government actually rejected the Russian accusation, as Brabec claims, and the Russian ambassador was indeed invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We assess the statement as true despite Brabec&#39;s inaccuracy that Minister Stropnický himself negotiated with the Russian ambassador. In reality, it was his deputy Šrámek.</p><p> The government opposed the Russian accusation <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/v-ceske-republice-nebyla-nikdy-vyrabena--vyvijena-ani-skladovana-zadna-latka-typu-novicok-165391/\">in a statement</a> issued after Prime Minister Babiš&#39;s meeting with the directors of the BIS and Military Intelligence. It states, among other things, that:</p><p> <i>&quot;No Novichok-type substance has ever been produced, developed or stored in the Czech Republic. This was stated unanimously by both intelligence services in their reports. In the Czech Republic, a program for the protection of troops and the population and the detection of weapons of mass destruction was launched in 2017. As part of this program, the Novichok A-230 substance was to be tested.</i></p><p> <i>In the first phase, the microsynthesis of the substance Novichok A-230 was carried out. During the microsynthesis, the substance was not isolated and this procedure is not considered production or development according to the methodology of the State Office for Nuclear Safety. The resulting product was immediately destroyed. The second phase of the program was not started. The substance of the Novichok A-230 type is different from the substance A-234, which was used in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom. The two substances are completely different and have a clearly different chemical structure.</i></p><p> Subsequently, as Brabec claims, the Russian ambassador was indeed invited. The Russian ambassador was <a href=\"https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/zive-stropnicky-si-predvolal-ruskeho-velvyslance-proc-moskva/r~272826e22d0e11e89efbac1f6b220ee8/\">informed of the Czech Republic&#39;s reservations</a> regarding Russia&#39;s accusation of producing Novichok (video from 4:57). However, the meeting with the Russian ambassador was not attended by Minister Stropnický, but by his deputy Šrámek (video from 00:10).</p>\nSECTION B: <p>On 17 December 2018, the government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/scripts/modules/fs/icv.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/tiskove-zpravy/vysledky-jednani-vlady-17--prosince-2018-170824/\">approved</a> a draft law amending Act No. 248/2000 Coll., on the support of regional development, as amended. The draft law was submitted by <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/klara-dostalova-167026/\">the Minister</a> for Regional Development Klára Dostálová. Specifically, it is intended to amend Section 18(8) <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-248#p18-8\">of Act</a> No. 248/2000 Coll., which currently reads as follows: “ <em>The Council for the European Structural and Investment Funds (hereinafter referred to as the “Council”) is hereby established, which is an advisory body to the Government.</em> <strong><em>The Chairman of the Council is the Prime Minister.</em></strong> <em>Its members are representatives of central state administration bodies and representatives of advisory and working bodies of the Government. Details regarding the composition, powers, organization and activities of the Council shall be determined by its statute, which shall be approved by the Government.</em> ”</p><p> The proposed <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNB7JCKHND\">amendment</a> (.docx) states: &quot; <em>In Section 18, paragraph 8, second sentence, of Act No. 248/2000 Coll., on the support of regional development, as amended by Act No. 298/2015 Coll. and Act No. 367/2017 Coll., the word &#39;</em> <em><strong>chairman&#39; is replaced by the word &#39;member&#39;</strong></em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNB7JCKGTJ\">The amendment&#39;s submission report</a> (.docx) also states that, until the amendment enters into force, the Council&#39;s Statute will entrust its presidency to the Executive Vice-Chairman of the Council, i.e. the Minister for Regional Development.</p><p> The current competences of the Council are defined by <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/getmedia/6f1b6426-6d19-486c-9e74-d4099dfd18ae/Statut-Rada-ESIF.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf\">the Statute of the Council</a> (.pdf), adopted by the government resolution of 27 April 2016. According to this document, the Council is an advisory body to the government regarding the coordination of assistance provided from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). According to Article 2, point 2. part c), the Council <em>&quot;discusses the substantive interface and connections between programmes co-financed by the ESI Funds with a focus on ensuring synergistic effects&quot;.</em></p><p> <em>Or</em> , in the words of Minister Brabec, is this body really<em> </em>&quot; <em>recommends systemic solutions to the government, for example in terms of drawing down European funds, or is responsible for the implementation and the relationship between individual programs and the drawing down of funds for individual program objectives.</em> &quot;</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Marek Turčáni mentioned in the statement is <a href=\"https://www.fld.czu.cz/cs/r-6823-o-fakulte\">the Dean of</a> the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Science at the Czech University of Life Sciences. A statement in which Turčáni states what Minister Brabec attributes to him cannot be found in publicly available sources. However, Turčáni has long been dedicated to the issue of Czech forests and the impacts that climate change will have on these forests and the bark beetle living in them ( <a href=\"https://home.czu.cz/turcani/publikace\">see</a> Turčáni&#39;s publication activities).</p><p> In the Czech Television 90&#39; program (broadcast on May 23, 2018), which dealt with the ongoing bark beetle disaster, Turčáni <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/11412378947-90-ct24/218411058130523-kurovcova-kalamita\">states</a> : &quot; <em>At the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Science, we started solving projects funded by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2007 and 2008, where we actually solved some probable development of how the bark beetle here would react to climate change in some way. We published those results in 2011, where it was clear that the bark beetle would increase the number of generations it would produce during the year from two to three. And that is a crucial thing for the negative development.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 21:47)<em> </em>Furthermore, when asked who is to blame, who overslept and did not respond properly to the published warnings, Turčáni answers:<em> </em>&quot; <em>I think it wasn&#39;t a priority at the time because it seemed terribly unlikely to everyone. (...) These results were paid for by the Ministry of Agriculture and of course we provided them all to the Ministry of Agriculture in full. I personally informed Mr. Szorád, the general director of the Forests of the Czech Republic (then director, Demagog.cz note) about this potential danger</em> <strong>.</strong> &quot;<strong><em> </em></strong><em>I suggested to him that we establish joint committees to solve such problems. And Mr. Szorád, the general director, told me that he knew what to do, that he didn&#39;t need any advice.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 23:26) The people of Turčany speak about the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Forests of the Czech Republic.</p><p> In another statement for Czech Television (May 15, 2018), <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1096898594-udalosti-komentare/218411000370515/\">he stated</a> : &quot; <em>I can confirm that it did not happen, because in the spring of 2016 I personally spoke with Minister Jurečka, to whom I emphasized that there was a huge, huge problem with the bark beetle, and I urged him to start solving the situation.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(video from 33:40)<em> </em>This meeting was subsequently confirmed in a video by former Minister Jurečka himself.</p><p> Let us add that Turčáni draws attention in his studies to dangerous factors that can lead to an escalation of the bark beetle disaster. For example, <a href=\"http://lesniportal.cz/downloads/2016/Zprava/Zprava_Final.pdf\">he draws attention</a> to the inappropriate composition of the forest in the Czech Republic (p. 25) and the need to prepare for increasing temperatures and droughts (p. 13, 14). He also <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/11412378947-90-ct24/218411058130523-kurovcova-kalamita\">speaks</a> about the inappropriateness of the current legislation and the insufficient capacities of the Forests of the Czech Republic, which are unable to deal with the ongoing bark beetle disaster (video from 7:45).</p><p> Turčáni has indeed been warning for a long time about the danger of a gradation of the bark beetle crisis. He repeatedly speaks about the shared responsibility of both the Ministry of Agriculture and the Forests of the Czech Republic.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Simply put, Brabec says in his statement that according to experts, spruce thrives in a wetter climate than a drier one, and that all experts claim this today. This corresponds to our research in the professional literature. We have reviewed several studies, in which, for example, the following formulations are found:</p><p> &quot; <em>Wiping and dying are affecting spruce stands of all ages, both artificially established and naturally regenerated. The mechanism of damage is not described in detail, but its basic cause is fluctuations in meteorological conditions, which can be linked to ongoing global climate change. The triggering mechanism of catastrophic damage is recurring periods of drought.</em> &quot; (V. Šrámek and K. Neudertová Hellebrandová, VULHM, p. 305, <a href=\"http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/ZLV/fulltext/469.pdf\">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>Spring and summer drought episodes are demonstrably not only a factor limiting plant growth, but also a significant predisposing stressor. Drought increases sensitivity to some biotic diseases (in particular, a higher incidence of vascular mycoses and diseases of the assimilation apparatus can be expected) and also increases the threat from insect pests.</em> &quot; (P. Čermák, VULHM, p. 9, <a href=\"http://www.vulhm.cz/sites/File/Sbornik_Budisov_2014_final_komp.pdf#page=11\">here</a> )</p><p> &quot; <em>The most vulnerable point in the stability of spruce stands growing in the Czech Republic in lower forest vegetation stages (in the 5th to 3rd LVS) is the disruption of its moisture balance with a direct impact on the soil moisture regime and water reserves in the soil.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(P. Hadaš, LDF MZLU, <a href=\"http://cbks.cz/sbornik05b/Hadas2.pdf\">here</a> ).</p><p> In the studies we searched for, it is repeatedly stated that drought is a threatening factor for the growth of spruce trees. It is not in our power to determine whether all experts claim this, as Brabec says. However, the fact is that we were unable to find a study that would claim the opposite.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Crimea was <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-61891160-krym-a-sevastopol-oficialne-patri-k-rusku-putin-podepsal-smlouvu-o-pripojeni\">annexed</a> by Russia on 21 March 2014. The annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia was preceded by a referendum announced by the Crimean parliament, which was held on 16 March 2014. The referendum <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1043406-krym-o-referendum-byl-velky-zajem\">asked</a> the following two questions:</p><p> &quot; <em>Are you in favor of the reunification of Crimea with Russia with the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation?</em> &quot;</p><p> &quot; <em>Are you in favor of restoring the 1992 constitution and the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine?</em> &quot;</p><p> However, as has been pointed out (e.g. <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-61857960-zive-pro-pripojeni-krymu-k-rusku-je-pres-95-procent-lidi-eu-rozhodne-o-sankcich\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/world/europe/crimea-vote-does-not-offer-choice-of-status-quo.html\">here</a> ), the difference on these issues is minimal. The 1992 constitution, adopted at the time of the collapse of the USSR, granted Crimea extensive autonomy. Crimea was annexed to Ukraine in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev and had previously belonged to Russia for 170 years.</p><p> Shortly after Russia&#39;s annexation of Crimea, pro-Russian militants in eastern Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/donbas-obse-ukrajina-prorusti-povstalci_1808031711_dbr\">occupied</a> the Donbas and Luhansk regions and declared two people&#39;s republics. According to Ukraine, Moscow is the military backer of the separatists. Moscow has long <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/donbas-armada/r~94f2eca2880411e7aec7002590604f2e/\">denied</a> sending Russian troops to the Donbas. However, in 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/vladimir-putin-admits-russian-military-presence-ukraine\">told</a> a press conference: &quot; <em>We never said that there were no people there who performed certain tasks in the military sphere</em> .&quot;<em> </em>However, according to him, this is not the same as sending Russian troops.</p><p> In February 2017, the UN issued <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21730&amp;LangID=E\">a report</a> according to which the conflict in Donbass had already claimed 10,090 victims, of which 2,777 were civilians. In 2014, the first Minsk Agreement was <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/EPRS/EPRS-Briefing-548991-Minsk-peace-summit-FINAL.pdf\">negotiated</a> (.pdf, p. 2) between Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, but it was soon violated by pro-Russian separatists who seized territory in eastern Ukraine. In February 2015, the second Minsk Agreement was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/1502444-uspesny-minsk-dohoda-na-primeri-i-demarkacni-linii\">reached</a> in Belarus, which agreed on a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, an amnesty for all participants in the fighting, and also, for example, a constitutional reform allowing for the decentralization of rebel areas by the end of the year. According to the UN, both agreements are still <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/osn-donbas-civilisti-ukrajina-minska-dohoda-poruseni_1806210808_gol\">being violated</a> by both sides.</p><p> The Council of the EU condemned the annexation of Crimea. On 17 March 2014, <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/meetings/fac/2014/03/17/\">it adopted</a> &quot; <em>restrictive measures against 21 individuals and persons and entities associated with them in connection with their involvement in activities that threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.</em> &quot;<em> </em>The foreign ministers also condemned the Crimean referendum at this Council and did not recognise its result. The Council considered the referendum held to be illegal and in clear violation of the Ukrainian constitution. Since March 2014, the EU has adopted a series <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/\">of restrictive measures</a> against Russia in response to the Ukrainian crisis. Most recently, in September 2018, <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/history-ukraine-crisis/\">it extended</a> the sanctions imposed in connection with the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p><p> The annexation of Crimea is contrary to international law, as stated in <a href=\"http://www.osn.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/charta-organizace-spojenych-narodu-a-statut-mezinarodniho-soudniho-dvora.pdf\">the UN Charter</a> (.pdf, p. 5) in Article 2, paragraph 4:</p><p> <em>4.</em> &quot; <em>All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.</em> &quot;<em><br/></em><br/> As Christian Marxsen of the Planck Institute also <a href=\"http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf4/Marxsen_2014_-_The_crimea_crisis_-_an_international_law_perspective.pdf\">summarizes</a> (.pdf), Russian arguments about protecting the Russian-speaking population abroad or intervention based on invitation will not stand up under international law.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Two parliamentary proposals dealing with the definition of marriage were recently submitted to the Chamber of Deputies. According to the first <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135812\">proposal</a> (.pdf), which was sent to deputies on June 13, the Civil Code and related regulations should be amended, and the definition of marriage contained therein as a union between a man and a woman should be changed to a union between two people.</p><p> The proposal to equalize same-sex unions <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=201&amp;sp=1\">was submitted by</a> a group of deputies from ANO, Pirates, ČSSD, TOP 09, KSČM and STAN. The Pirates club was the most united in this case, with seventeen out of the total twenty-two deputies submitting the bill.</p><p> Two days later, another <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135903\">proposal</a> (.pdf) was sent to the deputies, according to which the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms should be amended, where Article 32 would be supplemented with an explicit definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Currently, the first sentence <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-2#cl32-1\">of Article 32</a> protects parenthood and the family; if the amendment to the Charter is approved, parenthood, family and marriage as a union between a man and a woman would be protected.</p><p> The proposal to amend the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=211&amp;sp=1\">was submitted by</a> a group of deputies from the parliamentary groups ANO, KDU-ČSL, ODS, ČSSD, TOP 09 and STAN. Apart from the KDU-ČSL club, where all ten deputies submitted the proposal, the other parliamentary groups were by no means united. </p><div><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-gCEa9\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gCEa9/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" height=\"390\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":471,\"200\":444,\"300\":417,\"400\":417,\"500\":390,\"700\":390,\"800\":390,\"900\":390,\"1000\":390},window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-gCEa9\"),window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"gCEa9\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"gCEa9\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});</script></div><p> From the table we can see that the deputies (with the exception of the KDU-ČSL club and to some extent the Pirates) do not really decide according to the party program, but very freely according to their own discretion. Thus, in several parliamentary clubs there are both streams of opinion, i.e. deputies who support equal rights for same-sex unions and those who, on the contrary, want to protect marriage as a union between a man and a woman by constitutional order.</p><p> In the last election period, <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=111102\">a proposal</a> (.pdf) to amend the Registered Partnership Act was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow registered partners to adopt the child of the other partner, thus ensuring the child&#39;s equal legal relationship to both partners. This proposal was also <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=7&amp;t=320&amp;sp=1\">submitted</a> by a very diverse group of MPs from six parliamentary groups (all except the KDU-ČSL group), but it was not voted on.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Jiří Pospíšil stated in an interview for Czech Radio that if Andrej Babiš proceeds in this way, he should offer the Italian government another form of assistance. Although he did not directly criticize his actions, he did not express direct approval either. That he would directly defend Babiš is indeed an abbreviation that was published by Parlamentní listy in its text.</p><p> The chairman of TOP 09 <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/jiri-pospisil-z-top-09-vadi-mi-legitimizace-kscm-a-personalni-nestabilita-vlady-7568537\">commented</a> on Andrej Babiš&#39;s response to the Italian government&#39;s refusal to accept some refugees (video, 7:12) on Radiožurnál&#39;s 20 minut program. However, he did not directly agree with the prime minister&#39;s decision, only stating that it would be good to offer Italy other assistance in such a case and not close ourselves off from further communication.</p><p> <em>&quot;I personally think that at a time when the Czech Republic and, in principle, the entire political representation rejects mandatory quotas, the redistribution of refugees against their will across Europe, it would be reasonable to offer the Italian side some other form of assistance than accepting refugees who are not going to the Czech Republic themselves and have not applied for asylum in the Czech Republic. I am convinced that we should grant asylum to those who apply for asylum in the Czech Republic and meet the conditions of Czech legislation and Czech laws.&quot;</em></p><p> His response <a href=\"https://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/arena/monitor/Sef-TOP-09-Pospisil-se-zastal-Babise-ve-veci-prijimani-uprchliku-Opravdu-544446\">was distorted by</a> Parlamentní listy, which incorrectly reported Jiří Pospíšil&#39;s agreement with Andrej Babiš in the headline of the article: &quot; <em>Top 09 boss Pospíšil stood up for Babiš on the issue of accepting refugees. Really.&quot;</em> Therefore, we assess the statement as true.</p><p> Miroslav Kalousek and Karel Schwarzenberg criticized Jiří Pospíšil&#39;s alleged statement as inconsistent with TOP09&#39;s current policy.

The coalition project was not formed only at the level of the party leadership, as Pospíšil states.</p><p> One of the first reports of possible cooperation between the KDU-ČSL and STAN appeared in December 2016, when the KDU-ČSL National Conference <a href=\"https://kdu.cz/aktualne/archiv/2016/kdu-csl-jsme-pripraveni-jednat-o-spolupraci-se-sta\">authorized</a> the party&#39;s presidium to begin negotiations for cooperation in the upcoming elections to the Chamber of Deputies in 2017.</p><p> Initially, there was the possibility of a so-called integration party, in which a new entity would be created, whose candidate lists would consist of members of two cooperating parties. However, this project was <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/info-a-media/tiskove-zpravy/o-koalici-s-kdu-csl-rozhodneme-brzy\">rejected by</a> the KDU-ČSL National Conference, and instead <a href=\"https://kdu.cz/aktualne/archiv/2017/kdu-csl-celostatni-konference-podporuje-dlouhodobo\">the conference authorized</a> the presidium to negotiate cooperation between the parties at the level of an electoral coalition.</p><p> The offer of coalition cooperation for the 2017 elections was accepted by the Mayor when a similar mandate for the leadership of STAN was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2032940-starostove-chteji-jit-do-voleb-v-koalici-s-lidovci-museli-ziskat-pres-10-procent\">approved by</a> 81% of the delegates <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/nasi-lide/celostatni-vybor-stan\">of the STAN National Committee.</a></p><p> The electoral coalition was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2060128-lidovci-souhlasi-se-spolecnou-koalici-se-starosty-pujdou-do-voleb\">approved</a> by the KDU-ČSL National Conference on 18 March 2017 with 39 delegates in favour and 31 against. A week later, the coalition cooperation was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2064908-starostove-chteji-kandidovat-s-lidovci-pro-koalici-bylo-86-procent-delegatu\">approved</a> by the STAN (Supreme Council of the Republic), with 101 out of 117 delegates voting in favour.</p><p> Based on these votes and ongoing negotiations, the parties <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/volby/archiv/parlamentni-volby-2017/nejnovejsi-informace/kdu-csl-a-stan-podepsali-koalicni-smlouvu\">signed</a> <a href=\"https://www.starostove-nezavisli.cz/fmfile/0/files/smlouva_STAN_KDU.pdf\">a coalition agreement</a> on April 12, 2017. This agreement was subsequently confirmed, and the coalition agreement approved, by the national congress of the KDU-ČSL on May 27, 2017. At which 228 out of 269 delegates present validly <a href=\"https://kdu.cz/akce/sjezd-2017/aktuality/clanky/celostatni-sjezd-schvalil-koalicni-smlouvu-mezi-kd\">voted</a> for the coalition.</p><p> The coalition cooperation was eventually <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/koalice-kdu-csl-a-stan-se-hrouti-lidovci-vyzvali-starosty-at-jsou-jen-jejich-priveskem-34479\">called off,</a> mainly due to concerns that the coalition&#39;s election results would not reach the 10% threshold required for the group to enter the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> Although the approval of the electoral coalition between STAN and KDU-ČSL for the 2017 elections was not always supported by an overwhelming majority of the membership base, its participation, albeit somewhat limited, in the approval process of their coalition cooperation cannot be denied.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p></p>\nSECTION E: <p>Part Two of the draft <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf\">Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community</a> (.pdf, hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Agreement&quot;) regulates (Agreement, p. 19, Article 10) among other things the rights and obligations of EU citizens residing or working in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens residing or working in European Union countries, as Jiří Pospíšil claims.</p><p> According to Article 12 (p. 23 of the Agreement), any discrimination against these citizens on grounds of nationality is generally prohibited and according to Article 23 (p. 42 of the Agreement), citizens of the Union and the United Kingdom are entitled to equal treatment. According to Article 13 (p. 24 of the Agreement) of this Agreement, the right of residence of these citizens will continue to be subject to European law.</p><p> According to Articles 15 and 16 of the Agreement (p. 27 and 28 of the Agreement), European law will apply to these citizens even in the case of obtaining permanent residence. According to Article 20 (p. 40 of the Agreement), European regulations will apply even when restricting the right of residence or entry (which is currently only possible in exceptional circumstances, e.g. for reasons of public security or public health), but only until the end of the so-called transition period (i.e. until 31 December 2020 – Article 126 of the Agreement), after the transition period it will be possible to restrict the right of residence and entry of EU citizens in the United Kingdom on the basis of British law and vice versa.</p><p> In general, there will be no discrimination between EU and UK citizens and EU citizens may become residents in the UK until the end of the transition period (31 December 2020), with their right of movement and residence governed by EU law to the extent set out in the EU <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038&amp;from=CS\">directive</a> , which will also apply to the UK by the end of 2020.</p><p> After the end of the transition period, restrictions on the rights of movement and residence may arise for EU citizens who come to the United Kingdom to obtain resident status, in accordance with Article 20/2 of the Agreement. However, this does not automatically mean that the right of residence and movement of an EU citizen in relation to the United Kingdom will be restricted. This may happen, but it is not certain and depends on the specific legislation of the United Kingdom.</p><p> Much more significant in this statement, however, is the overgeneralization of a complex matter by stating “ <em>they will have the same rights as they would have had if the United Kingdom were in the European Union</em> .” The aforementioned Article 20 of the Agreement regulates only the freedom of movement and residence, not all rights.</p><p> EU citizens who are also residents of the United Kingdom will thus be guaranteed the freedom of movement and residence under EU directives as they have been until now. However, Article 20 of the Agreement does not mention other rights granted by European Union legislation. At the same time, it is highly unlikely that the United Kingdom would maintain all the provisions governing the rights of EU citizens when it is no longer a member of the European Union.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

I think that was a poem by Vojtěch Mihálik, who later deserted to the regime, but wrote this beautiful poem at the time. Do you know who Dana Košanová was? She has a monument now and she was shot by a Soviet soldier, no tank, Mr. Soukup, normal shooting. I don&#39;t even know if it was from behind.\nSECTION B: Let me start the same way I did when I met with about a hundred foreign ambassadors. I said to them: Welcome to a successful country. A country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, that has stable economic growth, that has a relatively declining and relatively low national debt. A country where both the average wage and old-age pensions are growing.\nSECTION C: If I appoint him as Prime Minister, he will form a government, go to the Chamber of Deputies with that government and ask for confidence. If he does not receive that confidence, the President has one more chance to appoint the Prime Minister, it could be the same one, it could be the second one on the list, and so on, and according to the Constitution, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies then has a third chance.\nSECTION D: (...) a proposal that I have repeatedly expressed in my budget speeches in the Chamber of Deputies. This proposal consists of abolishing tax exemptions. If all tax exemptions were abolished, I said that it would save 380 billion crowns. Which is almost as much as the estimated state budget deficit this year.\nSECTION E: There were some property disputes there (at TV NOVA, note: Demagog.cz) and unfortunately we had to pay a fine of 10 billion crowns also because some institution, I don&#39;t know now if it was the media committee of the Chamber of Deputies or someone like that, said that everything was fine. So we agreed to it, and well, it wasn&#39;t fine.\nSECTION F: On the other hand, those who babble that it is nationalization should realize that a similar position was taken by the American administration, which you certainly cannot suspect of Bolshevism. For example, with General Motors. So they entered there and when General Motors got back on its feet, they sold their share again. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

After all, the focus of his work lies in the parliamentary club, where the chairman of the parliamentary club was elected last week and Jakub Michálek defended him.\nSECTION B: He is on the election committee (Lukáš Wagenknecht, note: Demagog.cz), which elected him himself. There are a lot of people on the election committee. People from the media department, our politicians, regional campaign coordinators, and Lukáš Wagenknecht was elected there as the head who deals with the preparation of the campaign, its financing and coordination.\nSECTION C: EDITOR: But you had a campaign based on a bus, in which you had pictures of various politicians. IVAN BARTOŠ: There was a funny bus, so everyone was in civilian clothes, there were caricatures and people from the Social Democrats were sitting there. People who were in the government for the KDU-ČSL and then for TOP 09, for example, were sitting there.\nSECTION D: So I&#39;ll just briefly talk about Lukáš Wagenknecht. Andrej Babiš brought him to finance as a top analyst who fights corruption.

In fact, the government retained a kind of preferential right to announce its decisions to people, politicians, and companies through press conferences, and only then was the Central Crisis Staff created, which was supposed to be a body consisting of experts, which provides the government with the documents, and based on them, the government takes individual measures.\nSECTION F: I found something here that you wrote when the case started.

It is holding the ships, 84% and they didn&#39;t have oil in August. So Prime Minister Conte was dealing with oil, because it is a state-owned company, but the government was not able to force them to give the Libyan guard oil so that they could hold the ships.\nSECTION B: He (Miloš Zeman, note: Demagog.cz) was known to Mr. Sobotka, who first went to the president with the nomination of Mr. Prouza to head the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and when he told Sobotka that he would never appoint Prouza, he came up with another name and did not even propose Prouza. It was the same with my dismissal, which he did not push through, so I resigned myself.\nSECTION C: ...and I discussed it with him (Wolfgang Schäuble - note: Demagogue) and he always understood us, he saw it at the press conference and said yes, here is the Czech Republic, and the V4 have a different history, they don&#39;t have the multicultural model and we don&#39;t want it, because the foreigners haven&#39;t been integrated in the individual states. \nSECTION D: Why, at a time when no foreign power threatens us or interferes in our affairs, and we, as a state and as citizens, truly have our destiny in our own hands for the first time in centuries, do we have so few reasons for joyful satisfaction? These words were uttered exactly 28 years ago, in 1992, in the New Year&#39;s speech of the then President Václav Havel.\nSECTION E: On April 24, a petition demanding Stanek&#39;s dismissal was created, and on April 28, the vice-chairman of the ČSSD Onderka began demanding the dismissal of his own minister, contrary to the position of his own chairman.
