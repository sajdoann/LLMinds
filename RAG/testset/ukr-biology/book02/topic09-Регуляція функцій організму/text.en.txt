Regulation of body functions


Homeostasis and regulation of body functions. Nervous regulation


49


Before proceeding to the study of the regulation of functions in the human body, recall what functions the circulatory and nervous systems perform. What are the structural features of neurons? How does their structure allow them to effectively perform these functions?


Homeostasis and systems for regulating functions You are already familiar with the concept of homeostasis. So, homeostasis is the relative constancy of the composition and properties of the internal environment of the organism. It is a characteristic feature of all living organisms. As a result of vital processes, the constancy of the internal environment is constantly disturbed, but is immediately restored. This restoration is carried out thanks to the work of the regulatory systems of the organism. In the human body, the regulation of processes related to maintaining homeostasis is carried out by three main systems: the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. The nervous and endocrine systems regulate and coordinate the work of organs, and the immune system protects the body from disorders that can be caused by other organisms or harmful substances.


Principles of regulation of functions Nervous regulation is carried out using impulses transmitted along the membranes of nerve cells, while the endocrine system regulates processes in the body using special chemicals - hormones. The relationship between the two types of regulation is manifested in the fact that the nervous and humoral systems influence each other. Thus, the nervous system can cause changes in the intensity of the release of biologically
active substances, and the action of hormones can cause the occurrence of

nerve impulses and regulate the work of individual parts of the nervous system. For example, when a person finds himself in a dangerous situation, signals from the nervous system cause the release of hormones that mobilize the body's resources to save him. In such cases, a person can lift very heavy objects or jump a long distance, which is impossible for him in a normal state. There is also a reverse effect. As a result of some joyful event, for example, winning a competition, the body releases hormones that act on the brain and cause positive emotions.


Nervous regulation Nervous regulation is carried out primarily by the autonomic nervous system. As you already know, its activity is based on the principle of antagonism (counteraction). The processes stimulated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are opposite. For example, the sympathetic nervous system accelerates the heartbeat, while the parasympathetic slows it down. As a result, their simultaneous and coordinated action allows for very precise regulation of the work of internal organs. However, nervous regulation is designed mainly for a quick and short-term effect, so if prolonged intervention in the activity of an organ or system of organs is required, the humoral mechanism of regulation works more effectively.


The French physiologist C. Bernard was the first to draw attention to the fact that living organisms counteract external factors that can disrupt the conditions necessary for their vital activity.


The term "homeostasis" was proposed by the American physiologist W. Cannon in 1929.


To maintain homeostasis - the relative constancy of the composition and properties of the internal environment - the human body is operated by the nervous, humoral and immune regulation systems. The regulation systems interact with each other and influence each other. Nervous regulation of the work of internal organs is carried out by the autonomic nervous system..TOPIC 10


Humoral regulation. Hormones

Before moving on to the study of humoral regulation of functions in the human body, remember what substances the circulatory system carries. What functions do proteins perform? What glands are there in the human body?


Humoral regulationHumoral regulation is the coordination of physiological functions of the human body through liquid media - blood, lymph, tissue fluid. Factors of humoral regulation are biologically active substances (hormones) and metabolic products (protein breakdown products, carbon dioxide, etc.). An important role in humoral regulation is played by glands that produce hormones. Endocrine glands (endocrine glands) secrete the substances they have produced into the blood. It should be noted that there are two more types of glands in the human body - exocrine and mixed. Exocrine glands (exocrine glands) secrete substances into the external environment or into internal cavities of the body, such as the lacrimal and salivary glands. Mixed glands secrete substances both into the blood and into body cavities or outside (pancreas, gonads). One of the features of humoral regulation is the work of its regulatory
substances in interaction, because its factors do not act alone, but only
in a complex. Some of them accelerate certain processes in cells and tissues, while others slow them down. This allows for very fine regulation of the speeds and directions of processes controlled by humoral regulation. For example, the simultaneous action of insulin, which reduces the amount of sugar in the blood, and glucagon, which increases this amount, allows for very precise regulation of the level of sugar in the circulatory system.


HormonesHormones are specific biologically active substances that exert their effect far from the site of synthesis. Hormones are characterized by selectivity of action: they act only on cells that are sensitive to them. This feature is due to the fact that special structures are located on the surface of cells â€” receptors that react only to molecules of a certain hormone. More information about hormones is in the table.

Humoral regulation is carried out in the human body with the help of metabolic products and hormones. Hormones act far from the place of their synthesis and have
a high selectivity of action, that is, they affect only
those cells that have the corresponding molecular structures on their surface..TOPIC 10


Endocrine system


51


Before moving on to the study of the endocrine system, remember what humoral regulation is. What functions do hormones perform? What hormones are produced in the human body?


What is the endocrine system? The endocrine system is a set of organs, parts of organs and individual cells that secrete (release) hormones into the blood and lymph. Together with the nervous system, it regulates and coordinates important functions of the human body: growth, reproduction, metabolism, adaptation processes.


Hypothalamus


Anterior lobe


of the pituitary gland Thyroid gland


Ovary


Adrenal cortex
Structure of the endocrine system The endocrine system distinguishes between central and peripheral departments, which interact with each other and form a single whole. The organs of the central department are closely connected with the organs of the central nervous system and coordinate the activities of all other parts of the endocrine system. These include the pituitary gland, hypothalamus and pineal gland. The organs of the peripheral department actively influence the body, strengthen or weaken metabolic processes. These are glands such as the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, etc. Glands of mixed secretion are often considered as a separate group within the endocrine system. They simultaneously work as glands of internal and external secretion. These include the pancreas, testes, and ovaries. Learn about the functions of the endocrine system glands from the table.

The endocrine system of the human body regulates its vital activity by producing hormones. The glands of the endocrine system include glands of both internal and mixed secretion. The glands of internal secretion secrete synthesized substances only into the blood, and the glands of mixed secretion - both into the blood and into the body cavities or into the external environment..TOPIC 10


Endocrine system disorders


52


Before moving on to the study of disorders of the human endocrine system, remember what hormones are. What functions does the endocrine system perform? What glands are part of it? What other organ system regulates the course of processes in the human body?


Endocrine gland dysfunctions The glands of the endocrine system must work very precisely, because even minor disruptions in their hormone production can lead to extremely negative consequences. Disorders occur both in the case of insufficient hormone production and in the case of their excessive production. Insufficient activity of the endocrine glands is called hypofunction, and excessive activity is called
hyperfunction.
The consequences of endocrine gland disorders are described in the table.


Disorders of the endocrine glands


Endocrine glands Hyperfunction Hypofunction


Leads to the development of dwarfism and delayed sexual development


Pituitary gland Leads to the development of gigantism or acromegaly (excessive growth of individual parts of the body)


Thyroid gland


Leads to the development of basal disease. It is expressed in a general increase in the intensity of metabolism, while very often the gland grows (goiter is formed). The development of bulging, trembling fingers, rapid heartbeat, and weight loss are observed


Leads to the development of hypothyroidism. It is expressed in a general decrease in the intensity of metabolism, skin edema, hair loss, rapid fatigue, a decrease in body temperature and blood pressure. Thyroid tissue often grows (goiter is formed)


Parathyroid glands


Calcium content in the blood decreases, convulsive muscle contractions are observed


Cavities form in the bones of the skeleton, bone fragility increases, kidney stones are often formed

Hypoglycemia


(insulin shock) - a significant decrease in the level of glucose in the blood


Insufficient secretion of insulin leads to the development of diabetes mellitus


Adrenal cortex


Excessive fat deposition on the trunk, changes in facial shape, increased blood pressure, bone fragility are observed


Addison's disease develops. Weight loss, bronze-colored skin, decreased blood pressure, and impaired water-salt metabolism are observed .


Sometimes the symptoms of dysfunction of various endocrine glands
are similar. For example, in addition to regular diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus may develop. It has similar symptoms and also causes increased urine output, but the cause is not the pancreas, but the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. In this case, the disease is caused by the absence of another hormone â€” not insulin, but antidiuretic hormone (ADH).


Causes of endocrine gland dysfunction There are many reasons for the dysfunction of the endocrine glands. They can malfunction due to hereditary disorders or injuries. For example, head injuries can interfere with the normal functioning of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Tumors (both malignant and benign) and inflammatory processes that cause other diseases are dangerous for the endocrine glands. If the inflammatory process begins near an endocrine gland, it can affect its function. In addition, the activity of the endocrine glands can be affected by a lack or excess of certain substances in the diet. An example of the fact that diseases of the endocrine system can occur for a variety of reasons is a violation of the thyroid gland. Thus, its hypofunction can develop as a result of infectious diseases, surgical operations on the thyroid gland, and disorders of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. A lack of iodine in food is very dangerous for humans. Iodine is a component of hormones synthesized by the thyroid gland. If it does not enter the body in the required amount, hormones are not synthesized and signs of hypofunction of the gland appear. Hyperfunction of the thyroid gland can also occur for a large number of reasons. These include tumors of the thyroid gland itself


,


tumors of the pituitary gland, and taking a large number of drugs that
contain hormones of this gland. Excessive iodine in food or medications also provokes the development of hyperfunction.


StressStress is a non-specific neurohumoral response of the body to a very strong external influence. It occurs when factors that disrupt homeostasis act on the body. The main function of stress is the adaptation of the body to changed conditions, its adaptation to a specific situation.


Stages of stressThere are three stages of stress: the stage of anxiety, the stage of resistance, and the stage of exhaustion. In the stage of anxiety, the body feels that a situation has arisen that may threaten it in some way. It begins to look for ways out of such a situation (for example, a person has fallen into the water and is trying to find out how best to swim to the shore). At the same time, the body's ability to resist external influences first decreases slightly, and then begins to increase. In the stage of resistance, due to the mobilization of the body's resources under the influence of the nervous and humoral systems, its ability to resist increases. This stage is the most successful for overcoming a crisis (saving his life, a person can swim much further than under normal circumstances). However, if the body fails to solve the problems and begins to feel a lack of resources, the third stage comes - the stage of exhaustion. At this stage, the body's ability to resist decreases (if there is not enough strength, you can drown).


Types of stress There are physiological and psycho-emotional stress. Physiological stress occurs under the influence of noise, vibration, natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, etc.), climate change. The reason for its development

is the direct impact of some factor on the human body. For example, in the event of an earthquake, a person must leave a building as quickly as possible, and the body's stressful state allows him to run much faster than he can under normal circumstances. Psycho-emotional stress arises as a result of a person's emotional perception of a certain situation. It significantly depends on the characteristics of a person's character and his perception of a particular situation. For example, sports fans may perceive the loss of their favorite team in different ways. Some of them will simply have a bad mood, while others may take the defeat too seriously and psycho-emotional stress will lead to a deterioration in their health and, for example, a heart attack.


Reduced thyroid function often occurs as a result of a lack of
iodine compounds in food products. This element is part of the hormone produced by this gland. Therefore, it is recommended to use iodized salt to prevent such a disease.


The work of the glands of the humoral system, even with minor violations, leads to serious consequences for the body. Insufficient intensity of the glands of the endocrine system is called hypofunction, and excessive - hyperfunction. In the case of the action of strong factors on the body that disrupt homeostasis, stress occurs - a special non-specific neurohumoral response of the body..Topic 10


Immune system. Immunity


53


Before moving on to the study of the human immune system, remember which systems regulate the work of human organs. How does the endocrine system work? How does the nervous system carry out regulatory processes?


Immunity and immune reactions of the bodyImmunity is the ability of the body to protect its own integrity and biological individuality. It has to be protected both from foreign organisms that can cause diseases, and from its own cells (for example, cancer cells), in which negative changes have occurred. The main way the body protects itself is through immune reactions. An immune reaction (immune response) is a set of processes in the body that occur in response to the appearance of foreign biological
molecules - antigens. Antigens can be large
organic molecules, such as proteins and carbohydrates. The immune system carries out the immune response, which recognizes antigens and neutralizes them.


Cellular and humoral immunity The human body can neutralize antigens in two ways - with the help of special cells (cellular immunity) and with the help of special substances (humoral immunity). Although in both of these cases, certain types of white blood cells - T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes - are responsible for immune reactions. Cellular immunity is provided by T-lymphocytes, which have receptors on the surface of their membranes that can recognize a certain antigen. In case of interaction with the corresponding antigen, T-lymphocytes begin to multiply intensively, forming a large number of cells that destroy microorganisms that carry this antigen. Humoral immunity is provided by B-lymphocytes, which also contain receptors capable of recognizing a certain antigen. To destroy the corresponding antigen, B-lymphocytes, like T-lymphocytes, multiply intensively, forming a multitude of cells that synthesize special proteins - antibodies, specific for this antigen. By binding to antigens contained on the surface of microorganisms, antibodies

accelerate their capture and destruction by specialized leukocytes - phagocytes. This process is called
phagocytosis. In case of interaction with
molecules dangerous to the body (for example, diphtheria toxin), antibodies neutralize them.

Immune system and its organs The immune system includes such organs as the thymus, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. The spleen (Fig. 53.1) is the largest organ of the immune system. It actively produces leukocytes and participates in the neutralization of microorganisms and dangerous substances in the blood that passes through it. The bone marrow
is also an important center for the formation of leukocytes
. The thymus is an endocrine gland that works very actively in people at a young age, and then reduces its activity (Fig. 53.2). It is where T-lymphocytes mature and "learn", which then acquire the ability to recognize certain antigens. Tonsils are important structures that recognize microorganisms that enter the human body through the mouth and nose and begin to fight them. Lymph nodes are formed at the confluence of several lymphatic vessels and are a barrier to the spread of infections in the body. The main cells of the immune system are leukocytes (Fig. 53.3). Characteristic properties of leukocytes: diameter - varies significantly; number in 1 mm 3 - 4000â€“9000 pieces;

shape - amoeboid; cell nucleus - is; Place of formation: red bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen; Place of destruction: liver, lymph nodes, spleen; Life span: from several days to several decades. Types of immunity By origin, immunity is divided into natural and artificial. Natural immunity arises without the active participation of a person, and artificial immunity is the result of the work of doctors. In both of these cases, active and passive immunity can be distinguished. To learn more about the types of immunity, see the table.


Types of immunity


Type of immunity Brief description


Natural passive immunity


Occurs during the transfer of formed antibodies from one person to another.
In this way, antibodies are transferred from the mother to the fetus
(through the placenta) or the infant (through colostrum). This type of immunity provides short-term protection against infection


184. Immune system. Immunity


End of table


Type of immunity Brief description


Artificial passive immunity


It is created artificially, by injecting ready-made antibodies from one person to another. Most often, serum isolated from animal blood is used to provide such immunity. For example, to obtain serum from snake bites, horses are injected with very small doses of this poison. Their body produces the corresponding antibodies, which are then isolated from the blood plasma of horses and the necessary preparations are made from them. This type of immunity provides short-term protection against infection


Natural active immunity


Occurs as a result of a previous disease. In this case, the body produces its own antibodies, which persist throughout life and provide a faster response of the body in case of re-infection.
For example, if you had measles as a child, you are unlikely to be able
to catch this disease again. This type of immunity provides protection against infection for a long time


Artificial active immunity (Fig. 53.4)


Is created artificially by introducing small amounts of antigens into the body in the form of a vaccine - a killed or weakened pathogen of the disease. In this case, the body produces its own antibodies, which, depending on the disease, persist for a long time or even for life. This type of immunity provides protection against infection for a long time


The first effective vaccination was invented by the English doctor E. Jenner, who in 1796 found out that infection with cowpox protects a person from infection with a very dangerous natural smallpox.


The phenomenon of cellular immunity was discovered by I. Mechnikov, and humoral immunity by P. Ehrlich. For these discoveries, scientists received the Nobel Prize (1908).


Immunity is the ability of the body to protect its own integrity and biological individuality. This protection is carried out with the help of immune reactions by the organs and cells of the immune system. The organs of the immune system include the thymus, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. By origin, immunity can be natural or artificial, and by mechanism of action - cellular or humoral..TOPIC 10


Immune system disorders


54


Before moving on to the study of immune system disorders, remember what immunity is. What functions does the immune system perform? What glands are part of it? What other organ systems regulate the course of processes in the human body?


Consequences of an excessive immune system reaction As with humoral regulation disorders, even minor deviations in the immune system can lead to serious consequences. An excessively strong immune system response leads to the development of allergies. Allergy is a form of immunological response, manifested in the body's increased sensitivity to various allergens. Allergens are antigens that cause allergic reactions in the body (Fig. 54.1). They can be different for different people. This can be plant pollen, animal hair, dust, certain medications or household chemicals, etc. In the case of an allergy, the body responds to a specific allergen with an increased reaction that affects its own cells and tissues. Such a reaction can be swelling or inflammation, spasm of smooth muscles, impaired blood circulation. Very dangerous disorders of the immune system are autoimmune diseases. They occur when the body's immune system begins to perceive some of its own cells as foreign. Accordingly, this causes an immune response, which leads to the destruction and death of cells and tissues.


Consequences of an insufficient immune system response Insufficient activity of the immune system is also dangerous to health. If the immune system works poorly, that is, there is


a Figure 54.1. The most common food allergens


186.impairment of the immune system


immunodeficiency, the body becomes vulnerable even to those microorganisms that are normally not pathogenic. There are many reasons for a decrease in the effectiveness of the immune system. Factors that cause immune suppression: radiation exposure; difficult working conditions; hereditary disorders; severe stress; malnutrition; vitamin deficiency. exposure to harmful chemicals; One of the causes of immune suppression is AIDS. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which affects the cells of the immune system. Thus, by destroying the human immune system, the virus does not give it the opportunity to form an immune response to protect the body. In addition, the failure of the immune system leads to a situation where the body cannot resist other pathogens of infectious diseases. But not only HIV can suppress immunity. Diseases such as rubella, hepatitis, tuberculosis have a negative effect on the immune system. Although their impact is less than that of HIV, the risk of developing complications after these diseases is high.


HIV comes from the monkey immunodeficiency virus. Most likely, it came to humans in the 1920s in Africa. The source of infection could be the meat of monkeys, which are the object of hunting by local residents.


Increased work of the human immune system leads
to the development of allergies. Allergy is a form of immunological
response, which manifests itself in the increased sensitivity of the body to various allergens. Insufficient work of the immune system causes the development of immunodeficiency. In the case of immunodeficiency, the human body can be affected even by microorganisms that do not normally cause disease. Summary on the topic "Regulation of body functions"
