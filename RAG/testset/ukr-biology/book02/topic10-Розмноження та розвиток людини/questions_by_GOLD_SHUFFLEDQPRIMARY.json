We don&#39;t have the permission of the Libyan government, we don&#39;t have the permission of the UN Security Council, so the admiral is operating in that area, but he can&#39;t fight the smugglers on Libyan territory. So what is he doing? He says here that I have destroyed 551 ships and detained 151 migrants. But he will first save the ship and they are not random castaways, according to maritime law. They go there on purpose, yes. And by the way, there are still those non-profit ships waiting there that send signals: come, come, we are waiting. So they have to transport them to the port, the migrants are excited, within two hours, they have already tried it. They will say, well, that&#39;s the smuggler, he was on the ship with us. The smugglers then go to prison and then they destroy the ship. So this is really not like a systemic solution. There&#39;s a mafia here, they only trade in people and even oil and so on.\nSECTION C: And I would like to show the audience that I made a contract with them here before the elections, in October 2017, and I am fulfilling those points. I pledged that we would never allow illegal migrants into our territory and that we would never agree to the distribution of migrants according to mandatory quotas. I fulfilled that in six months, we enforced that, yes.\nSECTION D: ...and I discussed it with him (Wolfgang Schäuble - note: Demagogue) and he always understood us, he saw it at the press conference and said yes, here is the Czech Republic, and the V4 have a different history, they don&#39;t have the multicultural model and we don&#39;t want it, because the foreigners haven&#39;t been integrated in the individual states. \nSECTION E: And then there is Libya. That is the biggest problem. There is not actually one government there, there are elections coming up, the Libyan guard, which we helped as part of Operation Sofia, is very effective. It is holding the ships, 84% and they didn&#39;t have oil in August. So Prime Minister Conte was dealing with oil, because it is a state-owned company, but the government was not able to force them to give the Libyan guard oil so that they could hold the ships.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p><a href=\"http://www.korupce.cz/cz/o-nas/o-nas-104793/\">The Department for Combating Corruption</a> is an organizational unit of the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic. The activities of this department must be in accordance with the Statute and Rules of Procedure of the Government Council for the Coordination of the Fight against Corruption. The Council was established by <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/PJUA9NDCLZA9\">a government resolution</a> of 30 July 2017.</p><p> Ivan Bartoš mentions <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=10700\">the Working Group for the Assessment of Legislation on Anti-Corruption Measures</a> . It was founded by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Radek Vondráček (ANO). The aim of this <a href=\"https://www.rekonstrukcestatu.cz/cs/archiv-novinek/12067-poslanci-vytvorili-novou-pracovni-skupinu-proti-korupci\">group</a> is to find consensus in the approval of anti-corruption laws by means of discussion forums for members of political parties, non-profit organizations, and the public. Those interested in discussing drafts of current laws should meet approximately once a month, and the first meeting, held on February 1, 2018, was attended by representatives of several political parties.</p><p> There is no mention in the public media space of the existence of the aforementioned version, which would allow for, for example, an information embargo.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>The government <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134598\">proposal</a> (.pdf) for an amendment to Act No. <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1999-106\">106/1999 Coll.</a> , on free access to information, adds the following sentence to Section 2: <em>&quot;The Act shall not apply to the provision of information on ongoing criminal proceedings and persons participating in them, with the exception of information on court decisions on the merits.&quot;</em> (.pdf, p. 28).<em> </em>The amendment to the Act would thus make it impossible to access information on ongoing criminal proceedings under Act No. 106/1999 Coll., including procedural decisions in the proceedings. Therefore, if a question were asked, it would be completely outside the competence of the Act and there would be no need to handle it.</p><p> In the current version of the Act on Free Access to Information <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1999-106#p11-4-a\">, Section 11</a> already contains a ban on providing information on ongoing criminal proceedings (i.e. everything up to the decision in the case). The law therefore required that the request be processed in such a way that the information is not provided. However, this rule is broken by the case law ( <a href=\"http://sbirka.nssoud.cz/cz/svobodny-pristup-k-informacim-informace-o-probihajicim-trestnim-rizeni.p2162.html\">judgment</a> no. 1 As 44/2010 – 103, point 36) of the Supreme Administrative Court, which requires obliged entities to consider each individual case and, depending on the circumstances, to allow the provision of information on ongoing criminal proceedings where the failure to provide information cannot be justified by an “urgent social need”. Courts may therefore provide information on ongoing criminal proceedings despite the statutory ban, if the failure to provide information is not necessary.</p><p> According to <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134598\">the explanatory report</a> (.pdf, p. 127) of the government amendment, this situation led to &quot; <em>a far-reaching burden on criminal justice authorities, who always had to justify in detail why information could not be provided (if they did not provide it), with difficulties arising from the question of how to argue without using the information itself&quot;.</em><br/><br/> If the government amendment were to enter into force, the obligation of authorities involved in criminal proceedings to provide reasons for (not) providing information during the proceedings, as established by case law, would cease. Only the obligation to provide information on the decision on the merits would be maintained. The public would thus not have access to information on ongoing criminal proceedings and procedural decisions, which are often crucial for the development of the proceedings. According to <a href=\"http://sbirka.nssoud.cz/cz/svobodny-pristup-k-informacim-informace-o-probihajicim-trestnim-rizeni.p2162.html\">the NSS</a> (point 38), providing information on ongoing criminal proceedings is often in the public interest, especially in cases involving criminal acts committed by officials or public officials. Such a case is, among others, the procedural <a href=\"http://www.ceska-justice.cz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Rath_VS_171016.pdf\">resolution</a> of the High Court in Prague in the David Rath case, by which the High Court rejected wiretapping as illegal.<br/><br/> The discussion of the amendment to the law in the third reading was included on <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/ischuze.sqw?o=8&amp;s=20\">the agenda</a> of the 20th meeting and should take place on November 14, 2018.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Chairman Bartoš (Pirates) is referring to the amendment to the Civil Service Act. The amendment proposal was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=132\">submitted</a> by the government on March 26, 2018.</p><p> Documents that demonstrate the European Commission&#39;s critical stance on the amendment were published on June 7, 2018 by <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj\">the iRozhlas.cz</a> server. Specifically, it is <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf\">a letter</a> (.pdf) addressed to the Deputy Minister of the Interior for the Civil Service, <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/vedeni-ministerstva-260932.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Mg%3D%3D\">Josef Postránecký</a> . The letter states that, based on a meeting on March 20, 2018, both parties reached a consensus on the need for further amendments to the draft Civil Service Act. The first part of the letter summarizes the commission&#39;s conclusions from the Report on the Czech Republic 2018 ( <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/2018-european-semester-country-report-czech-republic-en.pdf\">.pdf, p. 37</a> ). The criticism was directed at the administrative burden resulting from the proposal, the inability to attract experts from the academic and private sectors. The letter also mentions a large number of dismissals in leading positions after the new government took office, which does not correspond to the desired depoliticization of the state administration ( <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf\">.pdf, p. 1</a> ).</p><p> This part of the letter is crucial: &quot; <em>We therefore remain concerned about key elements of the proposal. For example, the shift to somewhat lower requirements for second rounds of selection procedures for management positions, the possibility of dismissing managers based on</em> a &#39; <em>sufficient</em> &#39; <em>evaluation result, the possibility of dismissing civil servants based on two performance evaluations within a 40-day period, and the deprivation of managers from the possibility of filing an objection to performance evaluations.&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf\">.pdf, p. 2</a> - translation by <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj\">the iRozhlas.cz</a> server used).</p><p> The European Commission&#39;s criticism was directed at changes in the evaluation of civil servants&#39; work and the shortening of the period between individual evaluations.</p><p> The extension of the minimum period of 40 days between individual assessments to 60 days, or in the case of an extraordinary assessment after a previous assessment with an <em>unsatisfactory</em> result to 90 days, was presented in an amendment by Kateřina Valachová (ČSSD) ( <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138713\">docx, pp. 4 and 10</a> ). Her amendment was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=68390\">adopted</a> .</p><p> Minister Dostálová (ANO) submitted an amendment to Section 60, paragraph 3 ( <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138717\">.docx, page 1</a> ):</p><p> <em>&quot;X. In Section 60, paragraph 3, first and second sentences, the words &quot;, State Secretary&quot; are inserted after the words &quot;Deputy for Civil Service&quot;.<br/><br/> X. In Section 60, the following sentence is added at the end of paragraph 3: &quot;A proposal to dismiss the Deputy for Civil Service and the Human Resources Director of the Civil Service Section shall be submitted to the Government by the Minister of the Interior, a proposal to dismiss the State Secretary shall be submitted to the Government by the relevant minister or the head of the Government Office after discussion with the Deputy for Civil Service.&quot;</em></p><p> According to Dostálová&#39;s amendment, the dismissal of state secretaries is therefore possible based on a government decision following the recommendation of the minister, as Bartoš states in his statement.</p><p> The expansion of the scale and conditions of personal evaluation was regulated by the proposal in Section 155 (. <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134549\">pdf, p. 24</a> ), among other things, it planned to expand the evaluation scale from 4 to 5 categories:</p><p> , <em>,3) The performance evaluation must contain a conclusion on whether the civil servant achieved in the service</em></p><p> <em>a) excellent results,</em></p><p> <em>b) very good results,</em></p><p> c <em>) good results,</em></p><p> d <em>) satisfactory results, or</em></p><p> (e <em>) unsatisfactory results.”</em></p><p> The proposal therefore implies that the evaluation scale has been expanded. To terminate the employment relationship, it is &quot;enough&quot; to obtain a rating of d) and e), in the words of Chairman Bartoš, &quot; <em>a five or a four&quot;.<br/></em><br/> The initial wording of the draft amendment regulated the conditions for dismissal from service in Section 60, Article 1, Part b): &quot; <em>the service evaluation contains a conclusion that the official achieved unsatisfactory or satisfactory results in service&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134549\">.pdf, p. 16</a> ). In this case, no <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138947\">amendment proposal</a> (.pdf) was submitted that would specifically change this provision. It can be said that the possibility of dismissing an official from service for a <em>satisfactory (&quot;four&quot;)</em> evaluation thus remained in the proposal, although (as of November 1, 2018) we cannot <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?o=8&amp;v=US&amp;ct=372&amp;fbclid=IwAR1xFaCcnQoQ8hlHnDguF5qbwVymlDT-FybJNQ7rJoXSGHSwBNBtEzdVrus\">confirm</a> this with the press, which the Senate should now have. The EC&#39;s reprimand in this case was not corrected by the amendments, and we therefore assess the statement of Chairman Bartoš as untrue.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Over the past few months, the opposition has clashed with supporters <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?t=509&amp;o=8\">of the government&#39;s tax package</a> in the Chamber of Deputies. For example, Miroslav Kalousek from TOP 09 described the new taxation of <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/opozice-opet-kritizovala-danovy-balicek-ministryne-ho-hajila/1801587\">insurance company reserves</a> as the most dangerous and harmful part of the package and proposed <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=162339\">to cancel</a> this change (.doc, p. 2). Miroslav Kalousek further claims that the tightening of conditions will motivate foreign owners of insurance companies in the Czech Republic to send dividends abroad.</p><p> Another criticized point of the law is the increase in the fee for <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2952944-zive-snemovna-mela-schvalovat-vladni-danovy-balicek\">registering a property in the cadastre</a> from the current 1,000 crowns to double it. MPs Věra Kovářová (STAN), Mikuláš Ferjenčík (Pirates) and Jan Bartošek (KDU-ČSL) <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/opozice-opet-kritizovala-danovy-balicek-ministryne-ho-hajila/1801587\">submitted</a> a joint <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=162386\">proposal</a> (.doc) in which they want to delete this part from the proposal.</p><p> The last of the opposition proposals mentioned in the statement is the attempt to abolish <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/opozice-opet-kritizovala-danovy-balicek-ministryne-ho-hajila/1801587\">the real estate acquisition tax</a> , which is being pursued <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=162092\">by the ODS</a> (.doc). <a href=\"https://www.lidovky.cz/domov/dan-z-nabyti-nemovitosti-se-bude-platit-dal-snemovna-odmitla-navrh-senatu-na-zruseni.A190924_203904_ln_domov_ele\">The Senate</a> attempted the same change, but it was also rejected. However, none of these proposals <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=168103\">were</a> (.doc, pp. 4–5, 9) adopted.</p><p> On the contrary, the Pirates&#39; amendments to improve conditions for <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=162409\">home brewing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=161936\">poker</a> players were <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=168103\">accepted</a> in the Chamber of Deputies (.doc, pp. 7, 9).</p><p></p>\nSECTION E: <p>The government <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=132\">submitted</a> a draft amendment to the Civil Service Act to the Chamber of Deputies on 26 March 2018. The amendment was approved by the Chamber of Deputies in the third reading. At the 19th meeting of the Chamber of Deputies on 13 September, the chairman of the Pirates, Ivan Bartoš, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/019schuz/s019100.htm\">questioned</a> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš about the amendment to the Civil Service Act. The Pirates criticize the amendment on the grounds that, according to them, it strengthens political influence in the state administration and may increase the risk of dismissing inconvenient civil servants.</p><p> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš stated in his response to the interpellation: <em>&quot;So you are creating an atmosphere here that we have been doing some kind of purge. When you are not in it and you are a minister and you have a state secretary who does whatever he wants, does not go to work, is antisocial, threatens a mother who has a home office, and we have one like that, a state secretary. And when you have a subordinate who is not working well, who has caused damage, then try to explain to me how we should replace him. And we have been fighting this for a long time.&quot;</em></p><p> He continued: <em>&quot;It is absurd for the minister to be there in the number, for the state secretary to actually do whatever he wants. So that he cannot de facto, if he is dissatisfied with a direct subordinate, so that he cannot replace him. So try talking to Adam Vojtěch, he has probably been in charge there since February. He asked for some disciplinary proceedings and now we are waiting for the highest official. Because the highest official, Mr. Postránecký, is more than the government. More! That is absolutely top!&quot;</em></p><p> The Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013059.htm\">commented</a> on the amendment to the Civil Service Act at the 13th meeting of the Chamber of Deputies on May 23, 2018, where he stated: <em>&quot;I am appearing before you on behalf of a ministry that has long been affected by the highest staff shortage of all central state administration bodies in the Czech Republic. In 2016, it was 65%, the occupancy rate in the ministry. In 2017, I took over the Ministry of Health in a situation where every third employee was missing, when some departments had only department heads without rank-and-file employees. In this complicated situation, I was supposed to fulfill a program, which, however, was slowly becoming impossible to implement with anyone. And unfortunately, it is not possible to this day. When I was looking for the cause of these problems after I took office at the ministry, I conducted a questionnaire among employees, a relatively extensive questionnaire survey, in which over 80% of employees participated. And I am deeply convinced that the main reason for this catastrophic situation in the healthcare sector is the long-term inability to effectively staff manage employees from the highest position in the ministry, i.e. from the position of State Secretary.&quot;</em> He further stated: <em>&quot;I filed a disciplinary complaint against the State Secretary on February 12. The disciplinary committee has not even met to date</em> - <em>and I say again that we are facing a fundamental personnel destabilization and personnel shortage at the Ministry of Health. I therefore believe that disciplinary proceedings are not a completely appropriate tool for resolving the unsystematic, purposeful and often irrational behavior of responsible persons.&quot;</em> He also mentioned in his speech the case where the State Secretary at the Ministry of Health illegally delayed the selection process for the position of Director of the State Institute for Drug Control.</p><p> It is therefore clear from the quotes that both are complaining about the protracted disciplinary proceedings and the impossibility of immediately implementing a change. They are not saying – as Bartoš suggests in his statement – that a change cannot be implemented at all, on the contrary, they are trying to achieve change through specific steps (disciplinary proceedings).</p><p> Let us add that, according to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-234?text=§60#f5357312\">Section 60</a> of the Civil Service Act, a state secretary can only be dismissed in cases defined by law (e.g., termination of service, medical incapacity, etc.). In addition, this is possible if &quot; <em>the service evaluation contains a conclusion that he achieved unsatisfactory results in service&quot;.</em> However, such <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/sluzba/clanek/sluzebni-hodnoceni.aspx\">a service evaluation</a> is done once a year and if it is unsatisfactory, a new one is done in 6 months. If he reaches the fourth level of evaluation twice, i.e. &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, he can be dismissed, which is also <a href=\"https://www.mkcr.cz/stanovisko-k-80-zakona-o-statni-sluzbe-163.html\">explained</a> in his opinion by the &quot;super-official&quot; Postránecký. Thus, the dismissal process takes at least a year and a half.</p><p> According to Section 60, paragraph 4 of this Act, service also ends on the day the decision on disciplinary action in the form of dismissal or dismissal becomes legally binding. However, it must be taken into account that, according to the Administrative Code, it is possible <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p81-1\">to appeal</a> against the decision of the first-instance disciplinary committee to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-234/zneni-20170801?porov=20170701#p93-1\">the second-instance</a> disciplinary committee, and only then does the decision become legally binding.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>Bartoš is probably referring to Babiš&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2017-cr/andrej-babis-i/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-13-12-2017-27-06-2018-166989/\">first</a> minority government from December 2017 to July 2018, which did not gain <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/premier-andrej-babis-neduvera-poslanecka-snemovna-mensinova-vlada-demise-hnuti_1801161555_haf\">the confidence</a> of the Chamber of Deputies. Its draft amendment to the Civil Service Act was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=132\">submitted</a> to the Chamber on March 26, 2018, i.e. 2 months after submitting his resignation.</p><p> Given the terminology (&quot;the first thing the government started to address&quot;), it is more of a figure of speech than a factual statement that it should be the first law submitted. However, it is worth adding that this was not the first government bill since taking <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/prezident-milos-zeman-jmenoval-vladu-premiera-andreje-babise-162087/\">office</a> . Between December 13, 2017 and March 26, 2018, the government submitted an amendment <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=46\">to the Act</a> on the CNB, an amendment to <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=56\">the Act</a> on the Transfer of Ownership, an amendment <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=90\">to the Act</a> on the Organization and Implementation of Social Security, or <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=120\">an amendment</a> to the Act on Pension Insurance. Even the Ministry of the Interior, as the representative of the proposer, did not submit an amendment to the Act on Civil Service as the first part of its agenda; it was preceded, for example, by an amendment <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=59\">to the Act</a> on Elections to the Parliament of the Czech Republic.<br/><br/> In April 2018, the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj\">criticized</a> the government&#39;s draft amendment to the Civil Service Act. As we read in a letter from European Commissioner for Employment Marianne Thyssen<em> </em>to the Deputy Minister of the Interior for the Civil Service, Josef Postránecký: &quot; <em>We therefore remain concerned about key elements of the proposal.
