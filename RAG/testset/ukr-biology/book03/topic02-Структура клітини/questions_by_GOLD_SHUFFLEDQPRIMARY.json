No, strengthening it. We won the Senate elections by a landslide.\nSECTION C: And as Prime Minister, I think, on December 22nd, I sent a letter on behalf of the Czech Republic to the President of the European Commission, where I say: our government considers the core to be extremely important, I ask you to take this into account when making decisions, and here I am attaching the decision of our Parliament, which shows that this is what the Czech Republic wants across the political spectrum.\nSECTION D: Well, for the same reason that debates about the global pact are taking place in most European countries today.

If you look at the statements of all the leading representatives of European countries, including Germany, including the Netherlands, not to mention Austria, they all say no, this time we cannot accept any migration wave.\nSECTION F: I set a goal for us (ODS, note: Demagog.cz) to always have 50% more in every election in the same type of election, which is no small ambition, we are doing well, in the last European elections we even exceeded that, when I look at the last elections that were held here, municipal, senate, we significantly strengthened, we clearly won in the senate elections, when I look at the European elections, we were second, we doubled the number of mandates, we tripled the number of votes. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

This is only apparent from his answers, which contain expressions such as &quot; <i>generally speaking, I can note for the KSČM...&quot;</i> etc.</p><p> The newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/o-gazete/\">has been published</a> since 2018 with the subtitle Newspaper of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and was previously also the central press organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense. It is therefore possible to describe it as a military newspaper, as Vít Rakušan states. His description of this periodical as a magazine is somewhat more problematic, as the aforementioned subtitle already suggests, Krasnaya Zvezda describes itself as a newspaper. Despite this minor discrepancy, however, we generally assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Vít Rakušan is talking here about the statement of the chairman of the KSČM, Vojtěch Filip, who, in <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/vojteh-filip-bolshinstvo-grazhdan-cheshskoj-respubliki-vot-uzhe-75-let-ispytyvayut-chuvstvo-blagodarnosti-k-krasnoj-armii-2/\">an interview</a> published on May 15, 2020 by the Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, stated:</p><p> <i>“(…) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [is] departing from the national position when it criticizes the Russian Federation for not yet restoring war memorials on its territory to the fallen Czechoslovak legionnaires who fought in Samara, near Lipiag near Novokuybyshev and in other places in Russia with Russian revolutionary communists in 1918.</i></p><p> <i>Members of the KSČM and other citizens of the Czech Republic positively perceive the fact that the Russian government does not show interest in forcing local authorities to build monuments to those Czech legionnaires who did not liberate anyone in Russia and did nothing good for the most brilliant world socialist revolution of the last century in 1917 in Russia.”</i></p><p> The mentioned legionnaires who fought in <a href=\"http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:b5c8164d-afea-4a70-b22a-624680b5fdef?page=uuid:88aa7912-10f7-11e8-b8ac-005056b73ae5\">Samara</a> on the Volga in June 1918 (PLESKÝ, Metoděj. <i>4th Regiment of Prokop the Great</i> . 1936, p. 219) and at the Lipjagi station in the nearby city of Novokuybyshevsk (ibid., pp. 202–203) are soldiers of the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý and <a href=\"http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/dsmo/view/uuid:dde50707-6b59-4eef-a3d6-916586657465?page=uuid:cefb781e-0fc9-11e8-ad37-005056b73ae5&amp;fulltext=samara\">the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi</a> (LANGER, František. <i>Memorial Book of the 1st Rifle Regiment of Jan Husi.</i> 1920, p. 44). They defeated the Bolshevik troops here, with whom they came into conflict mainly because the Russian side did not comply with the agreement on the departure of the Czechoslovak legionnaires via Vladivostok to France. Tomáš Jakl, a historian at the Military Historical Institute, <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/co-se-odehravalo-behem-velke-valky-na-vychodni-fronte/\">states</a> :</p><p> <i>&quot;However, at the end of April 1918, the transportation of Czechoslovak transports practically stopped due to pressure from Germany. In addition, at the end of May, the Soviet government attempted to completely disarm the Czechoslovak corps and transfer the Czechoslovaks either to the Red Army or to labor units. The Czechoslovak soldiers responded to this attempt by deciding to leave for Vladivostok on their own.&quot;</i></p><p> Before the beginning of the conflicts with the Bolsheviks, these Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia had already achieved a number of military successes in battles with the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. In March 1918, for example, the 4th Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Prokop Holý took part in the Battle of <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/exhibit/ruske-legie-v-bitve-u-bachmace-1918/\">Bachmač</a> , where an important railway junction was located. And above all, the soldiers of the 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of Master Jan Husi fought victoriously at <a href=\"http://www.vhu.cz/zborov-bitva-ktera-cs-vojakum-vydobyla-respekt/\">Zborov</a> in early July 1917.</p><p> Currently, both cities are located in Ukraine, and at the time of the fighting, Bachmač was part of the independent <a href=\"http://www.haidamaka.org.ua/obr/sxslob/mapaunr.jpg\">Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic</a> and Zborov was part of <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Europe_1918.jpg\">the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</a> However, it is important to mention that, for example, Bachmač was still part of <a href=\"https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/map-russian-empire-1914\">the Russian Empire</a> at the beginning of World War I. Let us add that at Zborov, the entire Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade was directly subordinated to the Russian <a href=\"https://kramerius.army.cz/search/i.jsp?pid=uuid:0fee9338-6380-4fab-8551-ecef91c582d5&amp;q=&amp;fq=document_type:%22monograph%22&amp;fq=keywords:%221.%20%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A1%20d%C4%9Blost%C5%99eleck%C3%A1%20brig%C3%A1da%22#monograph-page_uuid:51ea50b3-0fc3-11e8-927a-005056b73ae5\">49th Army Corps</a> (KAVENA, Karel. <i>History of the 1st Artillery Regiment of Jan Žižka of Trocnov in the Russian Revolution and in the Fatherland</i> . 1937, p. 44). It is also an indisputable fact that the 4th and 1st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiments, with their work (along with many others), helped Russia to achieve final victory on the Eastern European battlefield.</p><p> According to historians, the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian army near the town of Zborov also <a href=\"https://books.google.cz/books?id=li-2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=v%C3%BDznam+zborova+samostatn%C3%A9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkOxi0hmPp&amp;sig=ACfU3U2orK3G_vX83GzgA2tpeU7ffHK1ew&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiv3P358sfpAhXJ8OAKHZvtAqQQ6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%C4%8Deskoslovensk%C3%A9%20st%C3%A1tn%C3%AD%20samostatnosti&amp;f=false\">played</a> (MOJŽÍŠ, Milan, RAK, Michal et al. <i>Zborov 1917–2017</i> . 2019, p. 150) along with other combat actions of Czechoslovak legionnaires in Russia a very <a href=\"http://www.acr.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=11914\">important role</a> in political negotiations on the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak Republic. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Zborov in 2017, for example, the Chamber of Deputies adopted <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=10179\">a resolution</a> that ends with the words: <i>&quot;The deeds of the legionnaires should never be forgotten. The heroes of Zborov have contributed to the state.&quot;</i></p><p> For these reasons, Vojtěch Filip&#39;s statement can to some extent be considered as questioning the historical role of these units, as Vít Rakušan states in the statement. However, it is clear from the statement that Vojtěch Filip directly questioned the role of the legionnaires in the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia. Filip spoke only about their importance for Russia and the revolution in Russia. Rakušan thus presents Filip&#39;s statement in a misleading context.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Vít Rakušan <a href=\"https://www.vitrakusan.cz/zivotopis/\">studied</a> history, German studies, and school management.

This happened after General Vlasov <a href=\"https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach\">was captured</a> by the Germans during the defense of Leningrad. The ROA <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/veda-technologie/historie/ustr-historik-historie-osvobozeni-cesko-rusko-vlasovci_1912141111_hag\">members</a> included Soviet prisoners of war and the so-called white emigration, or people who left the USSR in the 1920s and decided to fight against Stalin. Their main <a href=\"https://www.valka.cz/651-Vlasovci-v-Cechach\">goal</a> was to defeat Stalin. Germany was to help them achieve these goals. On the side of Nazi Germany, <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">they fought</a> against the USSR in the area between the Oder and the Neisse.</p><p> However, in the spring of 1945, it became <a href=\"https://plus.rozhlas.cz/vlasovci-vojaci-mezi-dvema-totalitami-8203473\">clear</a> to Vlasov (audio, time from 15:30) that he could not count on Germany&#39;s help in the long-term fight against Stalin. On the contrary, the Germans were rather using Vlasov&#39;s army for their own purposes. For this reason, he decided to leave Germany with his army for Linz. In an attempt to win the favor of the Allied (or American) troops, he then decided, together with General Bunyachenko, to help liberate Prague.</p><p> <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/zradci-a-vrazi-nebo-zneuznani-osvoboditele-diskuze-o-vyznamu-kontroverznich-8121440\">They arrived</a> in Prague on May 5, 1945.

During his regular <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2SwQpWtZTQE?t=332\">weekend report</a> (video) on his YouTube channel, Andrej Babiš read information about the financing of the health sector from a piece of paper on which an e-mail addressed to the Prime Minister from the Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, was printed on the other side. Minister Vojtěch sent the message to the Prime Minister&#39;s private e-mail address, who then forwarded it to an employee of the IMOBA company, who printed it for him.</p><p> <a href=\"https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vysledky?subjektId=713630&amp;typ=PLATNY\">IMOBA</a> is a member of the SynBiol concern, which is part of Andrej Babiš&#39;s <a href=\"https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66371830-kdo-je-kdo-ve-sverenskych-fondech-pres-ktere-podle-expertu-babis-dal-ovlada-agrofert-dulezite-funkce-maji-premierovi-pravnici-i-manzelka\">trust fund</a> called AB private trust I. The video also shows that Prime Minister Babiš uses his personal address with the domain &quot;e-babis.cz&quot; for government email communication. In response to the video, a wave of criticism arose, firstly, regarding the Prime Minister&#39;s continuing ties to his former trust companies and secondly, due to the way the Prime Minister operates with potentially sensitive government information on unsecured email addresses.</p><p> The 37th meeting of the House Committee on Security took place on May 14. According to its <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173747&amp;pdf=1\">invitation</a> (.pdf), the deputies were to discuss the 5th item <i>&quot;Securing government materials when using private e-mail addresses by the Prime Minister and members of the government&quot;.</i> This item was proposed by Vít Rakušan, and the head of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security Karel Řehka was also invited to comment.

Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>On September 17, 2019, an interview with Radka Maxová was published on the website <a href=\"https://denikn.cz/198131/na-socialni-sluzby-penize-nejsou-ale-nasla-se-miliarda-na-kurovce-rika-maxova-v-ano-zustava-kvuli-pracovitym-lidem/\">denikn.cz</a> , where she was asked, among other things, about her opinion on the suspension of the prosecution of Andrej Babiš. We were unable to find any other media outlets discussing this topic with MEP Maxová.</p><p> The <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/OJ-9-2019-09-16-SYN_CS.html\">Strasbourg</a> meeting took place from 16 to 19 September, and on none of the days was there any topic related to Andrej Babiš on the agenda. As for the <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/EMPL-PV-2019-09-24-1_EN.pdf\">Brussels</a> meeting, on 24 September there was a meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which Radka Maxová probably has in mind. The minutes also do not mention the discussion of the topic of Prime Minister Babiš and the suspension of his criminal prosecution.</p>\nSECTION B: <p><a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-intergroup-european-parliament\">The Disability Intergroup</a> is an informal group of Members of the European Parliament interested in supporting people with disabilities and their rights. This “intergroup” is one of the oldest, first established in 1980.</p><p> After the last elections to the European Parliament, an initiative was taken <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/newsroom/news/european-disability-movement-calls-reestablishment-disability-intergroup-european\">to revive</a> this group in the new composition of the Parliament. The exact sequence of events and negotiations between the EU Disability Forum (EDF, an umbrella organization that helps people with disabilities) and the MEPs is not available, but Radka Maxová, who attended the negotiations and supports the establishment of the group, can also be considered the initiator of the establishment of the Disability Intergroup in the European Parliament.</p><p> If Maxová is talking in her statement about the MPs she managed to recruit for this group, or about the date of the group&#39;s establishment, then we were unable to verify these parts of the statement from public sources. Information about the negotiations on the group is only provided by posts on the social networks of MEP Maxová and EDF. Only the following two posts mention the creation of the aforementioned Disability Intergroup: </p><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fradka.maxova.1%2Fposts%2F2417964951767893&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"584\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FEuropeanDisabilityForumEDF%2Fposts%2F2545439382145973&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"830\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div><p> The contributions prove the meetings of MEPs (including Maxová) with EDF, the content of which is the planned creation of the Disability Intergroup.</p><p> Information on the current number of signatures and representation of all committees is not publicly available anywhere. The group&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-intergroup-european-parliament\">website</a> only provides <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/sites/default/files/disability_intergroup-mep_support_form_0.pdf\">a form</a> (.pdf) for MEPs to express their support for the group&#39;s establishment for the years 2019–2024. The same website also provides <a href=\"http://www.edf-feph.org/sites/default/files/disability_intergroup_meps_list_-_update_october_2018.xls\">a list</a> (.xls) of the group&#39;s supporters, but this is for the previous period (2014–2019), not the one currently being negotiated.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>Let us begin by stating that <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koalicni-smlouva-vlada-andreje-babise-hnuti-ano-cssd-jan-hamacek-zimola_1805150600_kno\">the coalition agreement</a> signed between ANO and ČSSD contains the general principles of the coalition&#39;s functioning. The individual priorities and goals are then described in the government&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/jednani-vlady/programove-prohlaseni/programove-prohlaseni-vlady-165960/\">program statement</a> , to which the coalition agreement refers. It states the government&#39;s commitment &quot; <em>We will increase the parental allowance to CZK 300,000.&quot;</em> It currently (per child) is <a href=\"https://portal.mpsv.cz/soc/ssp/obcane/rodicovsky_prisp\">CZK 220,000</a> . From 2020, preparations are underway to increase the parental allowance to the aforementioned <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2916452-rodicovska-se-zrejme-vyrazne-zmeni-tak-jako-u-materske-davka-mohla-vychazet-z-vyse\">CZK 300,000</a> .</p><p> There was <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit\">agreement</a> across the political spectrum on increasing the parental allowance, however, there was disagreement on the key to increase the parental allowance and for whom. There were three options:</p><ol><li> Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Jana Maláčová (ČSSD) <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit\">proposed</a> that the increased benefit apply to all parents whose children will be under 4 years old as of January 1, 2020. This option would mean an increase in budget costs of CZK 11.2 billion.</li><li> Minister of Finance Alena Schillerová (ANO) <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2742299-rodicovsky-prispevek-ma-od-pristiho-roku-vzrust-o-80-tisic-kdo-na-nej-bude-mit\">proposed</a> that the increased benefit apply to all parents who would be actively receiving parental allowance as of January 1, 2020. This option would be more economical by CZK 2.6 billion compared to option 1 and would mean an increase in budget costs by CZK 8.6 billion.</li><li> Another option and compromise <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2768231-komu-se-zvysi-rodicovska-vladni-navrh-se-vraci-na-stul-ministryne-financi\">option</a> resulting from the coalition negotiations was the possibility of increasing the benefit for all parents whose child is born after January 1, 2020. This would represent a saving of approximately CZK 5.5 billion in the state budget compared to option 2 and an increase in budget costs of CZK 3 billion.</li></ol><p> In March, Minister Maláčová <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2764631-rust-rodicovske-a-duchodu-mohla-podporit-i-opozice-ne-ale-variantu-domluvenou-a\">announced</a> that the coalition partners had agreed to implement a third option, which was subsequently denied by both Prime Minister Babiš and MP Maxová, saying that the agreement between the parties was different.</p><p> The individual coalition parties then stood by their proposals (ČSSD for the first option, ANO for the second option) and exchanged messages with each other through the media (e.g. <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2812658-zakon-o-rodicovske-predlozi-cssd-uz-za-tyden-nechceme-aby-se-navyseni-nestihlo\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819351-novy-rozpocet-bude-mit-schodek-40-miliard-sektorova-dan-nebude-banky-ale-maji\">here</a> ). <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2769701-zive-o-kolik-se-zvednou-duchody-o-jejich-zvyseni-jednala-vlada\"></a> , who and where has the savings to find the money for the announced increases, because the state budget deficit has already been announced at <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819351-novy-rozpocet-bude-mit-schodek-40-miliard-sektorova-dan-nebude-banky-ale-maji\">CZK 40 billion</a> and it should not have been exceeded.</p><p> There was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2819144-rodicovska-na-programu-vlady-malacova-prichazi-s-kompromisem-potrebuje-osm-miliard\">an option</a> to divide the increase in the allowance: in the first half of 2019 there would be an increase of CZK 40,000, and by the end of the election period there would then be a planned full increase of another CZK 40,000. However, MP Maxová supported the option of a one-time increase: &quot; <em>I personally would probably prefer the option that children whose parents receive parental allowance receive it, and spread the 80,000 according to the length of time they have been drawing parental allowance.&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/pretahovani-o-rodicovskou-kdo-to-mysli-s-rodinami-lepe-malacova-nebo-babis-69733\">Duel Seznam Zprávy</a> , time 1:40)</p><p> The bill was finally submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/ALBSBCDM5SWO\">a second version</a> (.doc, page 8) with a one-time increase of CZK 80,000 and passed <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=490\">its second reading</a> in the Chamber of Deputies in September.</p><p> For the sake of completeness, let us add that MP Maxová was the chairwoman of the Social Policy Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic, but her <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2863985-zive-snemovna-resi-zvyseni-rodicovskeho-prispevku-i-oteviraci-dobu-obchodu\">mandate as a member of parliament expired</a> in July because she became an MEP, and she therefore no longer participated <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=70821\">in the vote</a> on the amendment to the law.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Representatives of the ANO movement are part of the Renew Europe (formerly ALDE) faction in the European Parliament. No internal communication regarding the European Parliament resolution on the conflict of interest of Andrej Babiš has been published. In general, the Renew Europe faction has not commented on this topic on its <a href=\"https://reneweuropegroup.eu/en/news/\">website</a> , <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RenewEurope/\">social networks</a> or otherwise. Of the total number of <a href=\"https://reneweuropegroup.eu/en/about-us/our-meps/\">98</a> MEPs in this faction, 72 MEPs voted for the entire resolution ( <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/PV-9-2020-06-19-RCV_FR.pdf\">.pdf, p. 316</a> ).</p><p> Only the statement of MEP and member of this faction Radka Maxová is available. In an interview with Seznam Zprávy, she <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/babisova-europoslankyne-resim-jestli-setrvani-v-ano-je-pro-me-jeste-unosne-109740\">stated</a> that she did not agree with voting on the resolution as a whole, and that it would be appropriate to vote on certain parts ( <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2020-0164_CS.html\">part A and paragraphs 11, 14, 20, 21, 49</a> ) separately.</p><p> Whether there were discussions within the faction about whether it would be appropriate to vote on certain parts separately and whether the faction supported this proposal cannot be verified due to the lack of sources. However, in the end it was indeed <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/cs/press-room/20200615IPR81227/parlament-zada-vysetreni-mozneho-stretu-zajmu-ceskeho-premiera\">a resolution</a> as a whole.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The proposal to increase parental allowance <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=490\">passed</a> its second reading in the Chamber of Deputies on 25 September 2019. It is intended <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=161461\">to increase</a> (.pdf, p. 2, point 4) parental allowance by 80 thousand, from 220 thousand to 300 thousand crowns. In addition, the European Parliament Directive on work-life balance for parents and carers <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158\">was passed</a> on 20 June 2019. This directive is to be implemented by 2 August 2022 in all Member States (Article 20) and, for example, extends the length of paternity leave to 10 days, which is an extension of <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/otcovska-dovolena-se-prodlouzi-na-deset-dnu/r~03b973acb82f11e9b16b0cc47ab5f122/\">three</a> days.</p><p> As for the change in maternity leave, MEP Maxová probably means the changes described in Article 5 of this <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?qid=1569858578087&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1158\">directive</a> . According to it, each parent is entitled to 4 months of parental leave. Two of these months are non-transferable and, according to Article 8, also paid. According to the directive, parental leave can also be conditioned by the total time worked or the duration of the employment relationship. However, this period may not exceed 1 year.</p><p> In response to this directive and the increase in parental allowance, Radka Maxová has already expressed herself in the past and even then demanded a systemic <a href=\"https://radiozurnal.rozhlas.cz/radka-maxova-rodice-volaji-hlavne-po-moznostech-skloubeni-pracovniho-a-rodinneho-7801534\">change</a> (video 10:40): &quot; <em>We wanted Minister Maláčová to say that if we were going to add this amount, then there needed to be a systemic change in the support for families from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. And that maybe we could talk about, could talk about, postponing the increase. So that it would be combined with work and private life, with the financing of children&#39;s groups, actually with the relationship to the directive that will be approved by the European Parliament</em> .&quot;</p><p> However, there has been no systemic change, i.e. a comprehensive amendment that would comprehensively regulate the individual institutions supporting working parents, including, for example, in connection with the aforementioned European directive. Individual areas are therefore amended separately, within separate amendments.</p><p> In addition to the amount of parental allowance, adjustments are also expected for children&#39;s groups. Children&#39;s groups <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/deti-jesle-platit-skupiny-prispevky.A190522_093831_domaci_elz\">are</a> places where children can be placed before starting kindergarten. There are currently 959 of these places in the Czech Republic with a capacity of over 14 thousand children. However, these children&#39;s groups are paid for from European funds, which will end after 2020 (groups that have applied for this will be funded until 2022).</p><p> The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs wants children&#39;s groups to be paid for from the state budget from <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2931710-jesle-se-vraci-malacova-chce-prejmenovat-detske-skupiny-a-hradit-je-z-rozpoctu\">2021</a> .</p><p> With the support of workers, one can also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske\">imagine</a> the emergence of part-time work. In the European Union, the Czech Republic <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-66249480-zapad-eu-valcuje-vychodni-zeme-bloku-v-podilu-lidi-pracujicich-na-zkraceny-uvazek-cesko-je-ve-srovnani-mezi-poslednimi\">is</a> among the countries with a lower popularity of part-time work. The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/jana-malacova-mpsv-castecny-uvazek-novela-zakonik-prace_1907161848_per\">expressed</a> a positive opinion on part-time work and stated that she is preparing an amendment to the Labor Code, which would include, among other things, the establishment of a shared job, which should support part-time work so that people can more easily have, for example, a twenty-hour workday.</p><p> VAT on home childcare services is also to <a href=\"https://www.finance.cz/527687-nizsi-dph-u-piva-holicky/\">be reduced</a> , which is another item that Radka Maxová <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2777228-maxova-podporme-rodiny-i-jinak-nez-rodicovskou-premyslime-o-snizeni-dph-na-detske\">mentioned</a> in the context of increasing the parental allowance. However, the VAT reduction <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2019/novela-zakona-o-evidenci-trzeb-miri-do-t-34995\">does not</a> include tax on children&#39;s needs.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because all the above-mentioned changes were not linked together. This procedure can therefore be described as non-systematic, given that the individual amendments are being prepared gradually and independently of each other. The situation will also be affected by the European Parliament directive, which is to be implemented by August 2022, children&#39;s groups will then be funded by the state possibly from 2021, but the so-called micro-nurseries ( <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/2741900-na-mikrojeslich-si-rodice-oblibili-hlavne-osobnejsi-pristup-k-detem-vznikaji-i-v\">nurseries with</a> a maximum of four children) have still not been resolved. The VAT reduction for home childcare services is then prepared, but the tax reduction for children&#39;s needs has not yet been adopted at all.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
