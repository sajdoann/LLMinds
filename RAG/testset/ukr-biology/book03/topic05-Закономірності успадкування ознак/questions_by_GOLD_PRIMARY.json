    "Using a specific example, explain how the phenotype of an organism can change in the course of its development.",
    "What is the difference between the concepts of \"genome\" and \"genotype\"?",
    "In a plant, an allele of one of the genes provides the synthesis of an enzyme that catalyses the reaction of a pigment that colours the perianth of a flower purple. The other allele of this gene synthesises a molecule that has a different spatial structure and cannot catalyse. Which of these alleles will be dominant and why?",
    "What notation is used when recording crosses?",
    "Name the laws of G. Mendel and draw crossing diagrams that illustrate them.",
    "Solve the genetic problem. In tomatoes, the gene R determines the colour of the fruit. The dominant allele of R provides a black colour, and the recessive allele of r provides a yellow colour. What traits will the first and second generation hybrids have when dominant and recessive homozygous individuals are crossed?",
    "Solve the genetic problem. In wheat, the red colour of the spikelet is caused by the dominant allele B, and the white colour is caused by the recessive allele b. What are the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring resulting from crossing two heterozygous individuals for this gene?",
    "Solve the genetic problem. In tomatoes, the gene R determines the colour of the fruit. The dominant allele of R provides a red colour, and the recessive allele of r provides a yellow colour. Their other gene is responsible for plant growth. The dominant allele H provides tall plants, and the recessive allele h provides dwarfism. What offspring and in what proportion will be obtained by crossing a diheterozygous individual with an individual with the rrhh genotype?",

    "Why are most traits of organisms controlled not by one gene but by several?",
    "Solve the genetic problem. In a plant, gene A determines the colour of the perianth. The dominant allele of A provides a red colour, and the recessive allele of A provides a white colour. Dominance is incomplete, and heterozygotes have a pink perianth colour. What genotypes and phenotypes will the hybrids resulting from the cross of two heterozygous individuals have?",

    "Some pea genes are contained in one chromosome, but their inheritance occurs according to the laws of G. Mendel, that is, independently. Explain how this is possible.",

    "Compare the mechanism of sex determination in butterflies and mammals.",
    "Solve the problem. The gene that determines the colour of a cat's coat is located on the X chromosome. One of its alleles determines black colour, and the other - red. If an organism is heterozygous for this gene, its colour is tortoiseshell (some hairs are black and some are red). What colour coat will the offspring of a cross between a red cat and a black cat have?",
    "Solve the problem. The gene that determines the colour of a cat's coat is located on the X chromosome. One of its alleles determines black colour, and the other - red. If an organism is heterozygous for this gene, its colour is tortoiseshell (some hairs are black and some are red). What colour coat will the offspring of a cross between a black cat and a tortoiseshell cat have?",
    "Compare the inheritance of genes located on the X and Y chromosomes.",

    "What are the types of mutations?",
    "What factors can be mutagenic?",
    "Why can living organisms be mutagenic?",
    "In males, gametes are formed throughout life after puberty. In women, they are formed during embryonic development. How can this affect the risk of mutations in offspring if the parents are over 40-45 years old?",
    "Explain the risk to the offspring of a person who uses drugs.",
