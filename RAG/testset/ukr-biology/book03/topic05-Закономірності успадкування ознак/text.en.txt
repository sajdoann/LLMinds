While studying the previous topic, you have already


learned that there is a science of genetics. And what does genetics study? You also already know what a gene is. Recall the definition of a gene. In what structures of the cell do genes contain genes?


Genotype and phenotypeImportant concepts in genetics are the concepts


of genotype and phenotype. A genotype is a system of genes in an organism that are manifested in the phenotype. The phrase "gene system" is used because most traits arise as a result of the interaction of genes. The genotype is the hereditary basis of an organism. It controls the formation of all its traits, that is, its phenotype.


Sufficient hydration


Phenotype is a system of external and internal


signs of an organism that are formed as a result of the realization of hereditary information in specific environmental conditions (Fig. 28.1). During the life of an organism, the phenotype changes. The boundaries within which the phenotypic manifestations of the genotype change are called the reaction norm.


Insufficient hydration


Alleles Very important for understanding the basics of genetics


Fig. 28.1. The influence of ¬

is the concept of an allele. From the point of view of genetics, an allele is one of the possible variants of gene manifestation. For example,

Fig. 28.2. Arrangement of alleles of one gene in homologous chromosomes


Fig. 28.3. External manifestation of the action of dominant and ¬
recessive alleles in individuals with different genotypes


The gene responsible for the color of pea seeds has two variants (alleles). One of them provides yellow color of seeds, and the other - green. There are genes that are represented by only one variant (allele). There are also genes with two, three or many alleles.


As you know, each gene is located in a certain area of one


of the chromosomes (this area is called the locus of this gene). Only one of the variants (alleles) of this gene can be located in a specific chromosome. But, as you already know, the nuclei of eukaryotes contain two identical (homologous) chromosomes. Therefore, each cell has two copies of each gene (Fig. 28.2).


If homologous chromosomes of an individual contain the same alleles of


a certain gene, it is called homozygous for this allele (from the Greek homo - the same), if different - heterozygous (from the Greek hetero - different). For example, if both alleles of a gene provide yellow color of pea seeds, then such a plant will be homozygous for the gene for seed coloring. If one allele provides yellow color,
and the other - green, then such a plant will be heterozygous for this gene.


Alleles of one gene can interact with each other. In this case,


one of them may not show its effect in the presence of the other or may show it incompletely. There are two types of alleles - dominant and recessive.


A dominant allele is an allele that is manifested in the phenotype


of a heterozygous organism. A recessive allele is an allele that is not manifested in the phenotype of a heterozygous organism. For example, if a plant is heterozygous for the flower color gene, that is, it contains two alleles of the flower color gene - lilac and white, and the lilac allele is dominant, then the flower will be lilac. And if


111. Topic 5


the plant is homozygous for the recessive allele, then the flower will be white (Fig. 28.3).


Methods of genetic research Genetics uses many methods for conducting research.


Some of them have a long history, and some have arisen recently.

Features of the method


Hybrid ¬
logical


It consists in crossing (hybridization) of organisms that differ from each other in one or more hereditary characteristics. For example, in the color of seeds, the shape of wings, the length of legs, etc. The offspring obtained from such a crossing are called hybrids. Hybridization is the basis of hybridological analysis - the study of the nature of inheritance of traits using a system of crosses


Genealogical Consists in the study of the pedigrees of organisms. This makes it possible to trace the nature of inheritance of different states of certain traits in a number of generations. With its help, you can calculate the probability of a certain trait in future descendants. For example, you can calculate the probability of a child with blue eyes in a family if a man and a woman have brown eyes, and their mothers were blue-eyed


Population statistical


Consists in the study of the frequency of occurrence of various alleles in populations of organisms. In addition to population genetics, it is also used in medical genetics to study hereditary diseases


Cytogenetic Consists in the study of the set ¬
of


chromosomes (karyotype) of organisms. Allows you to detect hereditary diseases. This method is also used in the systematics of organisms (karyosystematics). Thus, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and Drosophila has 4 pairs.


Biochemical It consists in studying the features of biochemical processes in organisms with different genotypes. It is used to diagnose hereditary diseases associated with metabolic disorders


. Twin It consists in studying twins. By studying twins, one can find out the role of environmental factors in the formation of the phenotype of individuals: the different nature of their influence determines the differences in the manifestation of certain signs.


Genetic engineering methods


Technologies by which scientists isolate individual genes from organisms or synthesize them artificially, rearrange certain genes, introduce them into other cells or organisms


112. Genotype and phenotype. Alleles. Genetic research methods


The hybridological research method was used by people


long before the emergence of genetics as a science. Even before our era, the practice of artificial pollination of date palms existed in the Middle East. This method was used later. Before the discovery of Mendel's laws, many animal breeds and plant varieties were created. And in many cases, hybridization was used during their creation.


The genealogical method also has a long history


.


During the Middle Ages, a lot of material was accumulated in European countries from the pedigrees of horses and dogs of different breeds.


The twin method was proposed by F. Galton (Fig. 28.4)


in the second half of the 19th century. And biochemical, cytogenetic and population-statistical methods entered scientific practice already in the 20th century, after the appropriate technologies of biochemical and mathematical analysis and chromosome staining appeared. Genetic engineering methods began to be developed in the second half of the 20th century.


The system of genes of an organism, which are manifested in the phenotype, is called the genotype, and the system of external and internal signs of the organism, which are formed as a result of the implementation of hereditary information in specific environmental conditions, is called the phenotype. Genes can manifest themselves in several
different variants (alleles). There are two types of alleles -
dominant (manifested in the heterozygous state) and recessive (not manifested in the heterozygous state). The following methods are used in genetic research: hybridological, genealogical, cytogenetic, biochemical, and others. P. Topic 5


Mendel's Laws

You already know what a gene is. Where


are genes located in a cell? Remember what structure a gene has. What are alleles of a gene? What are alleles? How does a genotype differ from a phenotype? Which chromosomes are called homologous?


Crossing organisms To conduct experiments in genetics and selection, scientists


cross organisms and study parental organisms and organisms of the first, second, and subsequent generations. Depending on the number of genes being analyzed, monohybrid (one gene), dihybrid (two genes), and polyhybrid (many genes) crosses are distinguished. The results of the experiments are recorded in the form of cross schemes. Special symbols are used for this (see p. 118).


The offspring that are formed as a result of crossing can


differ from each other in both phenotype and genotype. In such
a case, it is said that the trait has split in the offspring by genotype and phenotype (see p. 118).


Dominance of alleles As you already know, a dominant allele is an allele that is manifested


in the phenotype of a heterozygous organism. But the degree of dominance can be different.

Codominance Both variants of the trait manifest simultaneously. For example, a heterozygote by blood group contains both antigen A and antigen B on the membranes of erythrocytes, which are a consequence of the work of the corresponding alleles, simultaneously (alleles A and B are codominant). Allele 0 of this gene is recessive to other alleles and does not form an antigen. Heterozygotes containing this allele have either antigen A or antigen B on their membranes (


blood group AB blood group 0).


Research by G. Mendel. Gregor Mendel (Fig. 29.1) was a Czech priest, but he


was fond of botany. While studying the inheritance of various traits in peas, he created the foundations of the modern hybridological method used by geneticists.


In his experiments, G. Mendel was convinced that each parent


necessarily transmits one of the alleles of each of his genes to his offspring. He counted the number of different variants of traits in offspring, such as the color and shape of seeds, the color of flowers, the height of plants, etc., was able to establish the patterns of inheritance of traits and formulated his laws.


The laws of uniformity of first-generation hybrids and the splitting ¬


of hereditary traits in the descendants of a hybrid were formulated based on the results of monohybrid crosses. And the law of independent combination of hereditary traits was formulated based on the results of dihybrid crosses. The law of uniformity of first-


generation


hybrids


The descendants of the first generation from the


crossing of stable forms (organisms in which a certain trait has been manifested unchanged for many generations), which differ in one trait, have the same genotype and phenotype for this trait (Fig. 29.2, p. 116).

The laws of inheritance of traits are named after G. Mendel
, who formulated them in the middle of the 19th century. These include the law of uniformity of first-generation hybrids, the law of splitting hereditary traits in the descendants of hybrids, and the law of independent combination of hereditary traits. To denote genes and their alleles in cross-breeding schemes, letters of the Latin alphabet are used. Capital letters denote dominant alleles, and lowercase letters denote recessive alleles.P.Mini-guide

Trait as a result of gene interaction


30


You already know what a gene is and are familiar with the concepts of


genotype and phenotype. Recall the structure of a gene. What are the alleles of a gene? How does the inheritance of traits occur according to Mendel's laws?


Formation of traits In order for a certain trait to appear in an organism, several different processes must most often


occur. For example, in the fruit fly Drosophila (a classic object of research by geneticists), the color of the eyes is determined by the presence of two pigments in them - bright red and brown. Several biochemical reactions must occur to produce each of them. Each of these reactions is catalyzed by a separate enzyme, which is encoded by a separate gene. And the violation of any of them affects the color of the eyes of Drosophila (Fig. 30.1).


Interaction of genes Traits that are determined by one gene are called monogenic.


But even they can be formed as a result of interaction. You have already


become familiar with this phenomenon when you considered the concept of incomplete dominance of alleles.


There are many cases when


a trait or property of an organism is determined by two or more different genes that interact with each other. But it should be remembered that it is not the genes themselves that interact, but the protein or RNA molecules that they provide for their formation. During the interaction of non-allelic genes, a deviation from the Mendelian laws of splitting by phenotype in the offspring occurs.


The following main types


of gene interaction are distinguished: complementarity,


Fig. 30.1. Diversity of eye color in Drosophila

epistasis and polymerization. In addition, the modifying effect of a gene (pleiotropy), which is manifested in the determination of different traits by one gene, is considered separately.


Hybrid ( F 1 )

Complementarity During complementary


Hybrid ( F 2 )


gene interaction, the development of a trait occurs only in the case when each of the non-allelic genes has at least one dominant allele.


A–B–


A–bb and aaB –


aabb


For example, two genes, A and B, are involved in determining


the shape of a pumpkin fruit. If a particular plant has at least one


dominant


allele in each of these genes, then the


shape


of its fruit will be disc-shaped. And such a shape will be formed as a result of the interaction of dominant alleles of two genes. That is, disc-shaped fruits have any individuals with the genotype A–B– .


If one of the genes is represented by a recessive homozygote,


and the other has at least one dominant allele (individuals with genotypes aaB– and A–bb ), then the complementary interaction will not occur and the fruits will have a spherical shape. An individual with both genes in the recessive homozygote state will have elongated fruits (Fig. 30.2).


Epistasis
In the case of epistatic interaction of genes, the dominant or recessive


allele of one gene suppresses the manifestation of the dominant allele of the other gene. Accordingly, dominant and recessive epistasis are distinguished.


For example, in dogs, the dominant allele of gene A provides black


color, and the recessive one provides brown. And the dominant allele of gene I generally blocks the synthesis of the corresponding enzymes and causes the appearance of fawn color.


Therefore, individuals with genotypes A–ii will have black fur, with


genotypes A–І– or aaІ– — fawn, and with genotype aaіi — brown (Fig. 30.3, p. 122).

These genes perform one function (for example, provide the synthesis of one pigment), but can be located on different chromosomes. They are called polymeric genes.

Fig. 30.4. Polymeric interaction of genes


122. Trait as a result of gene interaction


Polymeric genes usually determine quantitative traits (size,


color, etc.). They act by complementing each other, so they are usually designated by the same letters of the Latin alphabet, adding a lower numerical index in order to distinguish genes from each other. For example, A 1 A 1 a 2 a 2 or A 1 a 1 A 2 A 2 .


This mechanism is used to inherit seed color


in wheat and skin color in humans. Thus, in the case of inheritance of wheat seed color, two polymeric genes interact, each of which has two alleles. And the color of the seeds is determined by the number of dominant alleles of these genes. The more dominant alleles, the greater the intensity of the red color. In recessive homozygotes, the seeds are white, and in individuals with the genotype A 1 A 1 A 2 A 2 it is dark red (Fig. 30.4).


Human skin color is determined by several genes. But the main role in this process is played by four polymeric genes. The more dominant alleles they have, the more melanin pigment is produced, which gives the skin the appropriate color. People with the genotype A 1 A 1 A 2 A 2 A 3 A 3 A 4 A 4 have the darkest skin, and those with the genotype a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 3 a 3 a 4 a 4 have the lightest.


The characteristics of living organisms are in most cases determined not by one gene, but by several. Even the interaction of alleles of one gene can cause the formation of a new characteristic, for example, in the case of incomplete dominance of an allele. The interaction of non-allelic genes can also cause the formation of characteristics. Examples of such interactions are the phenomena of complementarity, epistasis, and polymerization. P. Topic 5


Linked Inheritance and Crossing Over


31


In the previous paragraphs, you have already become familiar with


chromosomes and examined their structure. What is the structure of chromosomes? Where are they located in the cell? How do diploid and haploid sets of chromosomes differ from each other? Recall what crossover is and when it occurs.


Chromosomes and linkage groups After the discovery of G. Mendel's laws, science gradually began


to accumulate facts that in some cases the splitting of traits does not occur as predicted. It turned out that genes located on one chromosome are inherited together (linked). Such genes were called linked genes. And together, all genes located on one chromosome form a linkage group.


The number of linkage groups in organisms of a certain species is equal to


the number of chromosomes in a single (haploid) set, which is contained in the sex cells. For example, in Drosophila there are 4 of them, in cats - 19, and in humans - 23.


Gamete formation in the case of linked inheritance
An example of linked inheritance of genes can be the inheritance


of two traits in the fruit fly Drosophila - body color and wing shape. Black color ( a ) and rudimentary wings ( b ) are determined by recessive alleles, and gray body ( A ) and long wings ( B ) are dominant. The genes that determine these traits are located side by side on one chromosome.


What will happen if we cross a female Drosophila that is


recessive homozygous for these traits (genotype aabb ) with a male that has two dominant alleles on one chromosome and two recessive alleles on the other (genotype AaBb )? If these traits were inherited independently, then a heterozygous fly would produce four types of gametes: Ab , aB , AB , and ab . But the traits are inherited in a linked manner, and therefore only two types of gametes are produced: AB and ab (males do not cross over). Accordingly, the offspring from this cross will have only two phenotypes: a gray body with long wings and a black body with rudimentary wings (Fig. 31.1).

Fig. 31.1. Linked inheritance of genes in Drosophila


Chromosomal theory of heredityHow exactly are traits inherited if the genes that control them


are located on one chromosome? The answer to this question was given by the chromosome theory of heredity. It was formulated at the beginning of the 20th century. in Europe. But it was substantiated and formulated in its modern form by the American geneticist T. H. Morgan (Fig. 31.2) with his students.


The chromosome theory of heredity was based on the fact of the


existence of linkage groups, which were chromosomes. This theory explained the deviations from Mendel's laws during the splitting of those traits that are inherited in a linked manner in descendants.


It should be noted that T. X. Morgan successfully


chose the object for his research. He chose the fruit fly Drosophila, which later became a classic object for genetic experiments. Drosophila are easy to keep in laboratories, they are distinguished by their above-average fertility, rapid generational change (under optimal conditions of maintenance, a new generation appears every one and a half to two weeks) and a small number of chromosomes, which simplifies observation.


Researchers determined how


wing length and body color in Drosophila are inherited.


Fig. 31.2. Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866–1945)


125. Topic 5


They crossed Drosophila with genotypes AaBb and aabb , resulting in flies with two phenotypes formed from gametes AB and ab , instead of the predicted four. This was only possible if the two genes were located side by side on the same chromosome. Such experiments made it possible to substantiate the chromosome theory of heredity.


The main provisions of the chromosome theory of heredity
— Chromosomes are the material basis of heredity.
— Genes are located in chromosomes in a linear sequence. — Genes that are localized in one chromosome form one


linkage group and are transmitted to descendants together.


— The number of linkage groups is equal to the haploid number of chromosomes. — The haploid number of chromosomes is constant for each species. — Traits determined by linked genes are also


inherited linked. —


Crossovers and exchange of sections


can occur between homologous chromosomes .


— The frequency of crossover is directly proportional to the distance between genes. Mechanism of crossover In the experiments of Morgan and his colleagues, while studying


the inheritance of linked traits, it was discovered that among Drosophila hybrids there is a certain part of flies with a recombination of these traits and a violation of linked inheritance occurs. This was a consequence of crossover.


You already know that crossover is the exchange of sections of homologous


chromosomes during meiosis. It is because of crossover that there is no absolutely complete coupling of genes, in which they would always be transmitted together. The further apart they are located on the chromosome
, the more often the phenomenon of crossover occurs.


Crossover between chromatids of homologous chromosomes can


occur simultaneously at several points. Crossover that occurs at only one point is called single, at two points simultaneously is called double, at three points is called triple. In fact, in living cells, crossover is always multiple (Fig. 31.3), and all other options relate to specific genes that are studied in a certain coupling group. Gametes in which crossover has occurred are called crossover.


Chromosome mapsBased on the provisions of the chromosome theory of heredity and


using the mechanisms of crossover, scientists have created a genetic

chromosome maps. A genetic map of a chromosome is its graphic image with the location of genes marked on it. The map indicates the names of genes, the distances between genes, and sometimes the location of the centromere. The maps can show not only the normal alleles of the corresponding genes, but also their mutant forms (Fig. 31.4).


Genetic maps of chromosomes are especially detailed for the


chromosomes of Drosophila and corn, with which geneticists have been working for many years. They have been compiled for the chromosomes of humans and many domestic animals and cultivated plants. These maps are of great importance for breeding work and the diagnosis of severe hereditary human diseases.


The features of the location of genes in chromosomes and the mechanisms of their linked inheritance are described by the chromosome theory of heredity. Genes contained in one chromosome
form the so-called linkage group and are ¬


inherited together. Usually linkage is not complete. Violation of linkage is explained by the phenomenon of crossing over. P. Topic 5


Sex Genetics and Sex-Linked Inheritance


32


You have already studied the features of the structure and formation of


germ cells. Representatives of which sex form spermatozoa, and which sex - eggs? Recall what advantages the presence of different structural germ cells and, accordingly, two sexes provides in living organisms.


Methods of sex determination In living organisms, there are several ways to determine


the sex of an individual that will develop from a zygote. The future sex can be determined by external conditions (if a bonellia worm larva is at the bottom of the ocean, it develops into a female, and if it is on a female proboscis, then a male), the ploidy of the organism (in bees and ants, haploid individuals are males, and diploid individuals are females), or special sex chromosomes, as in Drosophila (the other chromosomes in this case are called autosomes) (Fig. 32.1).


Sex chromosomes
If an organism determines its sex using sex chromosomes


, then it has one or two such chromosomes. If there are two sex chromosomes, then they usually differ in size (one large, the other small). And individuals of different sexes have either two large chromosomes (homogametic sex), or one large and one small (heterogametic sex). Such chromosomes are designated by Latin letters. For example, a large chromosome can be designated by the letter X, and a small one by the letter Y.

Fig. 32.2. Gamete formation by different variants of homo- and heterogametic sex


In different organisms, both female


and male sex can be homogametic. For example, in mammals and flies, the homogametic sex is female (its representatives have two X chromosomes, genotype — XX), and the heterogametic sex is male (its representatives have one X and one Y chromosome, genotype — XY). In most birds and butterflies, on the contrary, the homogametic sex is male (its representatives have two identical chromosomes, but they are designated by a different Latin letter - Z, genotype - ZZ), and the heterogametic sex is female (genotype - ZW) (Fig. 32.2).


Sex-linked genes Genes located in sex chromosomes are called


sex-linked genes. Examples of such genes are eye color genes in the X chromosome of Drosophila, color blindness and hemophilia genes in the X chromosome ¬
of humans, and hypertrichosis and ichthyosis genes in the Y chromosome of humans.


129. Topic 5


A feature of sex-linked genes is that they can


be in a hemizygous state. A hemizygous is a diploid individual that has only one allele of a certain gene. This condition arises due to the fact that individuals of one sex have two different sex chromosomes. For example, in cats, the X chromosome has many genes, and the Y chromosome has few. Because of this, even recessive alleles of the X chromosome genes will manifest themselves in the phenotype, because there is no second chromosome with a dominant allele.


Inheritance of sex chromosome genes Let us consider the features of the inheritance of genes linked to sex


, using the example of mammals. With genes located on the Y chromosome of males, everything is simple. They are transmitted directly from male to male and cannot manifest themselves in females. They are always in a hemizygous state, because normally there is only one of this chromosome in the cell nucleus.


The inheritance of genes located on the X chromosomes is more


complicated. In the female body, they behave like ordinary genes of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), because there are two X chromosomes. In the male body, these genes manifest themselves in a hemizygous state. Therefore, traits determined by recessive alleles of such genes always appear in males. And they receive them from their mothers (Fig. 32.3).

130. Sex genetics and sex-linked inheritance


In some animals, sex chromosomes are of the same type, and one sex has only one sex chromosome, and the other has two identical ones. For example, among bugs, lizards, and some birds, there are species with male and female genotypes ZZ and Z 0 and X 0 and XX, respectively (the number 0 in the notation means the absence of the second pair of chromosomes).


The platypus has five pairs of sex chromosomes. Its gametes contain either five X chromosomes or five Y chromosomes. These chromosomes form one complex and always separate together during cell division. The common ancestor of monotremes and other mammals, which lived about 165 million years ago, did not yet have sex chromosomes.


In living organisms, there are several ways to determine the future sex of an organism. One of the most common is using sex chromosomes. In mammals, males have sex chromosomes XY, and females have XX. Genes located in sex chromosomes are called sex-linked genes. Traits determined by recessive alleles of genes on the X chromosome are manifested in males, but are transmitted through females. Genes located in the Y chromosome are transmitted directly through the male line. Topic 5


Forms of variability.
Modification (phenotypic)
and combinatorial variability


33


You have already become familiar with the science of genetics.


Recall what genetics studies. What patterns do Mendel's laws describe? How do genes interact with each other? What consequences does crossover lead to?


Variety of forms of variability


You already know that variability is the property of living organisms


to change. These changes can occur both with the organism itself over a certain period of time and with the change of generations in each species of living organisms.


Geneticists distinguish two main forms of variability - hereditary


(genotypic) and non-hereditary (modification or phenotypic). Changes that occur in the case of hereditary variability are transmitted to descendants. Changes that occur in the case of non-hereditary variability are not transmitted to descendants.


Hereditary variability is divided into combinatorial and mutational.


With combinatorial variability, the DNA structure does not change.
Only recombination of alleles of different genes occurs. With mutational variability, the DNA structure can change (you will learn about this in the next paragraph).


Modification (phenotypic) variability


Non-hereditary variability is also called phenotypic or modification


. Modifications are phenotypic changes that occur under the influence of environmental conditions. Modification changes in a trait are not inherited, but its range (response rate) is genetically determined and is inherited. They do not cause changes in the genotype. Modification variability corresponds to the conditions of existence, is adaptive.


As a result of this variability, under the influence of


environmental factors on the organism, the intensity of enzymatic reactions changes or certain genes are “turned on” or “turned off”. A characteristic feature of modification variability is reversibility - the disappearance of changes in the event of the disappearance of specific environmental conditions, which causes the occurrence of modification. 132.

Fig. 33.1. Modification variability in animals and plants


Examples of modification variability are:— change in the body weight of animals in the event of a change in the amount of food;— change in the color of fur in a white hare after the onset of winter


(Fig. 33.1);


— change in the size of individual leaves on one tree (Fig. 33.1);— formation of a tan on human skin under the influence of sunlight


.


Combinatorial variationCombinatorial variation is associated with obtaining new combinations


of genes in the genotype. You are already well acquainted with this type of variation on the example of the laws of G. Mendel and the interaction of genes.


In eukaryotes that reproduce sexually, combinatorial


variation is achieved as a result of three processes:


— independent divergence of chromosomes during meiosis; — random combination of gametes during fertilization; — recombination of genes due to crossing over. The genes themselves do not change, but new combinations arise


, which leads to the appearance of organisms with different genotype and phenotype.

Fig. 33.2. Combinatorial variation in pea plants


Examples of combinatorial variation are: — the appearance of plants with pink flowers in the case of crossing


plants with white and red flowers under incomplete dominance (Fig. 33.2);


— the appearance of pea plants with yellow wrinkled seeds


in the second generation of offspring from crossing plants with green wrinkled and yellow smooth seeds.


Combinatorial variation in prokaryotes Combinatorial variation occurs not only in eukaryotes,


which carry it out during sexual reproduction. Microorganisms that reproduce asexually have also developed special mechanisms of combinatorial variation. These are conjugation, transduction, and transformation.


Conjugation is direct contact between two bacterial


cells using special hollow tubes (F-piles), during which genetic material from one cell is transferred to another. Conjugation is usually controlled by genes located in a plasmid.


Transformation is the transfer of DNA that has been isolated


from one bacterial cell to another. It most often occurs after the death of bacterial cells. After


the


dead cells are destroyed, individual fragments of their DNA can be absorbed by other bacteria. The bacteria then incorporate these fragments into their circular DNA molecule.


Transduction is the transfer of bacterial genes from one


cell to another by a bacteriophage. When bacteriophages multiply in a cell, some of the viral particles contain DNA from bacteria, not viruses. The viral particle carries this DNA to another bacterial cell, where it is incorporated into the bacterial chromosome.


Through such processes, bacteria can, for example,


exchange antibiotic resistance genes.


Scientists often distinguish ontogenetic variability as a separate type of variability. It occurs during the life of an individual under the control of genes. It is this variability that is responsible for the fact that the same person at the age of one, six, twenty and seventy looks completely different. The consequence of combinatorial variability is the phenomenon of heterosis. Heterosis (Greek heterosis - modification, transformation), or "hybrid force", can be observed in the first generation in the case of hybridization between representatives of different species
or varieties. There are three main forms of heterosis: reproductive (
increased yield), somatic (increased linear dimensions of the organism) and adaptive (increased resistance to environmental factors).


Variability is divided into hereditary and non-hereditary. Changes that arise as a result of non-hereditary (modification) variability are not transmitted to descendants. Changes that arise as a result of hereditary variability are transmitted to descendants. Hereditary variability is divided into combinatorial and mutational. With combinatorial variability, the DNA structure does not change, but with mutational variability it can change. P. Topic 5


Mutations


34


You have already learned how the


DNA structure can be disrupted and how cells fight this. What types of DNA structure disorders do you know? What DNA repair mechanisms exist? Why is it important for a cell to keep DNA intact?


Mutational variability Mutational variability arises as a result of changes


in the structure or number or location of DNA molecules. You have already become familiar with the causes of these disorders and the DNA repair mechanisms that allow you to eliminate such disorders. But if the
repair mechanisms do not cope with the task, then
a DNA change occurs, which will be transmitted to descendants. A mutation will occur. It should be noted that in multicellular organisms, only those mutations that have arisen in the sex cells will be transmitted to the descendants.


Serhiy Ivanovych Korzhynsky (1861–1900)


Mutations A mutation (Latin mutatio — change) is


a change in a trait caused by a change in hereditary structures, a restructuring of the genetic apparatus. Mutations change the genotype of an individual. They arise suddenly and sometimes give the organism significant differences from its original form.


Scientists have known about such changes for a long time.


S. I. Korzhynsky and G. de Vries devoted their works to mutational variability (Fig. 34.1). The latter coined the term “mutation”. In addition, he formulated the main provisions of the theory of mutations (1901–1903):


— Mutations arise suddenly as discrete


(


intermittent) changes in traits.


— New forms are stable. — Unlike non-


hereditary variability, mutagenic


traits do not form continuous series and do not


136. Mutations


are concentrated around some average type. Mutations are qualitative changes in organisms.


— Mutations manifest themselves in different ways. They can be both harmful


and beneficial.


— The probability of detecting mutations depends on the number


of individuals studied.


— The same mutations can occur repeatedly. Diversity of mutations Currently, mutations are known in all groups of living organisms. There are


many mutations in humans. It is mutations that cause the diversity
(polymorphism) of human populations: different skin pigmentation, hair, eye color, shape of the nose, ears, chin, etc.

Topic 5


Classification of mutationsThere are several variants of the classification of mutations. According to the type of manifestation


of the trait in a heterozygote, mutations are divided into dominant (manifested in a heterozygote) and recessive (not manifested in a heterozygote). According to localization in the cell, nuclear (change genes located in the cell nucleus) and cytoplasmic (change genes located in the cell cytoplasm, for example, in mitochondria or plastids) mutations are distinguished. Depending on the cause of occurrence, spontaneous (the cause of occurrence is not established) and induced (the cause of occurrence is the action of an established factor - physical, chemical or biological) mutations are distinguished.


It is also important in which cells mutations occur.


If they occur in somatic cells - somatic mutations, then they can be transmitted to descendants only under the condition of vegetative reproduction. If they occur in gametes - generative mutations, then they can be transmitted to descendants during normal sexual reproduction.


Gene, chromosomal and genomic mutations However, one of the most common classifications of mutations is their


distribution according to the level of organization of the hereditary material at which the mutation occurs. If a mutation changes only one gene (replacement, loss or addition of a pair of nucleotides), this is an example of a gene mutation. In the case when a complex of genes on a chromosome is affected (replacement, loss, addition or change in the location of a section of the chromosome), this is an example of a chromosomal mutation. And when changes occur at the genome level (change in the number of individual chromosomes or the entire chromosome
set), this is an example of a genomic mutation.


Genomic mutations include polyploidy and heteroploidy (aneuploidy ¬


). Polyploidy is an increase in the number of chromosomes by adding entire chromosome sets as a result of a violation of meiosis.


Heteroploidy is a change in the number of chromosomes that is not a multiple of


the haploid set. The phenomenon when any of the chromosomes in the genotype has not two, but three homologous chromosomes is called trisomy. ¬
The loss of one of the homologous chromosomes also occurs - monosomy.


Mutagenic factors Factors that are capable of inducing a mutational effect are called


mutagenic. It has been established that any factors of the external and internal environment that can disrupt homeostasis are capable of causing mutations. Traditionally, they are divided into physical (X-ray and other radiation, ultrasound, temperature, etc.), chemical (chemical compounds) and biological (viruses, toxins) (Fig. 34.2).


138. Mutations


Physical Chemical Biological


Fig. 34.2. Mutagenic factors


Harmful habits can pose a significant threat to humans as mutagens


. Both smoking, alcohol and drugs are quite strong mutagenic factors. They lead to an increase in the risk of mutations in offspring.


Mutagenic factors are widely used in breeding practice


in order to obtain new varieties of plants and animal breeds. Thus, plants are affected by critical temperatures, ionizing radiation, and chemicals (the most common alkaloid is colchicine).


Mutations change the genotype of an individual. They arise suddenly and change the DNA of the organism. There are several variants of the classification of mutations. According to the level of organization of the hereditary material that is damaged, gene, chromosomal and genomic mutations are distinguished. Mutations are caused by the influence of mutagenic factors - physical, chemical or biological. A significant threat to humans as mutagens is posed by smoking, alcohol and drug use. P. Topic 5


Hereditary human diseases. Genetic counseling


35


In the previous paragraph, you learned about


mutational variability. What types of mutations do you know?
What factors are called mutagenic? What mutagenic factors pose a threat to humans?


Human genetics and hereditary diseases Human genetics studies the phenomena of heredity and variability in


human populations, the features of inheritance of normal and pathological traits, the dependence of the disease on genetic predisposition and environmental factors.


An extremely important task of human genetics is the study of


the mechanisms of the occurrence of hereditary diseases. This is hard work, but in some cases geneticists have already achieved significant success.


As in other living organisms, genetic disorders in humans


can occur at different levels of the organization of hereditary material. Accordingly, genomic, chromosomal and gene diseases occur.


Genomic and chromosomal diseases of humans Genomic and chromosomal diseases of humans are usually very


severe and are rarely compatible with life. For example, in the case of the formation of a triploid zygote, the embryo dies at a fairly early stage of development. Changes in the number of chromosomes in individual pairs (trisomies and monosomies) are also known. However, in most cases, embryos with such disorders also die.


There are only a few exceptions. For example,


infants with trisomies on the 13th (Patau syndrome), 18th (Edwards syndrome) and 21st (Down syndrome) chromosomes survive to birth. However, patients with Patau and Edwards syndromes have significant developmental anomalies of various body systems and live very short lives. Patients with Down syndrome (Fig. 35.1) live longer but have health problems.


An example of a chromosomal disorder in humans is Le


Gene syndrome, which results from the loss of a fragment of chromosome 5. It is also called the cat cry syndrome, because the cry of many children with this syndrome resembles this sound.

Chromosomal diseases can also be Patau,


Edwards, and Down syndromes (Fig. 35.2). In some cases, they arise not as a result of complete trisomy, but as a result of the transfer of the short arm of a certain chromosome to some other chromosome.


More often than with autosomes, there are violations of the number of


sex chromosomes. The genotypes XYY and XXX do not have any special external physical manifestations. But in the case of a further increase in the number of sex chromosomes, problems arise.


Hereditary diseases are Klinefelter syndrome (


genotype XXY) (Fig. 35.2) and Shereshevsky-Turner syndrome (there is only one X chromosome in the genome).

Human genetic diseases With the help of modern research methods, about


5,000 molecular diseases have already been discovered that are a consequence of the manifestation of mutant genes. Some of these diseases cannot yet be treated, but treatments have been found for others.


Examples of human genetic diseases


Disease
Information about the disease


Cystic fibrosis Occurs as a result of damage to a gene located on chromosome 7. Causes thickening of the secretions of the exocrine glands. Causes significant disturbances in the digestive and respiratory systems


Phenylketonuria Occurs as a result of damage to a gene located on chromosome 12. Causes the inability to process the amino acid ¬
phenylalanine. If left untreated, it leads to damage to the nervous system


Color blindness Occurs as a result of damage to one of the three genes responsible for the synthesis of the opsin protein, which perceives the corresponding color. The blue opsin gene is located on chromosome 7, and the red and green genes are on the X chromosome. Causes the loss of the ability to perceive the corresponding color


Hemophilia Occurs as a result of damage to one of the genes responsible for the blood clotting process. These genes are located on the X chromosome. Causes blood clotting disorders

Hemophilia is an example of a sex-linked genetic disease.


It became well known after the inheritance of this disease was established in the descendants of Queen Victoria of England (Fig. 35.4). The queen herself did not suffer from hemophilia. But from one of her parents she received an X chromosome with a defective variant of the corresponding gene.


Genetic counselingThere are currently hundreds of diseases known, in which the mechanisms of biochemical


disorders have been studied in quite detail. But hereditary human diseases are much easier to prevent than to cure. Therefore, a system of genetic counseling has been created to prevent them. In genetic counseling, you can analyze the pedigrees of parents and calculate the risk of having a child with a hereditary disease.


You can conduct tests and detect diseases of the fetus while still


in the mother's body. Examination of newborns is very important. With the help of a simple test, you can detect
phenylketonuria at an early stage. This allows you to prevent the development of this
disease by transferring the child to a special diet. The use of molecular genetic methods for diagnosing hereditary diseases is also extremely promising.


Humans have such hereditary diseases as Patau, Edwards, Down, and Klinefelter syndromes, which are associated with a change in the number of chromosomes. There are also genetic diseases associated with damage to individual genes. These are phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, color blindness, hemophilia, etc. To prevent hereditary diseases, a system of genetic counseling has been created. P. Topic 5


Methods of genetic research. Modern methods of molecular genetics


36


While studying this topic, you have become familiar with the basic


laws of heredity and variability of living organisms. Remember what substances and structures are the material basis of heredity. How do the mechanisms of protecting DNA from damage work?


Advantages of modern molecular genetic methods


Molecular genetic methods work mainly with


DNA and protein molecules. These molecules are not as variable as morphological
features. In addition, the interpretation of morphological features can be much greater when comparing them. For example, one can argue which of the morphological features is more important - the shape of the ear or the length of the horns. But there is no dispute about the importance of ribosomal RNA.


By comparing the DNA and proteins of different organisms, it is possible to reconstruct


their evolution in the past. Even so far back that there were no fossil remains for study. Since the pre-cellular stage of the evolution of life (Fig. 36.1).


Modern molecular genetic methods


Modern molecular genetic methods can be conditionally divided into


several groups. These are methods of isolating and purifying the desired molecules, methods of amplifying (copying) DNA, methods of hybridization, and methods of data processing and modeling. Usually, all research methods are used in combination.

Hybridization methods


Allow the presence of certain nucleic acid molecules in samples


to be recognized using special probe molecules. Certain DNA molecules are recognized. They use the property of DNA chains to form double chains with molecules that have corresponding nucleotide sequences.


Data processing and modeling methods.


They create models that can be used to test hypotheses about the evolutionary relationships of organisms.


They create databases of DNA molecule sequences of different species and analyze information using special computer programs.


Modern molecular genetic research methods have significant advantages over traditional methods. They provide significantly greater opportunities for conducting research and increasing the reliability of their results. Such methods include methods for isolating the desired molecules from samples, methods for DNA amplification, methods for hybridization, methods for information processing, etc. P.
