    "Among the first generation hybrids, all will have pink petals.",
    "Among the second generation hybrids, dwarf plants with yellow fruits will be 1/16.",
    "If the first generation hybrids from this cross are crossed with individuals with the genotype aabb, then among their descendants, tall plants with yellow fruits will be 1/4.",
    "The property of an organism to change its organization, as well as acquire new characteristics in the process of individual development is called phenotype.",
    "G. Mendel formulated the laws of heredity, having traced them with peas.",
    "An individual with the genotype AaBb forms gametes: AB, ab and Ab.",
    "Drosophila has four pairs of chromosomes in somatic cells. Therefore, the number of linkage groups in Drosophila is 4.",
    "The smallest number of genes among human chromosomes is contained in the Y-chromosome.",
    "Knowledge about heredity and variability in human life is important because it helps us understand how traits are passed down from parents to offspring, aids in genetic counseling, and can lead to advancements in medicine and agriculture."
