The amendment was approved by the Chamber of Deputies in the third reading. At the 19th meeting of the Chamber of Deputies on 13 September, the chairman of the Pirates, Ivan Bartoš, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/019schuz/s019100.htm\">questioned</a> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš about the amendment to the Civil Service Act. The Pirates criticize the amendment on the grounds that, according to them, it strengthens political influence in the state administration and may increase the risk of dismissing inconvenient civil servants.</p><p> Prime Minister Andrej Babiš stated in his response to the interpellation: <em>&quot;So you are creating an atmosphere here that we have been doing some kind of purge. When you are not in it and you are a minister and you have a state secretary who does whatever he wants, does not go to work, is antisocial, threatens a mother who has a home office, and we have one like that, a state secretary. And when you have a subordinate who is not working well, who has caused damage, then try to explain to me how we should replace him. And we have been fighting this for a long time.&quot;</em></p><p> He continued: <em>&quot;It is absurd for the minister to be there in the number, for the state secretary to actually do whatever he wants. So that he cannot de facto, if he is dissatisfied with a direct subordinate, so that he cannot replace him. So try talking to Adam Vojtěch, he has probably been in charge there since February. He asked for some disciplinary proceedings and now we are waiting for the highest official. Because the highest official, Mr. Postránecký, is more than the government. More! That is absolutely top!&quot;</em></p><p> The Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013059.htm\">commented</a> on the amendment to the Civil Service Act at the 13th meeting of the Chamber of Deputies on May 23, 2018, where he stated: <em>&quot;I am appearing before you on behalf of a ministry that has long been affected by the highest staff shortage of all central state administration bodies in the Czech Republic. In 2016, it was 65%, the occupancy rate in the ministry. In 2017, I took over the Ministry of Health in a situation where every third employee was missing, when some departments had only department heads without rank-and-file employees. In this complicated situation, I was supposed to fulfill a program, which, however, was slowly becoming impossible to implement with anyone. And unfortunately, it is not possible to this day. When I was looking for the cause of these problems after I took office at the ministry, I conducted a questionnaire among employees, a relatively extensive questionnaire survey, in which over 80% of employees participated. And I am deeply convinced that the main reason for this catastrophic situation in the healthcare sector is the long-term inability to effectively staff manage employees from the highest position in the ministry, i.e. from the position of State Secretary.&quot;</em> He further stated: <em>&quot;I filed a disciplinary complaint against the State Secretary on February 12. The disciplinary committee has not even met to date</em> - <em>and I say again that we are facing a fundamental personnel destabilization and personnel shortage at the Ministry of Health. I therefore believe that disciplinary proceedings are not a completely appropriate tool for resolving the unsystematic, purposeful and often irrational behavior of responsible persons.&quot;</em> He also mentioned in his speech the case where the State Secretary at the Ministry of Health illegally delayed the selection process for the position of Director of the State Institute for Drug Control.</p><p> It is therefore clear from the quotes that both are complaining about the protracted disciplinary proceedings and the impossibility of immediately implementing a change. They are not saying – as Bartoš suggests in his statement – that a change cannot be implemented at all, on the contrary, they are trying to achieve change through specific steps (disciplinary proceedings).</p><p> Let us add that, according to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-234?text=§60#f5357312\">Section 60</a> of the Civil Service Act, a state secretary can only be dismissed in cases defined by law (e.g., termination of service, medical incapacity, etc.). In addition, this is possible if &quot; <em>the service evaluation contains a conclusion that he achieved unsatisfactory results in service&quot;.</em> However, such <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/sluzba/clanek/sluzebni-hodnoceni.aspx\">a service evaluation</a> is done once a year and if it is unsatisfactory, a new one is done in 6 months. If he reaches the fourth level of evaluation twice, i.e. &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, he can be dismissed, which is also <a href=\"https://www.mkcr.cz/stanovisko-k-80-zakona-o-statni-sluzbe-163.html\">explained</a> in his opinion by the &quot;super-official&quot; Postránecký. Thus, the dismissal process takes at least a year and a half.</p><p> According to Section 60, paragraph 4 of this Act, service also ends on the day the decision on disciplinary action in the form of dismissal or dismissal becomes legally binding. However, it must be taken into account that, according to the Administrative Code, it is possible <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p81-1\">to appeal</a> against the decision of the first-instance disciplinary committee to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-234/zneni-20170801?porov=20170701#p93-1\">the second-instance</a> disciplinary committee, and only then does the decision become legally binding.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>The Chamber of Deputies&#39; proposals for granting or awarding state decorations, specifically the nomination for the decoration of Karel Sýs, were <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=67755\">voted</a> on May 25, 2018. 14 Pirate deputies voted in favor. However, the Pirates later apologized for voting for the state decoration for Karel Sýs. Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Vojtěch Pikal, who admitted his mistake in an interview with iRozhlas.cz, said <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/statni-vyznamenani-2018-karel-sys-basnik-vojtech-pikal_1805261809_ako\">the following</a> :</p><p> &quot; <em>I made the mistake of not studying the personalities enough. I relied on the words of the other deputies from the subcommittee. I thought I would have more time to prepare that day. I did not know that I would be presiding over the Chamber and standing in for Speaker Vondráček (Radek Vondráček from ANO), who suddenly lost his voice.&quot;</em></p><p> While Pikal apologizes for not having studied the personalities well enough, Chairman Bartoš talks about the item being put forward and the vote being taken by mistake. According to <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013121.htm\">the shorthand report,</a> the vote was as follows:</p><p> <em>PSP Deputy Chairman Vojtěch Pikal: The next proposal is Karel Sýs.<br/> PSP Deputy Chairman Vojtěch Filip: I have started voting number 96 and I am asking who is in favor. Who is against? Thank you.<br/> Voting number 96. Of the 161 deputies present, 108 voted in favor, 25 against. The proposal was adopted.</em></p><p> Pirates chairman Ivan Bartoš commented on the vote for Karel Sýs in an interview <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/474479-pirat-bartos-nekdy-delame-hlouposti-a-obcas-naletime-ale-jsme-pokorni.html\">as follows</a> :</p><p> &quot; <em>Nominations for the award were supposed to be discussed only at the end of the second week, but they were put forward. We had not gone through them. About three names were voted on in the plenary session within one minute, some Pirate MPs noticed the problematic Mr. Sýs and abstained from voting, some followed Vojta Pikal&#39;s recommendation.&quot;</em></p><p> On October 25, 2018, a vote was also taken on <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/013schuz/s013117.htm\">a proposal</a> to permanently include item 117 regarding state awards on the same day, and this proposal was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=67735\">adopted</a> . The shortened period before the vote may therefore have had an impact on its outcome, although we cannot verify whether the Pirates voted &quot;by mistake&quot;.<br/><br/> The nomination required 81 MPs to vote in favor. The proposal to nominate Karel Sýs for the state award was approved, with a total of 108 MPs voting in favor, including 14 MPs from the Pirate Party. So even if the Pirate Party MPs had not voted in favor of the proposal, it would still have passed.</p>\nSECTION C: <p><a href=\"http://www.korupce.cz/cz/o-nas/o-nas-104793/\">The Department for Combating Corruption</a> is an organizational unit of the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic. The activities of this department must be in accordance with the Statute and Rules of Procedure of the Government Council for the Coordination of the Fight against Corruption. The Council was established by <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/PJUA9NDCLZA9\">a government resolution</a> of 30 July 2017.</p><p> Ivan Bartoš mentions <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=10700\">the Working Group for the Assessment of Legislation on Anti-Corruption Measures</a> . It was founded by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Radek Vondráček (ANO). The aim of this <a href=\"https://www.rekonstrukcestatu.cz/cs/archiv-novinek/12067-poslanci-vytvorili-novou-pracovni-skupinu-proti-korupci\">group</a> is to find consensus in the approval of anti-corruption laws by means of discussion forums for members of political parties, non-profit organizations, and the public. Those interested in discussing drafts of current laws should meet approximately once a month, and the first meeting, held on February 1, 2018, was attended by representatives of several political parties.</p><p> There is no mention in the public media space of the existence of the aforementioned version, which would allow for, for example, an information embargo.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>A trust fund is, according to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2012-89#p1448\">§1448</a> et seq. of the Civil Code, an entity without legal personality. It is created by separating the founder&#39;s property. The creation of a trust fund creates separate and independent property that has no owner.</p><p> Although the ownership rights to the trust fund are exercised by the trustee, it is necessary to be aware that, according to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2012-89#p1448-3\">Section 1448(3)</a> of the Civil Code, the ownership rights to the fund do not belong to the trustee, the founder, or the person who is to receive payments from the trust fund.</p><p> It cannot be claimed that someone is the owner of the assets in the trust fund. However, it is possible to infer from Ivan Bartoš&#39;s speech that he is convinced that Andrej Babiš still has a decisive influence on the assets in the trust fund, even though he is not its owner according to the law.</p><p> If this were true, then it could be said that Andrej Babiš is the beneficial owner of the trust fund as understood by Act No. 253/2008 Coll., on certain measures against the legalization of proceeds from crime and the financing of terrorism. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2008-253#p4-4\">Section 4(4)</a> of this Act, the beneficial owner of a trust fund would be a person who has the factual or legal ability to exercise direct or indirect decisive influence over the trust fund.</p><p> Provided that these conditions are met, there is <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2008-253#p4-4-c\">a rebuttable presumption</a> (&quot; <em>it is presumed that&quot;</em> ) that the beneficial owner of the trust fund is, for example, the founder, trustee or beneficiary. For the sake of completeness, let us state that the Civil Code <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2012-89#p1457-1\">defines</a> the beneficiary as the person who <a href=\"https://www.pravniprostor.cz/clanky/obcanske-pravo/sverenske-fondy-pravni-uprava-a-jejich-vyuziti\">benefits</a> from the trust fund. This is related to Act No. 304/2013 Coll., on public registers of legal and natural persons, which establishes <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2013-304#p118b\">a register of beneficial owners</a> . However, this register <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2013-304#p118c\">is not</a> a public register.</p><p> Although the registered data on the founder and beneficiary of the trust fund <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2013-304#p65e-1\">are not disclosed</a> without consent, it is possible to conclude that the beneficiary and founder is Andrej Babiš. This is indicated by the publicly available data on the trustees (they are Alexej Bílek and Zbyněk Průša), as well as <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-podava-prvni-podnet-tykajici-se-stretu-zajmu-andreje-babise/\">the findings of</a> Transparency International (see also <a href=\"http://www.taxparency.eu/cz/structures/#TS4_MAFRA\">the graph</a> below, or the table <a href=\"http://www.taxparency.eu/structures/pdf/TS4_MAFRA.pdf?2\">here</a> ).</p><p> In connection with this information and other data from <em>the Register of Public Sector Partners,</em> two<a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/wp-content/uploads/Open-Letter-to-the-European-Commission.pdf\">complaints</a> were <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-issues-a-second-complaint-about-andrej-babiss-conflict-of-interest-and-european-subsidies-for-agrofert/\">filed by</a> the Czech Transparency International regarding Babiš&#39;s possible conflict of interest. Unlike the register of beneficial owners, <em>the Register of Partners</em> is public and Andrej Babiš <em>appears</em> as one of <a href=\"https://rpvs.gov.sk/rpvs/Partner/Partner/Detail/7859\"><em>the ultimate beneficiaries,</em></a> along with the two aforementioned trustees.</p><p> For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to note that <em>the ultimate beneficial owner</em> is a term defined in <a href=\"https://www.zakonypreludi.sk/zz/2008-297/znenie-20180315#p6a\">Section 6a</a> of Act No. 297/2008 Coll. on <em>protection against legalization of proceeds from crime and terrorism.</em> According to <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-agrofert-sverenske-fondy-premier-transparency-international_1806192243_haf\">the statements</a> of the AGROFERT concern and Andrej Babiš, this term is different from the term <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2008-253#p4-4\">beneficial owner</a> under Czech law. <br/><br/><br/></p><p></p><img src=\"https://demagog.cz/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaXNJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c67f0f037d3f7ce119556aa0fcc8be289a6c9602/TI5_MAFRA_struktura.png\" alt=\"\"/><p></p>\nSECTION E: <p>Chairman Bartoš (Pirates) is referring to the amendment to the Civil Service Act. The amendment proposal was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=132\">submitted</a> by the government on March 26, 2018.</p><p> Documents that demonstrate the European Commission&#39;s critical stance on the amendment were published on June 7, 2018 by <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj\">the iRozhlas.cz</a> server. Specifically, it is <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf\">a letter</a> (.pdf) addressed to the Deputy Minister of the Interior for the Civil Service, <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/vedeni-ministerstva-260932.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Mg%3D%3D\">Josef Postránecký</a> . The letter states that, based on a meeting on March 20, 2018, both parties reached a consensus on the need for further amendments to the draft Civil Service Act. The first part of the letter summarizes the commission&#39;s conclusions from the Report on the Czech Republic 2018 ( <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/2018-european-semester-country-report-czech-republic-en.pdf\">.pdf, p. 37</a> ). The criticism was directed at the administrative burden resulting from the proposal, the inability to attract experts from the academic and private sectors. The letter also mentions a large number of dismissals in leading positions after the new government took office, which does not correspond to the desired depoliticization of the state administration ( <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf\">.pdf, p. 1</a> ).</p><p> This part of the letter is crucial: &quot; <em>We therefore remain concerned about key elements of the proposal. For example, the shift to somewhat lower requirements for second rounds of selection procedures for management positions, the possibility of dismissing managers based on</em> a &#39; <em>sufficient</em> &#39; <em>evaluation result, the possibility of dismissing civil servants based on two performance evaluations within a 40-day period, and the deprivation of managers from the possibility of filing an objection to performance evaluations.&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/documents/d0b0437d5b7c038f391131ae6517a6c4.pdf\">.pdf, p. 2</a> - translation by <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-novela-sluzebniho-zakona_1806070600_pj\">the iRozhlas.cz</a> server used).</p><p> The European Commission&#39;s criticism was directed at changes in the evaluation of civil servants&#39; work and the shortening of the period between individual evaluations.</p><p> The extension of the minimum period of 40 days between individual assessments to 60 days, or in the case of an extraordinary assessment after a previous assessment with an <em>unsatisfactory</em> result to 90 days, was presented in an amendment by Kateřina Valachová (ČSSD) ( <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138713\">docx, pp. 4 and 10</a> ). Her amendment was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=68390\">adopted</a> .</p><p> Minister Dostálová (ANO) submitted an amendment to Section 60, paragraph 3 ( <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138717\">.docx, page 1</a> ):</p><p> <em>&quot;X. In Section 60, paragraph 3, first and second sentences, the words &quot;, State Secretary&quot; are inserted after the words &quot;Deputy for Civil Service&quot;.<br/><br/> X. In Section 60, the following sentence is added at the end of paragraph 3: &quot;A proposal to dismiss the Deputy for Civil Service and the Human Resources Director of the Civil Service Section shall be submitted to the Government by the Minister of the Interior, a proposal to dismiss the State Secretary shall be submitted to the Government by the relevant minister or the head of the Government Office after discussion with the Deputy for Civil Service.&quot;</em></p><p> According to Dostálová&#39;s amendment, the dismissal of state secretaries is therefore possible based on a government decision following the recommendation of the minister, as Bartoš states in his statement.</p><p> The expansion of the scale and conditions of personal evaluation was regulated by the proposal in Section 155 (. <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134549\">pdf, p. 24</a> ), among other things, it planned to expand the evaluation scale from 4 to 5 categories:</p><p> , <em>,3) The performance evaluation must contain a conclusion on whether the civil servant achieved in the service</em></p><p> <em>a) excellent results,</em></p><p> <em>b) very good results,</em></p><p> c <em>) good results,</em></p><p> d <em>) satisfactory results, or</em></p><p> (e <em>) unsatisfactory results.”</em></p><p> The proposal therefore implies that the evaluation scale has been expanded. To terminate the employment relationship, it is &quot;enough&quot; to obtain a rating of d) and e), in the words of Chairman Bartoš, &quot; <em>a five or a four&quot;.<br/></em><br/> The initial wording of the draft amendment regulated the conditions for dismissal from service in Section 60, Article 1, Part b): &quot; <em>the service evaluation contains a conclusion that the official achieved unsatisfactory or satisfactory results in service&quot;</em> ( <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=134549\">.pdf, p. 16</a> ). In this case, no <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=138947\">amendment proposal</a> (.pdf) was submitted that would specifically change this provision. It can be said that the possibility of dismissing an official from service for a <em>satisfactory (&quot;four&quot;)</em> evaluation thus remained in the proposal, although (as of November 1, 2018) we cannot <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?o=8&amp;v=US&amp;ct=372&amp;fbclid=IwAR1xFaCcnQoQ8hlHnDguF5qbwVymlDT-FybJNQ7rJoXSGHSwBNBtEzdVrus\">confirm</a> this with the press, which the Senate should now have. The EC&#39;s reprimand in this case was not corrected by the amendments, and we therefore assess the statement of Chairman Bartoš as untrue.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
