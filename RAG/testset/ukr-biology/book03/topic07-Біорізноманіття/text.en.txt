Fundamentals of Evolutionary Phylogeny and Systematics


44


When you were introduced to the biology of plants and animals,


you learned about the basic principles of the systematics of organisms belonging to these groups. Remember, are there any differences in the systematics of plants and animals? What groups are the Plant kingdom and the Animal kingdom divided into?


Biological systematicsBiological systematics is a section of biology that forms a single


system of the living world based on the allocation of biological taxa (systematic units) and the corresponding names given according to certain rules (biological nomenclature).


The main systematic categories were introduced into science by the Swedish scientist


Carl Linnaeus. The main systematic category is the species. The species name consists of two Latin words, the first of which is the name of the genus, and the second is the specific epithet. Related species are combined into higher taxonomic categories - genera, genera - into families, and those - into even higher categories.

Species → Genus → Family → Order → Class →

of the organic world (phylogeny). To study phylogenesis, modern

Biology widely uses the latest technologies. Methods from the field of molecular biology and genetics and microscopic studies are especially effective. Mathematical modeling and construction of phylogenetic trees are also widely used.


A phylogenetic tree is a diagram that reflects the evolutionary


relationships between the taxa for which it is constructed (Fig. 44.1). Phylogenetic trees can be constructed not only for taxa of living organisms. They can be created, for example, for certain biopolymers - such as proteins or nucleic acids.


Biological systematics is a section of biology that forms a single system of the living world based on the allocation of biological taxa. The main systematic categories were introduced into science by the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus. P. Topic 7


Main groups of organisms: viruses, bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes


45


You have already become acquainted with representatives of plants,


animals, viruses and bacteria. Recall the characteristic features of these groups. What representatives of these groups do you know? Which of these groups has the largest number of species?


The Three-Domain System
In 1990, Carl Voss, based on the analysis of the


rRNA nucleotide sequence and some other molecular characteristics, proposed a new version of the taxonomy of living organisms. According to him, organisms were divided into large systematic groups - domains. A domain is a taxon of the highest rank, which includes several kingdoms of living organisms.


Cellular life forms were divided into three domains - Bacteria, Archaebacteria


and Eukaryotes. Viruses were isolated as a separate taxon Vira, which unites non-cellular life forms and corresponds to the domain in rank.


This classification most accurately reflects modern ideas about


the origin and evolution of the main groups of living organisms (Fig. 45.1).


Features of the main groups of living organisms To compare the main groups of living organisms


, such characteristics as the presence of a cellular structure, features of the organization of genetic material, the presence of a nucleus and membrane organelles in the cell, and the development of the cytoskeleton are used.

Taxon


Vira Viruses A non-cellular form of life. Can reproduce only in the cells of other organisms. Contain only one nucleic acid - either RNA or DNA


Bacteria, cyanobacteria


Domain Bacteria


Cellular organisms. Cells do not have a nucleus and membrane organelles. They are distinguished by a significant variety of biochemical processes in cells. Genetic material is usually represented by a large circular DNA molecule (bacterial chromosome). May have plasmids. Genes do not contain introns


Domain


Archaea Archaebacteria Cellular organisms. They differ significantly from other domains in the composition of lipids and proteins. Cells do not have a nucleus or membrane organelles. Genetic material is usually represented by a large circular DNA molecule (bacterial
chromosome). They may have plasmids. Some genes contain
introns


Domain Eukaryotes


Plants, animals, fungi, unicellular eukaryotic organisms


Cellular organisms. Cells have nuclei and other membrane organelles and a cytoskeleton. Genetic material is contained in chromosomes and has the form of linear DNA molecules. Small circular DNA molecules are present in mitochondria and plastids. Genes contain introns


In addition to the three-domain system, other systems are sometimes used, although they are considered obsolete. This is the two-empire system, which divides organisms into the empires (superkingdoms) Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes, and the five-kingdom system - it distinguishes the kingdoms Prokaryotes, Protists, Fungi, Plants and Animals.


According to the modern classification, cellular life forms are divided into three domains - Bacteria, Archaebacteria and Eukaryotes. Viruses are distinguished as a separate taxon Vira, which unites non-cellular life forms and corresponds to the domain in rank. P. Topic 7


Overview of the main eukaryotic
taxa


46


In previous classes, you studied the features of the structure


and vital activity of many groups of eukaryotic organisms. Which representatives of eukaryotes are unicellular? How do they differ from multicellular organisms?


The system of eukaryotes Eukaryotes are the largest domain of cellular


organisms in terms of the number of species. Their systematics is still the subject of debate. Some researchers suggest allocating up to 20 kingdoms among eukaryotes. For example, some scientists combine all protozoa into one group. In this case, amoebas, ciliates and euglena are considered representatives of one kingdom Protista. And other scientists divide the simplest into several groups. In this case, amoebas, ciliates and euglena will be representatives of different kingdoms. This is due to the peculiarities of the origin of eukaryotes.


In the process of evolution, they repeatedly included


intracellular symbionts in their cells. These symbionts became organelles such as mitochondria and plastids. And plastids could become not only various cyanobacteria, but also various eukaryotic algae. Therefore, it is often quite difficult to determine the systematic affiliation of some groups of eukaryotes.


Features of the main groups of eukaryotes
To compare groups of eukaryotes


, such characteristics as the presence and composition of the cell wall, the number of nuclei in the cell, the presence of plastids, unicellularity or multicellularity, and the type of nutrition are used.

Infusoria Infusoria-shoe, didinium, trumpeter They


do not have a cell wall. There is a dense cover - a pellicle, which supports the shape of the cell. The cells have two nuclei - a small (micronucleus) and a large (macronucleus). Heterotrophs. Unicellular organisms
