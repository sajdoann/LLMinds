Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: HAVLÍČEK: (...) and then we have NÚKIB, an independent institution. TAKÁČ, moderator: Who stated what he stated that it is a security risk (Huawei, note: Demagog.cz). HAVLÍČEK: Yes, he stated it at the end of last year. At the moment, if I have the correct information, an audit of all devices is actually underway at the state level.\nSECTION B: ALSO, moderator: And the European Union, the European Commission appreciated it? You said. Does that mean some philosophical reservation like: no nuclear, that&#39;s out of the question, that wasn&#39;t made? HAVLÍČEK: In no case was it made at all. On the contrary, what was said was that it is right that we are heading towards a zero-emission economy, or rather energy, ad 1 and ad 2, it was clearly said that nuclear is a zero-emission source. The fact that someone has a tendency from time to time, especially from among the critics, to question that, that was said literally and literally by the Director General, (...) that&#39;s what the Director General of the Directorate General Energo, the European Commission, said directly.\nSECTION C: If you look, in Slovakia it cost, I mean Mochovce, three, four, which is approximately 1000 MW of power, it cost 6 billion euros. Yes, someone still claims, but you already had a base there in the order of one to two billion, so let&#39;s admit that it was 7 billion. That means, then it&#39;s around the amount of 100, 150, 160, 180 billion. It depends on the exchange rate used to convert it.\nSECTION D: So we definitively announced that we are really going nuclear, we described what will be discussed, i.e. the fifth unit in Dukovany, and at the same time the so-called official negotiations have begun, which are not yet the exact itinerary of what, where, who will do exactly, but we had to start documenting why we are actually getting started. And the fundamental argument is clear, and I must say that the European Commission highly appreciated it - we are heading towards emission-free energy, that is, we will exchange coal, which today has a share of more than forty percent, for a higher position, i.e. the emergence of higher nuclear and renewable sources, and these are absolutely fundamental messages that to a certain extent actually correspond today with the priorities of the European Union or the European Commission.\nSECTION E: And what is also extremely important, what was said by the European Commission, is that the energy mix is somehow the exclusive competence of individual European Union countries. We will not interfere with how you model it, on the other hand, you must meet certain legislative criteria also vis-à-vis the European Commission in terms of, for example, illegal support and the like. And if you meet all of this, we are ready to notify the process. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>Fiala refers to the political mistake in the statement as coalition cooperation with the KSČM. The ODS banned such a form of cooperation by adopting <a href=\"https://docplayer.cz/9878146-Xvii-kongres-ods-xvii-kongres-ods-18-19-11-2006-praha.html\">a resolution</a> (p. 120) at the 17th Congress in 2006: <em>&quot;The ODS Congress orders the ODS Executive Board to revoke the licenses of local associations that cooperate in coalition with the KSČM at the municipal level.&quot;</em></p><p> The ODS <a href=\"https://moje.ods.cz/stanovy#clanek3\">statutes</a> state in Article 3, point 7, part f) on termination of membership: &quot; <em>Membership in the party terminates: by cancellation of membership by the local assembly or executive board due to a serious breach of obligations set out in section 3.14 of the statutes or due to a final conviction of a member for an intentional crime.&quot;</em> Further in point g): <em>&quot;if the local association terminates and the member does not submit an application for re-registration to another local association within three months of termination.&quot;</em></p><p> In Article 7, point 3, part f), the statutes state that the Executive Board&#39;s powers are &quot; <em>to decide on the establishment (by granting a license) and the dissolution (by revoking a license) of local associations&quot;.</em> In part h), it adds &quot; <em>to decide on the dissolution of membership pursuant to clause 3.7, letter f) of the statutes.&quot;</em></p><p> The Executive Board has decided to revoke the licenses of local associations in connection with cooperation with the KSČM several times. In <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1282064-ods-zrusila-18-sdruzeni-kvuli-spolupraci-s-kscm\">2011</a> , the licenses of 18 local associations were revoked. <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1290728-ods-hodla-kvuli-koalicim-s-kscm-zrusit-az-30-sdruzeni\"></a> There were <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1290728-ods-hodla-kvuli-koalicim-s-kscm-zrusit-az-30-sdruzeni\">30</a> local cells that were threatened with having their licenses revoked due to their coalition with the KSČM in 2011. One of the dissolved local associations was the organization in Rychnov nad Kněžnou. However, as <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/zakaz-koalic-s-komunisty-ods-nepomohl-mesta-ho-porusuji/r~4464b4d4560511e49bec0025900fea04/?redirected=1533021181\">the Aktuálně.cz</a> server found out, the cell there eventually reached an agreement with the party leadership and kept its license. This was despite the fact that the ODS members in Rychnov continued to form a coalition with the KSČM. For example, in Týnec nad Sázavou, the party cell was actually dissolved and the representatives continued to exercise their mandate as independents. At the same time, there are known cases where ODS members who entered a coalition with the communists at the local level announced their withdrawal from the ODS and decided to continue in the coalition as independents. This happened, for example, in <a href=\"https://vary.idnes.cz/starostove-kterym-zrusili-sdruzeni-chteji-opustit-ods-p2j-/vary-zpravy.aspx?c=A110301_095926_vary-zpravy_sou\">Aš and Březová</a> .</p><p> The ODS Executive Board dealt with the revocation of licenses from local cells due to coalition cooperation with the KSČM, for example, in 2007, when, according to the <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vykonna-rada-ods-resi-spolupraci-strany-s-komunisty-na-komunalni-urovni_200703312105_mmatusu\">iRozhlas.cz</a> server, two licenses were revoked in the Olomouc region. Thus, licenses are revoked from party cells in the event of non-compliance with the resolution from the 17th Congress prohibiting cooperation with the KSČM, although in some cases the license was ultimately not revoked.</p><p></p>\nSECTION B: <p>In Kladno, after gaining <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=1&amp;xdz=8&amp;xnumnuts=2103&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=0\">202,233 votes</a> , the Volba pro Kladno party won, as in 2014. It thus won 13 seats in the council, which has a total of 33 members. The party will nevertheless eventually head to the opposition. The parties ODS, SPD, ANO and the Kladeňáci movement <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/volby/volby-2018-komunalni-volby-volba-pro-kladno-opozice_1810071733_dbr\">have agreed</a> to cooperate, and according to the coalition agreement, Dan Jiránek (ODS), who has already led the city in the past, is to be the mayor.</p><p> Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://volby.idnes.cz/kladno-koalice-ods-spd-top-09-hrozba-vylouceni-ze-strany-pip-/volby.aspx?c=A181008_121958_volby_kop\">stated</a> through a press spokesman that the situation in Kladno &quot; <em>is not entirely standard.</em> &quot; And further: &quot; <em>As far as I know, the campaign in Kladno was very heated, accompanied by massive anonymous attacks on the opposition.</em> &quot; ODS deputy chairman Martin Kupka also pointed out the heated nature of the election campaign and <a href=\"https://volby.idnes.cz/kladno-koalice-ods-spd-top-09-hrozba-vylouceni-ze-strany-pip-/volby.aspx?c=A181008_121958_volby_kop\">said</a> about cooperation with the SPD: <em>&quot;It is a coalition that I do not prefer, but I understand the arguments that my colleagues</em> (from the Kladno ODS, note: Demagog.cz) <em>presented to the ODS</em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> However, not every party leadership is as tolerant of the formation of a coalition with the SPD as the ODS leadership. <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/okamura-se-raduje-ods-a-top-09-pomohly-jeho-strane-k-vladnou/r~9a3f8512cab611e8b634ac1f6b220ee8/?redirected=1542212809\">Petr Hašek</a> , a member of TOP 09 and also a member of the Kladeňáci movement, was faced with the choice of either leaving the coalition or the party. In the end, he decided on the latter option.</p><p> The aforementioned escalation of the campaign in Kladno can be proven by the post-election <a href=\"https://kladensky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/povolebni-boj-pokracuje-v-kladne-se-mnozi-trestni-oznameni-20181010.html\">developments</a> . Criminal charges were filed by both the old-new mayor Dan Jiránek from the ODS and representatives of the former mayor Milan Volf (Volba pro Kladno). However, we were unable to find any concrete evidence that would illustrate the escalation of the campaign, nor any credible information about the spreaders of defamatory news.</p><p> Kladno is not the only city where the ODS cell deviated from its preferred line; in other cases, however, it is primarily about cooperation with the KSČM. In <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xdz=2&amp;xnumnuts=7104&amp;xobec=513750&amp;xstat=0&amp;xvyber=0\">Hranice,</a> a broad coalition (or rather a &quot; <em>working</em> <a href=\"https://olomouc.idnes.cz/hranice-siroka-koalice-zastupitelstvo-funkce-kritika-opozice-tajemnik-rezignace-gip-/olomouc-zpravy.aspx?c=A181109_438556_olomouc-zpravy_stk\"><em>group</em></a> <em>aimed at developing the city</em> &quot;) was formed of seven parties and movements that made it to the council. These are ANO, the association Our Beautiful Hranice, Hranice for Life, Hranice 2000, the communists, the ODS with the support of the Free Democrats, and the SPD. In response to <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/218411030501104#t=4m38s\">criticism</a> (video, 4:41) of cooperation with the KSČM, the six-member local ODS council in Hranice <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/mistnim-sdruzenim-ods-ktere-spolupracuji-s-kscm-hrozi-zruseni/1683221\">resigned</a> , and the Regional Council <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2644691-hranicka-ods-ma-prijit-o-licenci-duvodem-je-zakazana-povolebni-spoluprace-s\">proposed</a> revoking the license of the local ODS association in Hranice. Given that the ODS is resolving the coalition in Hranice (although more in connection with cooperation with the KSČM, which regional cells are prohibited from doing), Kladno remains the only tolerated city with a coalition with the SPD.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>In his statement, Fiala draws attention to the different positions of the last two foreign ministers, Hamáček and Petříček, on the Global Compact on Migration.</p><p> Jan Hamáček defended the adoption of this document during the discussion in <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/019schuz/bqbs/b20417001.htm\">the Chamber of Deputies</a> , stating, among other things: &quot; <em>I will try to explain to the chairman of the ODS club why it is good to have this document, even if it is non-binding.&quot;</em></p><p> His successor, Petříček, however, takes the opposite position. In his <a href=\"https://www.cssd.cz/aktualne/aktuality/vyjadreni-ministra-zahranicnich-veci-k-rozhodnuti-vlady-ze-cr-nepristoupi-ke-globalnimu-paktu/\">statement</a> on the Global Compact, for example, he states: &quot; <em>We should therefore withdraw from the compact negotiation process, as the United States, Hungary and Austria did.&quot;</em></p><p> So Fiala is right: both ministers had different positions on the Global Compact, which is why we consider the statement to be true.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>At the outset, it should be clarified that Chairman Fiala is talking about <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236\">Act</a> No. 236/1995 Coll. (abbreviated as the salary of constitutional officials). The so-called <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236#p3-3\">automaton</a> , or linking the salary of constitutional officials to the state of the economy, is reflected in the determination of a certain <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236#p8-1\">coefficient</a> by which the so-called salary base is multiplied. This is 2.75 times the &quot; <em>average nominal monthly salary of natural persons in the non-business sphere achieved according to published data from the Czech Statistical Office for the calendar year before last</em> &quot; <em>.</em> In other words, for 2019, the salary base is calculated as 2.75 times the average monthly salary for 2017 and determined by the communication of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.</p><p> The above-described machine itself was already part of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2002-309#cast33\">Act</a> No. 309/2002 Coll., on amendments to laws related to the adoption of the Act on the Service of Civil Servants in Administrative Offices. At that time, the salary base for representatives designated by the Act was to be three times the average monthly wage for the year before last. The purpose of this establishment was actually <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=28676\">to establish</a> a &quot; <em>stable link between the salaries of constitutional officials and the development of wages in the non-business sphere</em> &quot; (.doc, p. 36). The procedural history of this provision then consisted primarily in the several postponements of the effectiveness of this act or the annulment of individual provisions of the Act on the Salary of Constitutional Officials by the Constitutional Court. The final <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359\">amendment</a> to Act No. 359/2014 Coll. from 2014 <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=191422&amp;pdf=1\">comes</a> (.pdf) from the pen of Jan Hamáček, the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. The original government proposal (Bohuslav Sobotka&#39;s government) <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=110647\">envisaged</a> (.pdf) a fixed salary of CZK 52,248 for the next four years, and in the end, Hamáček&#39;s amendment was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=7&amp;t=277\">accepted</a> instead.</p><p> The new salary range was thus determined by determining a new <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359#f5469272\">multiple</a> for deputies (2.75) and a special multiple for judges (3.00). Given the difference between the fixed amount for 2014 and the amount given by the multiple in 2015, Hamáček&#39;s proposal <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359#f5469273\">provided for</a> a gradual annual increase in the multiple over four years. The salary base should thus reach 2.5 times the average wage for the year before last in 2018.</p><p> Petr Fiala and the entire ODS did not vote for either Hamáček&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=60088\">amendment</a> or the final wording <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=60089\">of the law</a> . The majority abstained, and in the second vote two deputies were against. Therefore, the expression &quot; <em>we agreed</em> &quot; used by Chairman Fiala in his statement is somewhat questionable.</p><p> As for the meaning of the statement about &quot; <em>creating a solution that we will not have to return to</em> &quot;, the amendment may directly imply an effort after 2018 (when the salary was calculated by a multiple of 2.5) to immediately jump to calculating with a multiple of 2.75 in the following year. According to <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2643791-pirati-a-spd-pozadali-o-schuzi-snemovny-k-platum-bude-asi-16-listopadu\">data</a> from Czech Television (infobox note), however, such a procedure would cause the salary of a deputy and senator to increase by 14,700 CZK. The government, which proposed <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=167\">an amendment</a> to the Act on the Salaries of Constitutional Officials, is probably aware of this. It <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135103\">should</a> (.pdf, p. 3) permanently reduce the multiple for the calculation back to 2.5 and also change the average that will be multiplied.</p><p> It was also the ODS&#39;s votes that moved the proposal from the first reading to committees, which means that the Chamber of Deputies, including the ODS, will consider this proposal and will return to addressing the salaries of MPs, thanks to the ODS.</p><p> To summarize the assessment, the timing of the adoption of the amendment is appropriate, but the intention not to return to discussing salaries does not follow from the ODS&#39;s vote so far, which concerns the new government draft amendment (the discussion <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/022schuz/22-1.html\">took place</a> on November 15, 2018).</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

We don&#39;t have the permission of the Libyan government, we don&#39;t have the permission of the UN Security Council, so the admiral is operating in that area, but he can&#39;t fight the smugglers on Libyan territory. So what is he doing? He says here that I have destroyed 551 ships and detained 151 migrants. But he will first save the ship and they are not random castaways, according to maritime law. They go there on purpose, yes. And by the way, there are still those non-profit ships waiting there that send signals: come, come, we are waiting. So they have to transport them to the port, the migrants are excited, within two hours, they have already tried it. They will say, well, that&#39;s the smuggler, he was on the ship with us. The smugglers then go to prison and then they destroy the ship. So this is really not like a systemic solution.

The quotas <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">were</a> approved by EU interior ministers in September 2015. In December of the same year, Slovakia and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">filed</a> a lawsuit with the Court of Justice of the EU against the redistribution of asylum seekers based on quotas. In June 2017, for example, the Czech government <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vlada-cesko-uz-neprijme-zadneho-migranta-na-zaklade-kvot-zhorsila-se_1706051706_pj\">decided</a> that it would no longer accept any asylum seekers based on quotas, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">accepting</a> 12 of the 2,600 people allocated.</p><p> The European Commission then decided to open infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In September 2017, the relocation programme for applicants from Greece and Italy <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">ended</a> , with 29,144 people out of 160,000 being relocated and only five countries fulfilling their quotas. In April 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">had failed to fulfil</a> their obligations under European Union law.</p><p> On the contrary, in 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3173733-od-vety-zvladneme-uplynulo-pet-let-rozhodla-bych-se-stejne-tvrdi-merkelova\">took a</a> welcoming stance towards accepting refugees with her famous media statement &quot;we will <i>manage it</i> &quot;. At that time, Germany <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/migr_asyappctza/default/table?lang=en\">was</a> also the country with the highest number of asylum applications. However, Armin Laschet, the CDU candidate for chancellor in the September German elections, has now expressed the opposite. After the capture of Kabul, <a href=\"https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fluechtlinge-afghanistan-121.html\">he stated</a> that Germany &quot; <i>must not give the impression that we can accept every person in need</i> &quot;.</p><p> French President Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/evropsky-parlament/v-evrope-rostou-nove-ploty-unie-se-boji-uprchlicke-vlny-z-af/r~a5d8490204d511ec966d0cc47ab5f122/\">spoke</a> about the need to &quot; <i>defend against illegal migration</i> &quot; after the fall of Kabul. His predecessor, François Hollande, chose a different rhetoric in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-france/hollande-opens-french-doors-to-refugees-despite-opposition-idUKKCN0R70WC20150907\">saying he</a> would &quot; <i>get the crisis under control</i> &quot; and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/french-president-francois-hollande-welcomes-refugees-paris-attack/story?id=35274658\">defending</a> his decision to uphold his refugee admission commitments despite the terrorist attacks in Paris.</p><p> Six EU member states, including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/six-countries-urge-eu-not-stop-deportations-afghanistan-belgium-says-2021-08-10/\">sent</a> a letter to the European Commission in early August 2021 warning against halting deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers, despite the Taliban&#39;s advance in their homeland. However, Germany, along with another signatory of the letter, the Netherlands, subsequently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">announced</a> that they would not deport the unaccepted Afghans for the time being due to the development of the conflict. However, Austria <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">did not change</a> its position and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-austria-pm-wont-take-in-any-more-afghanistan-refugees-taliban/\">ruled out</a> accepting people fleeing Afghanistan, saying that this would not happen during his term in office. The Greek Minister for Migration, whose country <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/grafika-reseni-migracni-krize/r~1a7e43b8e45911e59e52002590604f2e/\">faced</a> a strong influx of migrants due to its position during the last crisis and is another signatory of the letter, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">said</a> that &quot; <i>the EU is not prepared and does not have the capacity to handle another major migration crisis</i> &quot;.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>In the parliamentary elections in 2013, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">384,174</a> votes, and in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">572,948</a> , or 49% more. This number fits within our tolerance of 10% deviation. In percentage terms, it was 7.72% and 11.32% of the votes, respectively. At the same time, the party received 56.25% more seats ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">25</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">16</a> ). </p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-69s2T\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/69s2T/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"273\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20161007&amp;xv=2\">2016</a> Senate elections, the party won only two mandates, compared to 9 in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005\">2018.</a> In the 2018 elections, it also <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/volby/senat?k=2&amp;t=uspesnost-stran\">defended</a> only 4 mandates. So, ODS is also succeeding in fulfilling this goal in the Senate elections. Moreover, ODS won in the last Senate elections, as Petr Fiala further claims. In <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=2\">2018</a> , ODS candidates won a total of 9 mandates in 27 constituencies. Candidates for the second most successful party, STAN, won only 3 mandates.</p><p> In the European Parliament elections, the party has also managed to meet the 50% growth target, and even significantly exceeded it. In 2014, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> votes, and in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , an increase of 196%. At the same time, the party received almost double the percentage of votes in 2018 ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">14.54%</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">7.67%</a> in 2014). The number of seats won by ODS doubled from two in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> to four in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">the last</a> elections. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the European Parliament elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ebPAZ\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ebPAZ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"290\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the context of the European elections, the part about second place, doubling the number of mandates and tripling the number of votes is also true. In the last EP elections, ODS indeed finished <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep?xjazyk=CZ\">second</a> behind the ANO movement. In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> elections, the party won 2 mandates, while in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">this year&#39;s</a> elections it won 4. The number of votes from 2014 is <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> , and from 2019 it was <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , which is approximately 2.96 times more.</p><p> In the elections to city and municipal councils, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9,178,453 votes in 2014. In 2018, it <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 14,905,827 votes. The result thus exceeds the target set by Fiala by 1,138,147 votes. In percentage terms, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9.26% of the votes in 2014, and 13.56% in <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">the following</a> elections. It therefore received 0.33% less than the commitment assumes. However, the result fits within our 10% tolerance. The party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 2,398 mandates in 2014, which is 3.86%. In <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">2018</a> , it received 2,600, or 4.2%. It is therefore clear that the party did not meet this Fiala target in terms of the number of mandates in the municipal elections. However, even in these elections, the commitment was fulfilled in two of the three possible calculation methods (absolute number of votes and percentage of votes), therefore we evaluate the statement as a whole as true. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in municipal elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-jUB4F\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jUB4F/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"277\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p></p>\nSECTION C: <p>In his statement, Fiala draws attention to the different positions of the last two foreign ministers, Hamáček and Petříček, on the Global Compact on Migration.</p><p> Jan Hamáček defended the adoption of this document during the discussion in <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/019schuz/bqbs/b20417001.htm\">the Chamber of Deputies</a> , stating, among other things: &quot; <em>I will try to explain to the chairman of the ODS club why it is good to have this document, even if it is non-binding.&quot;</em></p><p> His successor, Petříček, however, takes the opposite position. In his <a href=\"https://www.cssd.cz/aktualne/aktuality/vyjadreni-ministra-zahranicnich-veci-k-rozhodnuti-vlady-ze-cr-nepristoupi-ke-globalnimu-paktu/\">statement</a> on the Global Compact, for example, he states: &quot; <em>We should therefore withdraw from the compact negotiation process, as the United States, Hungary and Austria did.&quot;</em></p><p> So Fiala is right: both ministers had different positions on the Global Compact, which is why we consider the statement to be true.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Fiala speaks about two things in his statement. According to him, the Global Compact on Migration is a vague document and ceases to distinguish between legal and illegal migration. As a second fact, he states that the same objections to this document are heard from other European countries. We do not take the phrase “most European countries” literally, but only verify whether these views appear in a larger number of countries.</p><p> <a href=\"https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/sites/default/files/180713_agreed_outcome_global_compact_for_migration.pdf\">The Global Compact</a> states that this document is not legally binding (p. 2, point 7). This is a declaration that does not contain any sanctions, and this type of document contains general principles rather than specific commitments.</p><p> As for the distinction between legal and illegal migration, the Covenant allows states to do so. “ <em>States may distinguish between legal and illegal migration status (...)</em> ” (paragraph 15, p. 4). However, it is a fact that in some points of the document the distinction between these statuses is no longer made. It is best to show this by example. For example, the signatories to the agreement declare in it (paragraph 13 h, p. 21) that they want to “ <em>protect and respect the rights and best interests of the child at all times, regardless of their migration status, by ensuring the availability of viable alternatives to detention in detention facilities. Priority is given to community-based care, ensuring access to education and health care, and respecting the right of children to family life and family unity (...)</em> ”.<em> </em>According to this point, it should not matter to states whether a child entered the country legally or illegally. What matters is the best interests of the child and states should treat both types of child migrants equally.</p><p> Now to the very core of our assessment, namely the question of whether similar objections to those of the ODS leader are also being raised in other European countries.</p><p> Looking at neighboring <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/2638163-viden-neprijme-globalni-pakt-osn-o-migraci-odmitame-spojovat-ochranu-s-ekonomickou\">Austria</a> , for example, Austrian Chancellor Kurz announced that his country would not join the Global Compact. He stated that the Global Compact does not help to solve migration issues, threatens Austrian sovereignty in matters of migration policy, and blurs the distinction between legal and illegal migration. Austria also raised <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-migrants-austria/austria-has-concerns-about-u-n-migration-pact-might-back-out-idUSKCN1MK2EJ\">doubts about the interpretation of</a> certain passages, for example whether the compact can be interpreted as a provision on migration as a human right.</p><p> <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/polsky-ministr-vnitra-chce-odstoupit-od-globalni-dohody-osn/r~12457374cbdd11e8b295ac1f6b220ee8/\">Poland</a> has also announced its intention not to join the Global Compact. Polish Interior Minister Brudzinski stated that the reasons for this step were that &quot; <em>in our opinion, the draft agreement does not guarantee Poland&#39;s security. Moreover, it may increase illegal migration</em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> The document is also being discussed in <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/488421-migracni-pakt-se-prici-i-casti-cdu-angely-merkelove.html\">Germany</a> . The opposition AfD party, for example, is against its adoption, but there are also critical voices from the ruling CDU/CSU. For example, MP Wendt is concerned about the lack of distinction between refugees and labor migration, while his colleague Mitsch is concerned that the Global Pact &quot; <em>will curtail Germany&#39;s sovereignty in migration issues</em> .&quot;</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2018/11/13/global-compact-for-migration-sound-and-fury/#77b11fd1297a\">Doubts</a> about the interpretation were also voiced in <a href=\"https://news.err.ee/876709/estonia-200-political-declaration-must-be-added-to-migration-compact\">Estonia</a> , where some political parties demanded that the government clarify the country&#39;s political position, i.e. prevent abuse of the ambiguous pact. <a href=\"https://domov.sme.sk/c/20954985/sns-pakt-o-migracii-osn-parlament-narodna-rada.html\">The Slovak discussion</a> then shows the uncertainty of individual parties and politicians regarding how the Pact can be understood and what obligations it brings to the signatories.</p><p></p>\nSECTION E: <p>Petr Fiala answered <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/221411030501017/#t=48m28s\">a question</a> in Václav Moravec&#39;s Questions (video, time 48:28) that mentioned that more than a million voters lost their votes in the parliamentary elections, and are therefore not represented in the Chamber of Deputies. Petr Fiala stated (time 49:22) that <i>&quot;good government governs for everyone, even for those who did not vote for it&quot;</i> . He then illustrates this position by referring to his older statement from the election staff, which is the content of the verified statement.</p><p> Petr Fiala, in the SPOLU coalition&#39;s election staff, gave his first post-election speech on October 9, when <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3383514-zmeny-je-tady-my-jsme-ji-slibili-my-ji-udelame-rekl-lidr-spolu-fiala\">he said</a> (video, time 1:52): <i>&quot;(…) I would like to ask you something in this context.

The part of the statement regarding the 2018 Senate elections can also be considered completely true.

    "Determine whether the statement relevant to the given summary is TRUE or FALSE based on a summary and a number of statements. Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: Václav MORAVEC: Well, the Germans were not accused by Russia. Richard BRABEC: No, but we were, we also made a very strong statement. The government clearly said that it was nonsense, it rejected it, even, if I&#39;m not mistaken, Minister Stropnický invited the Russian ambassador to the carpet, where he very clearly told him that this was simply unacceptable. And I don&#39;t think there was any debate about it there. We rejected it, as a government we clearly reject it, it was nonsense, it never happened.\nSECTION B: This is a specific change to the law that the government approved today, although it is just one word, but it is quite significant because it means that Andrej Babiš will no longer chair the Council for European Funds, (...) which recommends systemic solutions to the government, for example in terms of drawing down European funds, or is responsible for the implementation and the relationship between individual programs and the drawing down of funds for individual program objectives.\nSECTION C: I remember, if I&#39;m not mistaken, sometime in October or September 2017, Minister of Agriculture Jureček presented the government with material that he basically put on the table, it was only a few pages and said that a bark beetle disaster was approaching or that there was a real one. The government then more or less said yes, and set out some further course of action.\nSECTION D: If you look at, for example, the dean of the Faculty of Forestry of the Czech University of Life Sciences, Mr. Turčáni, and his statement, he also says that they, as forest experts or some of the forest experts, warned the Forests of the Czech Republic around 2016 that all the conditions for the gradation of the bark beetle, or rather for the unmanageable increase of the bark beetle calamity, were met here, and that there was no adequate response.\nSECTION E: The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the forests of national parks and there, although at that time, and you may remember, there was a huge debate about the impending bark beetle disaster in Šumava. At that time, the bark beetle was already eating the commercial forests, where intervention was not only possible, but even necessary, and a number of politicians were dealing with Šumava or national parks, where there was no bark beetle disaster.\nSECTION F: And unfortunately, and all experts agree on this today, many of them have said it before, but they probably weren&#39;t really listened to, they said that in a situation where there is a threat, of course, when, or if there is more frequent drought, there will be long periods of drought, then the spruce, which is classically an ideal tree for, let&#39;s say, a more humid climate, where it still has water, not a lot, but it still has some, let&#39;s say, milder precipitation and on top of that it simply has cold winters, then it is simply, then it is an ideal tree.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
