Heredity and variability


Basic concepts and methods of genetics

What methods of reproduction exist in living organisms? Why do children resemble their parents? Why do siblings have different appearances? Which organisms are called haploid and which are diploid?


What does genetics study? Genetics is the science that studies the heredity and variability of living organisms. This name for this science was proposed by the English scientist W. Bateson (1906). Heredity is the ability of organisms in the process of ontogenesis to form signs (characteristic features, etc.) that are characteristic of parental organisms and more distant ancestors. Examples of hereditary signs are the red hair color that children receive from their parents, the same number of wings and the peculiarities of their structure in different generations of the Drosophila fly, the same shape and color of fruits of a certain variety (Fig. 26.1). Fig. 26.1.

106. Heredity and variability


Variability is the property of an organism to form a unique phenotype (a set of characteristics characteristic of an individual at a certain stage of development) in the process of ontogenesis. Examples of variability are the appearance of four-lobed clover leaves, the birth of a white crow from gray parents, the dissimilarity of siblings in the same family.


Basic concepts of genetics The list of basic concepts in genetics includes gene, genome, genotype, phenotype, dominant and recessive alleles. A gene is a separate section of DNA that is responsible for the formation of one or more traits of an organism. The set of genetic information of a somatic cell of an organism is called a genotype. The genotype includes both nuclear and extranuclear genes that are part of mitochondria, plastids or plasmids (for example, in yeast). Often, a genotype is called a set of alleles of only those genes that are considered in a particular study or in a particular problem. The concept of a genome seems similar to a genotype. But, in fact, these are different concepts. By definition, a genome is the set of all hereditary information of an organism, including both genes and non-coding DNA regions. The genome itself is a list of all genes and non-coding DNA regions of the nuclear haploid set of chromosomes and DNA of extrachromosomal elements (in eukaryotes) and all DNA contained in the cell (in prokaryotic organisms). The set of properties and signs of an organism that are formed as a result of the interaction of the genotype with the external environment is called the phenotype. The phenotype never fully reflects the genotype. It reveals only that part of it that is realized in certain conditions of existence. The concept of an allele is very important for understanding the basics of genetics.
An allele is one of the possible states (variants) of a gene.
Different genes can have several such variants. There are genes that are represented by only one variant (allele). There are also genes with two, three or many alleles. Different alleles of one gene are always located on the same section of the chromosome. The location of a gene on a chromosome is called a locus. As you know, in diploid organisms, chromosomes are homologous (each chromosome is represented by two copies). For such organisms, the concepts of homozygote, heterozygote, and hemizygote are used. If the alleles of one gene, located in different homologous chromosomes, are the same, the organism is called homozygote (for


a


specific gene). If the alleles in homologous chromosomes are different, it is heterozygote. If only one allele of a gene is present in a pair of chromosomes (usually this happens in sex chromosomes), it is hemizygote. The basic concepts of genetics also include the concepts of dominance and recessivity, which determine the form of the relationship between different alleles of one gene. In such a relationship, one of the alleles (dominant) masks the manifestation of the other allele (recessive) in the heterozygote.


Methods of genetic research Genetics uses a large number of methods for conducting research, the main of which are considered hybridological, genealogical, population-statistical, cytogenetic, biochemical, and twin. These methods are traditional and have been used for many years.


Classical methods of genetic research


Name
Essence of the method


GenealogicalThe study of the pedigrees of organisms (Fig. 26.2). This makes it possible to trace the nature of inheritance of different states of certain traits in a number of generations


Population-statisticalEstablishment of the frequency of occurrence of alleles in populations of organisms and the genetic structure of populations


HybridologicalCrossing (hybridization) of organisms that differ in certain states of one or more hereditary traits. Offspring obtained from such a crossing are called hybrids


CytogeneticThe study of the chromosome set (karyotype) of organisms (Fig. 26.3)


BiochemicalThe study of the features of biochemical processes in organisms with different genotypes


TwinThe study of monozygotic twins (organisms that originate from one zygote) and their comparison with dizygotic twins (which are formed from different zygotes). By studying such
organisms, it is possible to find out the role of environmental factors in the formation of
the phenotype of individuals: the different nature of their influence determines the differences in the manifestation of certain states of certain traits. This method makes it possible to determine the role of heredity and environment in the development of various traits and diseases

In recent years, relatively new methods of molecular biology have become the most widespread: gene sequencing, polymerase chain reaction, and the use of genetic markers. They are based on the latest technologies and allow us to significantly increase the efficiency of genetic research. After all, they work directly with DNA, which stores hereditary information.


Monozygotic twins are always of the same sex. They have the same blood type, are very similar to each other, and make up approximately 1/3 of all twins born. Dizygotic twins are genetically similar as brothers and sisters and can be both same-sex and different-sex. TOPIC 3


Laws of heredity. Hybridological analysis


27


Who formulated the laws of heredity? What designations are used in drawing up a cross-breeding scheme? Which alleles of genes are called dominant and which are recessive?


Laws of heredityThe basic laws of heredity were formulated by Gregor Mendel in the middle of the 19th century. He presented them in the form of several laws. In addition, he created the scientific basis of modern hybridological analysis.


Hybridological analysis and the main types of crossesHybridological analysis is the study of the nature of inheritance of traits using a system of crosses. It is based on hybridization, which consists in crossing organisms that differ from each other in one or more hereditary traits, for example, in the color of seeds, the shape of wings, the length of legs, etc. The offspring obtained from such a cross are called hybrids. To conduct experiments in genetics and selection, scientists cross organisms and study the parent organisms and organisms of the first, second and subsequent generations. Depending on the number of genes being analyzed, there are monohybrid (one gene), dihybrid (two genes) and polyhybrid (many genes) crosses.


Analytical crosses In the course of genetics research, so-called analytical crosses are often carried out. Analytical crosses are crosses between an individual with an unknown genotype and an individual homozygous for the recessive alleles of all the genes being studied (see p. 113). Let us consider it using a specific example. Such a cross allows us to identify heterozygous individuals, because in the case of crossing with them a homozygous recessive form, splitting will be observed in the ratio 1:1 among the descendants of the first generation. And if the individual under study
was a dominant homozygous, then splitting
will not be observed (according to the rule of uniformity of first-generation hybrids).

Modern molecular genetic methods of studying human heredity


28


What methods of molecular biology do you know? What nucleotides are part of DNA? How does the replication process occur, and which enzyme carries it out?


Modern molecular genetic research methodsMolecular genetic research methods for human heredity work mainly with DNA and protein molecules. They use the biochemical properties of these molecules, primarily the fact that DNA and proteins are biopolymers. They are widely used in various scientific research and in medicine.Modern molecular genetic methods can be conditionally divided into several groups: isolation and purification of the desired molecules, amplification (copying) of DNA,
hybridization,
data processing and modeling.Usually, all these methods are used in combination. The most common technologies currently include DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction, genetic markers and DNA microarray.


DNA sequencing The DNA sequencing method consists in determining the sequence of nucleotide bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) in a certain section of DNA for further identification of such a section and clarification of the composition of RNA and proteins that can be encoded on it. The number of nucleotide bases in eukaryotic DNA is very large, therefore it is determined using special devices - sequencers (Fig. 28.1),


which

this process automatically. This allowed the Human Genome Project to sequence the DNA of all human chromosomes, although the total size of its genome is 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs. DNA sequencing is widely used for the diagnosis of hereditary diseases and in forensic medicine to identify individuals or identify biological material.

Fig. 28.2. Scheme of the polymerase chain reaction


Polymerase chain reaction Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method that allows all other DNA processing technologies to work more efficiently. Its main task is to increase the number of DNA molecules needed for their analysis. If the molecules of the DNA under study are not enough for analysis, then using PCR, their number can be increased millions of times. And after that, this DNA can be analyzed using any method. PCR uses the principle of DNA complementarity. This reaction is carried out by the polymerase enzyme, which performs the replication process in the cell. It attaches to a designated place on the DNA strand and synthesizes a copy of one of its sections. To mark the place where
the polymerase begins synthesis, special short
DNA chains are used — primers, which are determined by the researcher. After synthesis, the temperature of the solution is first increased. High temperature destroys hydrogen bonds, causing the old and new DNA strands to separate. The polymerase does not work at this time. Then the temperature is lowered, and the polymerase can work again. After this, a new cycle of synthesis begins, but now on two DNA strands (Fig. 28.2). After repeating this cycle 30–40 times, the amount of DNA becomes sufficient for analysis, even if the sample initially contained only one DNA molecule. This technology is widely used in the diagnosis of various diseases and in forensic medicine. In addition, PCR can be used to extract DNA from the bones of extinct organisms, which makes it possible to read their genomes. This is how the Neanderthal genome was read.


115. TOPIC 3


Application of genetic markers The method of genetic markers consists in identifying certain genes, DNA sections, chromosomes, or individual individuals of a species using nucleotide combinations inherent only to them. Genetic markers (or DNA markers) are polymorphic (those that have several variants) traits that are detected at the level of the nucleotide sequence of DNA during research. In this way, it is determined which of the marker variants are present in certain individuals of a population, and thanks to this, it is possible to find out the structure and history of this population and compare it with other populations. Most often,
DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction are used to detect genetic markers.
Genetic markers can be located in exons or introns of structural or regulatory genes. They can also occur in non-coding regions of the human genome, such as inverted repeats, microsatellite loci, etc. These markers are widely used in population studies. Their study allows us to establish family relationships between different human populations and their development history (including migrations and interbreeding with other groups).


Fig. 28.3. Placing DNA probes on


a DNA microchip glass plate The DNA microchip method determines which genes in a cell are working. In addition, it allows you to assess the level of gene activity (which of them works more and which less intensively). The essence of the DNA microchip method is that a large number of probes are placed on a special plate (using a complex robotic mechanism) - small DNA molecules with which RNA molecules present in the cells under study interact (Fig. 28.3). The probes can be genes of both the entire genome (up to 40 thousand of them can be placed on one glass plate) and a certain part of it that is involved in the study. The location of each probe on the plate is clearly defined, which is very important for analyzing the interaction of RNA molecules with probes, because such analysis is carried out automatically using a special device. All RNA of the cells under study is labeled with special signal molecules,

Fig. 28.5. The result of the DNA microchip method is the detection of complexes of RNA and DNA probes


that provide their coloring. If the cells under study are destroyed and the resulting solution is poured onto the surface of the board, then all RNAs will interact with the probes that correspond to them (Fig. 28.4). After washing the board, when all unnecessary molecules are removed, the laser detector will easily find signal molecules attached to RNA molecules that have bound to the probes of the corresponding genes, and it will be possible to determine which genes in the cells are working (Fig. 28.5). This technology allows, for example, to find out which genes in a cancer cell work and which do not, compared to a healthy one, or which genes are "turned off" (stop working) or change their activity in the case of a certain hereditary disease..TOPIC 3


Organization of the hereditary material
of a eukaryotic cell


29


What is a gene? What is a genome? Which organisms are classified as prokaryotic and which as eukaryotic? In which cell structures is the hereditary material located in eukaryotes? What is the structure of a gene? What functions do the gene structures - promoter and terminator - perform?


Nucleosome


Histones


DNA


Features of eukaryotic genomes. Nuclear genome Eukaryotic genomes are divided into two large parts - nuclear and extranuclear. The main part of eukaryotic genes is concentrated in the nuclear part of the genome. The nuclear part is the genes located in the chromosomes of the cell nucleus. Chromosomes are complex complexes consisting of a linear DNA molecule and a large number of special histone proteins. These proteins allow the DNA molecule to be placed very compactly. They form nucleosomes - circular structures around which the DNA strand wraps (Fig. 29.1). In addition, they play an important role in regulating the work of genes. A characteristic feature of eukaryotes is that most of the DNA in their genomes is non-coding regions,
that is, regions that do not contain
working genes. At first, such DNA was called junk, because it was thought that the body did not need it. But then it turned out that it can play an important role in regulating the work of the genome and evolutionary processes. However, the role of these DNA regions has not yet been fully elucidated. Another characteristic feature of the genomes of eukaryotic organisms is the presence of long regions of repeated nucleotide sequences of various lengths. Their functions are still insufficiently understood.


Fig. 29.1. Interaction of DNA with nucleosomes


118. Heredity and variability


Extranuclear genome of eukaryotes The extranuclear part of the genome is the genes located in plastids and mitochondria (Fig. 29.2). The DNA molecule of these organelles has the shape of a ring, it is not associated with proteins (does not contain histones) and is very similar in structure to the bacterial chromosome. One mitochondrion or plastid can contain several copies of this DNA molecule. Some eukaryotes (for example, yeast) can also have plasmids (small circular DNA molecules) in their cells. The DNA molecules of plastids and mitochondria contain almost no non-coding regions. They contain genes that produce substances necessary for the functioning of these organelles (Fig. 29.3). However, not all genes whose products are involved in the work of mitochondria and plastids are located in the extranuclear genome. For example, human mitochondria contain only 37 genes, but most of the genes necessary
for the work of mitochondria are contained in the nuclear part of the genome.
In the genomes of eukaryotes, there are mobile genetic elements (mobile genes), which are able to move within the genome. These genes are not structural or regulatory and are often considered as intragenomic parasites.


The size of the genome of eukaryotes The size of the genome of an organism is determined by the total number of DNA nucleotide pairs that make up its composition. The smallest genome size is in viruses. It can be less than 2 thousand nucleotide pairs. In more complex organisms, the genome is also larger. For example, in the bacterium Escherichia coli, nucleotide pairs are 4.6 million.

Fig. 29.4. Size of genomes of different groups of organisms


But the largest are the genomes of eukaryotes (Fig. 29.4). Thus, the size
of the genome in yeast is 12.1 million, in the fruit fly Drosophila - 175 million,
and in humans - 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs. The presence of a large number of non-coding regions also affects the increase in their size. The number of genes in the genomes of different organisms also varies: in the simplest viruses - 2-3, in bacteria - several thousand. Eukaryotes have the largest number of genes: in poplar - 73 thousand, in silkworm - 14 thousand, in humans - over 20 thousand. The number of genes in the genomes of many eukaryotes could increase due to polyploidization, during which the number of chromosomes increases many times due to their doubling.


Genes of eukaryotes


Genes of eukaryotes have a complex structure. This structure is best described by the exon-intron model (Fig. 29.5). Eukaryotic genes are divided into certain sections, including a promoter and a terminator, and usually several exons and introns.


Regulatory sequence… PromoterExon 1Intron 1Exon 2Intron 2Exon 3Terminator


Fig. 29.5. Structure of a eukaryotic gene


120. Heredity and variability


Introns are sequences of nucleotides that do not contain information necessary for the synthesis of the gene product (i.e., a protein or RNA molecule), and exons are sections of DNA that contain such information. In eukaryotes, during the implementation of hereditary information, the first RNA molecule is synthesized, which contains copies of all sections — both exons and introns. After this, the process of its maturation occurs, during which intron sections are removed from RNA. An important part of eukaryotic genes are regulatory sections, with the help of which the cell can accelerate or slow down gene synthesis. This structure allows eukaryotic organisms to carry out very fine regulation of the work of their genes. The regions that accelerate the work of a gene are called enhancers, and those that slow down or stop it are called silencers.


The number of introns in one gene can vary from zero to several dozen. And the length of individual introns is from several pairs to several thousand pairs of nucleotides.


In the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax, the number of chromosomes is approximately 16,000. But the size of these chromosomes is very small. In the large nucleus of its cell (macronucleus), approximately 2,000 copies of the genome are located. Thus, the total number of chromosomes in the macronucleus is several million. The total number of genes in the genome of this species is approximately 18,000. Therefore, most chromosomes contain only one gene, and the largest number of genes in one chromosome is 8. In an ordinary ciliate (Paramecium), the nucleus contains approximately 200 chromosomes. TOPIC 3


Structural and regulatory genes.
Regulation of gene activity


30


How is hereditary information implemented in eukaryotes? What are transcription and translation? How does RNA maturation occur? What is splicing and where does it occur? What proteins are complex?


Structural and regulatory genes By function, genes of living organisms can be divided into two large groups: structural and regulatory. Structural genes contain information about the structure of protein and RNA molecules that make up organelles or the cytoplasm of cells. Many of these proteins and RNAs participate in the formation of cell structures, which gave the name to this type of genes. This group also includes genes for enzymes and substances that the cell secretes into the environment (for example, mucus or nectar substances). Regulatory genes also contain information about the structure of protein or RNA molecules. But their task is to regulate the work of structural genes. They can speed it up or slow it down. Or even completely stop the synthesis of a gene product that the cell does not need for a certain time. These genes can act at different stages of the synthesis of gene products. They are able to influence both the synthesis or maturation of RNA and protein synthesis.


Why is gene regulation necessary? The genome of eukaryotes contains several thousand genes, but each individual cell needs much fewer genes to function and perform its functions. For example, in mammals, the optic nerve cell does not need to produce salivary enzymes or sex hormones, and the muscle cell does not need to synthesize hemoglobin. Therefore, most of the genes in the cells are inactive, "turned off." But even those genes that do not always work must work
equally intensively. If there is a need to produce digestive enzymes, then
the genes that produce them work actively. And when the need disappears, the intensity of their work should be reduced. In this way, cells save the body's resources.

A characteristic feature of eukaryotes
is that the number of genes in them is
smaller (often much smaller) than the number of proteins synthesized in their cells. This became possible due to the fact that the organism can obtain several functional products (protein molecules) from one gene. It is precisely to solve the listed problems that mechanisms for regulating the implementation of hereditary information are needed. Eukaryotes carry out such regulation extremely effectively.


Fig. 30.1. Gene expression in eukaryotes


Gene expression Gene expression changes as a result of the action of regulatory mechanisms. Gene expression is the process by which the hereditary information of a particular gene is used to synthesize its product (protein or RNA molecule) (Fig. 30.1). If expression increases, more of the product is synthesized, and if it decreases, less of the product is synthesized. Expression can change both directly (through the action of regulatory genes) and indirectly (as a side effect of the action of another gene, for example, in the event of insufficient synthesis of a substance that is a substrate for the enzyme).


Regulation of gene activity In cells, the regulation of the implementation of genetic information can occur using several mechanisms. They act at different levels of the implementation of hereditary information: at the chromatin level, during transcription, during RNA maturation and transport, during translation,
after the completion of translation (post-translational modification).
Regulation at the chromatin level This type of regulation can be carried out in two ways - structural and chemical (Fig. 30.2). Structural regulation is carried out by packaging certain DNA sections with the help of proteins in such a way that hereditary information cannot be read from them.

Fig. 30.2. Regulation of gene work at the chromatin level


. Thus, chromosomes distinguish between heterochromatin (densely packed) and euchromatin (not densely packed) sections. Transcription is possible on euchromatin sections, but not on heterochromatin sections.
Chemical regulation occurs by modifying certain
nucleotides in DNA chains. If a methyl radical (CH 3 ) is added to them, then reading information from such a DNA section becomes impossible. Another method of chemical regulation is the acetylation of histone proteins, around which DNA strands in chromosomes are wound. The presence of an additional acetyl group in them also makes it impossible to read information from the section.


Regulation at the transcriptional level During transcription, gene activity is regulated as a result of the interaction of regulatory gene products (usually proteins) with certain gene structures: a promoter or regulatory regions. This allows you to change the speed of gene activity or “turn them on” or “turn them off”.


Regulation during RNA maturation and translation As you know, in eukaryotes, processing (RNA maturation) occurs after transcription. It occurs in the cell nucleus, when introns are removed and exons are combined and joined to each other. During processing, the processes of cutting out introns, “stitching” exons (splicing) and adding certain structures to the beginning and end of the RNA molecule occur.


124. Heredity and variability


Alternative splicing is possible for most genes — obtaining several possible RNA variants from a molecule synthesized during transcription. Regulation during translation occurs mainly at the initiation stage.
At this point, various factors can
join mRNA and block the synthesis of a protein molecule or, conversely, start it.


Fig. 30.3. Variants of the formation of different proteins from one molecule due to the work of a chaperone protein


Post-translational regulation Usually this process occurs in the form of post-translational modification. Post-translational modification is a change in a protein molecule after its formation during translation. It is carried out by special proteins. For example, proteins - chaperones form the spatial structure of a protein, modifying its secondary and tertiary structure (Fig. 30.3). Other proteins can add a non-protein part to the molecule of complex proteins (for example, heme in the hemoglobin molecule).


The genes of eukaryotes, which are necessary for maintaining basic vital functions and which are actively working in almost all cells of the body, have received a special name - "housekeeping genes". These are genes that synthesize products necessary for the reproduction and implementation of hereditary information, the implementation of basic metabolic processes and the life cycle of the cell..TOPIC 3


The concept of karyotype. Chromosomes. Chromosomal analysis


31


Where are chromosomes located? Which cells are called
sex cells and which are somatic cells? Does the number of chromosomes differ
in sex cells and somatic cells?


Chromosomal theory of heredity The chromosome theory of heredity was proposed almost immediately after the rediscovery of G. Mendel's laws. It was proposed by T. Boveri and V. Sutton (1902–1903). But it acquired its modern form somewhat later thanks to the works of T. H. Morgan and his colleagues. This theory allowed scientists to focus their attention on the cell nucleus as a place of storage of hereditary information and on chromosomes as carriers of this information. The main provisions of the chromosome theory of heredity: Genes are contained in chromosomes. Each pair of chromosomes is a linkage group of genes. The number of linkage groups is equal to the haploid number of chromosomes. Genes are located linearly in the chromosome. Crossing over (exchange of sections between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes) can occur between homologous chromosomes. The frequency of crossing over is directly proportional to the distance between genes.

Fig. 31.1. Structure of a chromosome


Each chromosome is a long DNA molecule that forms a complex complex with histone proteins. For most of their existence, chromosomes are in an uncondensed state and have the appearance of thin threads. Only during cell division do they condense and form clearly defined chromosomes. During cell division, almost all chromosomes have an X-shaped shape (Fig. 31.1). This


126. Heredity and variability

Sex chromosomes


Autosomes


Fig. 31.2. Idiogram of the human karyotype (autosomes are represented by
one chromosome from each pair)


shape is due to the fact that at this moment each chromosome consists of two identical threads (chromatids), which are connected to each other in one area, which is called the centromere, and parts of the chromatids from this area to their ends are called arms. The end sections of the arms of chromosomes are called telomeres. The arms can be approximately the same or different in length. In this case, a long and short arm of the chromosome are distinguished. In most eukaryotes, each chromosome has a paired homologous chromosome. Homologous chromosomes duplicate each other. In each chromosome of such a pair, identical regions are allelic genes.


Karyotype The set of all chromosomes of a cell forms its chromosome set. The set of features of this set (number and shape of chromosomes, location of centromeres, etc.), which allows it to be identified, is called a karyotype. The karyotype can be depicted in the form of a diagram - an idiogram (karyogram), on which the chromosomes are arranged in order of decreasing length. The karyotype is one of the criteria of a species, which allows determining the belonging of individuals to it. The human karyotype contains 22 pairs of autosomes (Fig. 31.2) and two sex chromosomes (XX in women and XY in men).


Sex and non-sex chromosomes Sex chromosomes can be of one or two types. If
a species has sex chromosomes of the same type, then the sex of an individual is
determined by how many sex chromosomes are in its chromosome set - one or two. If there are two types of sex chromosomes, then one sex has two identical sex chromosomes (homogametic sex), and the other has two different ones (heterogametic sex). For example, in humans and dipterans, the homogametic sex is female (its representatives have two X chromosomes, genotype - XX), and the heterogametic sex is male (its representatives have one X and one

chromosome, genotype - XY). In most birds and butterflies, on the contrary, the homogametic sex is male (its representatives have two identical chromosomes, but they are designated by a different Latin letter - Z, genotype - ZZ), and the heterogametic sex is female (genotype - ZW).


Ploidy of chromosome sets In most cells of eukaryotic organisms, all chromosomes are present in the form of homologous pairs. However, in the sex cells that these organisms form, chromosomes are presented in only one copy, without their homologous pair. Such a set of chromosomes is called haploid. The chromosome set of somatic cells is called diploid. This is due to the peculiarities of sexual reproduction. During this process, a new organism is formed as a result of the fusion of two sex cells of its parents. If there were no decrease in the number of chromosomes in sex cells, then each subsequent generation would have twice as many chromosomes as their parents. In nature, there are cases when the number of chromosomes in some individual cells or entire organisms changes a multiple of times. This phenomenon is called polyploidy. Scientists quite often find triploid (with three sets of chromosomes), tetraploid (with four sets), hexaploid (with six sets) organisms. Organisms with even higher
ploidy also occur.
Sometimes the change in ploidy does not affect all chromosomes, but only individual pairs. For example, only one chromosome is added or removed. This phenomenon is called aneuploidy (Fig. 31.3). Absence

Chromosomal analysis Chromosomal analysis is widely used in scientific research, selection and medicine (in the latter - for the diagnosis of hereditary diseases). Chromosome analysis is the process of studying and analyzing the number and structural features of chromosomes of a certain karyotype. During such analysis, a specific karyotype is compared with the normal karyotype of a certain species. It is found out whether the ploidy of the set has changed. The absence of certain chromosomes or, conversely, the presence of extra ones is detected. Important information for chromosome analysis is provided by the technology of differential chromosome staining (Fig. 31.4). Due to the heterogeneity of DNA packaging in its different areas, the treatment of chromosomes with special dyes stains these areas differently. And the location of zones of different colors on chromosomes is unique for each species of organisms. Analysis of stained chromosomes makes it quite easy to establish the loss or duplication of chromosome sections or their rotation by 180 °.

Mutations and their properties


32


What substance stores the hereditary information of organisms? What structural features are inherent in this substance? What nucleotides are in the composition of living organisms? What is the difference between male and female gametes?


Mutations and their properties A mutation (from the Latin mutatio - change) is a change in a trait that is caused by violations of hereditary structures, a restructuring of the genetic apparatus. Mutations change the genotype of an individual. They arise suddenly and cause the appearance of traits in the organism that differ from the original form. Scientists have known such changes for a long time. Hugo de Vries (Fig. 32.1) proposed the term "mutation". In addition, he formulated the basic principles of the theory of mutations (1901–1903), indicating their main properties: mutations arise suddenly, as discrete changes in traits; new forms are stable; unlike non-hereditary variability, mutations do not form continuous series and do not concentrate around some average type; they are qualitative changes; mutations manifest themselves in different ways; they can be both harmful and beneficial; the probability of detecting mutations depends on the number of individuals studied; the same mutations can occur repeatedly.


Classifications of mutations


There are several variants of the classification of mutations: by the type of manifestation of the trait in a heterozygote: dominant (cause the appearance of a dominant trait) and recessive (cause the appearance of a recessive trait);


Fig. 32.1. Hugo de Vries (1848–1935), Dutch botanist, geneticist


130. Heredity and variability


by localization in the cell: nuclear (change genes located in the cell nucleus) and cytoplasmic (change genes located in the cell cytoplasm); depending on the cause of occurrence: spontaneous (the causes of their occurrence have not yet been established) and induced (arise as a result of the action of external factors on the genetic material); by the type of cells in which they occur: somatic (in somatic) and generative (in gametes); somatic mutations can be transmitted to offspring only under the condition of vegetative reproduction, generative mutations - under the condition of normal sexual reproduction.


Point, chromosomal and genomic mutations One of the most common classifications of mutations is their distribution according to the level of organization of the hereditary material at which the mutation occurs. According to this classification, mutations are divided into point (gene), chromosomal and genomic.


Classification of mutations according to the level of organization of
hereditary material


Type of mutations What changes do they cause What are they Examples of mutations


Point (gene) Replacement, loss or addition of a pair of nucleotides. Only one gene is changed


Nonsense mutations — cause a stop codon to appear inside the mRNA that encodes a protein molecule. Missense mutations — change one amino acid in a protein molecule to another. Silent mutations — do not cause an amino acid substitution in the molecule


Duchenne muscular dystrophy — a nonsense mutation that blocks protein synthesis in the muscles and causes their degradation.
Sickle cell
anemia — a missense mutation in which one of the glutamine molecules in the hemoglobin molecule is replaced by valine.


Cat's cry syndrome — a hereditary human disease resulting from the loss of a section of the fifth chromosome


. Chromosomes Replacement, loss, addition, or change in the location of a section of a chromosome. Can change or disrupt the work of several genes


Deletion - loss of a chromosome section. Duplication - doubling of a chromosome section. Inversion - turning a chromosome section by 180 °. Translocation - transfer of a section to another (non-homologous to it) chromosome

Types of mutations What changes cause What occur Examples of mutations


Down syndrome - a hereditary human disease due to trisomy in the 21st pair of chromosomes


Polyploidy, heteroploidy, monosomy Robertsonian translocation - the union of two chromosomes into one


Genomic A change in the number of individual chromosomes or the entire chromosome set. Can disrupt the work of hundreds and thousands of genes


Mutagenic factors Factors that are capable of inducing a mutational effect are called
mutagenic. It has been established that any factors of the external and
internal environment that can disrupt homeostasis can cause mutations. Traditionally, they are divided into three large groups: physical, chemical and biological.


Groups of mutagenic factors


The most common factors of the group Mechanism of action

Physical X-ray and ultraviolet radiation, high temperature, ultrasound


DNA strands break, its structure is disrupted; free radicals (molecules or atoms that have one or two unpaired electrons) are formed in the cell, which interact with nucleotides and proteins of chromosomes


DNA strands break, its structure is disrupted; individual nucleotides react with various substances


Chemical Formaldehyde, colchicine, chloroform, dioxin, compounds of lead, mercury, alcohol, narcotic substances


Biological Measles, influenza viruses and others; toxins produced by living organisms, mobile genetic elements


Toxins act by the same mechanism as chemical mutagens. Viruses can integrate into the DNA of a cell after penetrating it (Fig. 32.2). If they integrate into a region of a working gene, they disrupt its work. Mobile genetic elements are sections of DNA that are able to move independently within a chromosome or between different chromosomes. If they enter a region of a working gene, they disrupt its work

The cephalopod mollusk nautilus has eyes of a rather complex structure, very similar in structure to the eyes of its relatives - octopuses and squids. But there is a significant difference in their structure. The nautilus' eyes lack a lens, which makes its vision significantly worse. This feature arose due to a mutation in one of the regulatory genes responsible for eye development. According to scientists, this mutation occurred more than 400 million years ago.


Mutagenic factors are widely used in breeding practice to obtain new varieties of plants and animal breeds (Fig. 32.3). Thus, plants are affected by critical temperatures, ionizing radiation, and chemicals (the most common is the alkaloid colchicine)..TOPIC 3

What substance in the cell is the carrier of hereditary information? In what form is hereditary information stored? What is replication?


Causes and possible consequences of DNA damage
A DNA molecule, like any other molecule, can be damaged
. These damages can be different. One nucleotide or a pair of nucleotides can be damaged. One of the DNA chains or even both chains at the same time can break. There can be quite a lot of reasons for such damage. DNA molecules are often damaged by ultraviolet and radioactive radiation. Some chemical compounds are a significant danger. In addition, the cause of damage can be an error during replication. For example, instead of one nucleotide, another can accidentally get into the chain. Although this happens very rarely. The consequences of such damage for cells can be negative. Genes whose structure is disrupted can stop producing their products - RNA or proteins. For example, as a result of damage, one of the codons inside the RNA molecule will not encode an amino acid, but a stop codon. Then only part of the protein molecule is synthesized. It is clear that such a molecule will not be able to work and perform its functions.


DNA repair processes In order to correct such errors, cells have a special mechanism. It is called DNA repair. DNA repair is a series of processes by which a cell finds and corrects damage to its DNA. These processes are carried out by complex enzyme complexes consisting of several proteins. Some of these proteins find the site of damage, others untangle this section of DNA and remove the incorrect nucleotide. And then the correct nucleotide is placed in this place. The repair system


134. Heredity and variability


considers the correct nucleotide to be the one located in the old DNA chain. Enzymes can recognize this chain by the “tags” on the nucleotides (some of them have methyl groups attached to them –CH 3 ).
For other types of DNA damage, there are also groups of enzymes
that find and correct them.


Protection of the human genome from harmful mutagenic effects There are several mechanisms to protect the human genome from the effects of mutagens. None of them provides a complete guarantee against damage, but together they significantly reduce the risk of the genome being damaged by mutagens.


The main mechanisms of protecting the human genome from the action of mutagens


Mechanism of protection Description of the mechanism's action


Adequate behavior Thanks to his mental activity, a person can determine situations when he may encounter the action of a mutagen, and avoid them. For example, do not visit places with an increased radiation background and do not consume substances containing chemical mutagens (alcoholic beverages, tobacco, drugs)


Body coverings The skin is a fairly reliable means of protection that prevents many types of mutagens (primarily chemical and biological) from entering the body


Protective substances Cells contain a large number of substances that can bind molecules of chemical mutagens (for example, ascorbic acid is able to bind free radicals). In this way, protective substances prevent
the contact of mutagens with the DNA of cells.


Genome structure Most of the DNA sections in the human genome, as in all eukaryotes, are non-coding. Therefore, their damage by mutagens does not have critical consequences.


Repair systems The DNA repair system in cells, described above, restores sections damaged by mutagens. TOPIC 3


Human Genome

What is a gene? What is a genome? What are the features of the genomes of eukaryotic organisms? How is the work of genes regulated in eukaryotic cells?


Fig. 34.1. James Watson (born 1928), American biologist, Nobel Prize laureate (1962) International Human Genome Project The development of molecular genetic technologies in the second half of the 20th century made it possible to study the human genome in detail. To carry out this research, the international


Human Genome Project
was created in 1990 .
The project was carried out under the leadership of James Watson (Fig. 34.1). In parallel, a similar project was carried out by the private company Celera Genomics under the leadership of Craig Venter (Fig. 34.2). The main task of the project was to determine the DNA sequence of human chromosomes and localize (determine the location) of all its genes. The main method used in these studies was sequencing of DNA molecules. The first incomplete version of the genome decoding was presented in 2000. The full version was in 2003. However, some DNA sections (centromeres and telomeres of chromosomes and some specific sections) still require additional research and cannot be considered completely deciphered. The largest volume of DNA sequencing within the project was carried out at universities in the USA, Canada and Great Britain.


Features of the human genome Research on the human genome made it possible to find out that 22 autosomes, sex chromosomes X and Y


Fig. 34.2. Craig Venter (born 1946), American biologist, geneticist, and entrepreneur


136. Heredity and variability


and mitochondrial DNA together contain approximately 3.234 billion
nucleotide pairs. The genome includes genes (some of which encode
proteins, and some of which encode RNA), regulatory sequences (they regulate the work of genes), repeats (DNA sequences that are repeated several times in a row), transposons (mobile genetic elements), pseudogenes, and viral DNA. The number of genes in the human genome turned out to be smaller than expected. While more than 100 thousand proteins were found in the human body, the genes that synthesize proteins turned out to be slightly more than 20 thousand. This became possible due to the fact that during the maturation of mRNA from one of its molecules, the cell can form several variants for the synthesis of different proteins. On average, the human body synthesizes 6 different proteins from each mRNA molecule. Transposons are DNA segments that are capable of independent movement (transposition) and reproduction within the genome. They can be considered as intragenomic parasites, because they do not synthesize useful products, but use the cell's resources for their own reproduction. Pseudogenes are non-working analogues of structural genes that have lost the ability to implement their genetic information. Most often, they arise by reverse transcription of RNA molecules. A pseudogene contains all the necessary information for the synthesis of the corresponding protein or RNA, but does not contain regulatory sequences. Therefore, it cannot reproduce this information.


The largest number of genes (2058) that encode proteins in humans is located on chromosome 1, and the smallest (13) is in mitochondrial DNA. Among the chromosomes, the smallest number of such genes (71) is located on the Y chromosome..TOPIC 3


Patterns of hereditary and non-hereditary human variability


35


What is heredity and variability? Where is
hereditary information stored in the human body? How many pairs of chromosomes do human cells contain? What is crossing over? In what cases do cells divide by meiosis?


Variety of forms of variabilityYou already know that variability is the property of living organisms to change. These changes can occur both with the organism itself during its existence and with the change of generations in each species of living organisms. Scientists distinguish two main forms of variability - hereditary (genotypic) and non-hereditary (modification, or phenotypic). Changes that occur in the case of hereditary variability are transmitted to descendants. And changes that occur in the case of non-hereditary variability are not transmitted to descendants. Hereditary variability, in turn, is divided into combinatorial and mutational. In combinatorial variability, the DNA structure does not change. Only recombination of alleles of different genes occurs. In mutational variability, the DNA structure changes. Scientists often distinguish ontogenetic variability as a separate type of variability. It occurs throughout the life of an individual under the control of genes. It is this variability that is responsible for the fact that the same person at the age of one, six, twenty and seventy looks completely different. Ontogenetic variability occurs in the cells of the body due to the regulation of gene work. The “switching on” and “switching off” of genes during human ontogenesis occurs taking into account specific conditions of existence. Therefore, even in monozygotic twins, the sets of active and inactive genes formed during life differ significantly from each other, although their genotypes at the time of blastomeres divergence and the formation of two embryos are identical.


Modification (phenotypic) variabilityNon-hereditary variability is also called phenotypic, or modification. Modifications are phenotypic changes that occur under the influence of environmental conditions. Modification changes in a trait are not inherited,


138
. Heredity and variability


Fig. 35.1. The size of the arm muscles under different physical loadsFig. 35.2. Change in bone structure as a result of metabolic disorders,


but its range (reaction rate) is genetically determined and inherited. Modification changes do not cause changes in the genotype. Modification variability corresponds to the conditions of existence, is adaptive. As a result of this variability, the intensity of enzymatic reactions in the organism changes, which is due to a change in the intensity of their biosynthesis. A characteristic feature of modification variability is reversibility - the disappearance of changes in the organism in the event of the disappearance of specific environmental conditions that led to the appearance of the modification. Examples of modification variability are: change in human body weight under the condition of a change in the amount of food; change in skin color in humans under the influence of sunlight; differences in muscle size under conditions of different physical loads (Fig. 35.1); restructuring of the structure of human bones under the influence of frequent loads or as a result of metabolic disorders (Fig. 35.2).


Combinatorial variabilityCombinatory variability is associated with obtaining new combinations of genes in the genotype. You are already well acquainted with this type of variability on the example of the laws of G. Mendel and the interaction of genes. In humans, combinatorial variability occurs during the processes: independent divergence of chromosomes during meiosis; random combination during fertilization; recombination of genes due to crossing over. The genes themselves do not change, but new
combinations of them arise, which causes the appearance of organisms with different genotypes and phenotypes
.

Hair of parentsHair of child


Fig. 35.3. The appearance of a new form of hair in a child compared to parents


Examples of combinatorial variability are: the birth of a child with II(A) blood group from parents with I(0) and IV(AB) blood groups; the birth of children with wavy hair from parents, one of whom has straight hair and the other has curly hair (Fig. 35.3).


Mutational variability Mutational variability occurs as a result of a violation of the DNA structure or hereditary structures of the cell (for example, a change in the number of chromosomes as a result of genomic mutations). You are already familiar with the causes of these disorders and the DNA repair mechanisms that allow you to eliminate such disorders. But if the repair mechanisms do not cope with the task, then a change in DNA occurs, which will be transmitted to descendants. A mutation will occur. It should be noted that in humans, only those mutations that arose in the germ cells will be transmitted to descendants. Mutational variability occurs in humans constantly. It often has important consequences. For example, the appearance of blond hair in Europeans
was due to a mutation that arose several thousand years ago
on the territory of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The mutation also resulted in the appearance of the ability to consume fresh milk in adulthood. In this case, the gene that was supposed to turn off the synthesis of the lactase enzyme stopped working. This mutation turned out to be useful and spread (Fig. 35.4). Different mutations in the human genome can sometimes have the same consequences. Thus, approximately 8% of the population of the Solomon Islands, located

in the Pacific Ocean have blond hair (Fig. 35.5). And carriers of this allele are 26% of the population. But this allele is not an allele of the gene responsible for blond hair in Europeans. Although this mutation also stops the synthesis of melanin in hair, it arose in a different gene.

Types of inheritance of traits in humans


36


Where is DNA located in the cells of the human body? How can different genes interact with each other? What laws did G. Mendel formulate? Which alleles are called dominant and which are recessive?


Mechanisms of inheritance of traits in humans The inheritance of various traits in humans can be ensured by various mechanisms. Some traits are monogenic (i.e. determined by the action of one gene). Their inheritance occurs according to the laws of G. Mendel and the chromosomal theory of heredity. Other traits can be formed as a result of the interaction of two or more genes. They are called polygenic, or multigenic. A significant part of them is the result of the interaction of a large number of genes. Extrachromosomal inheritance is also observed in humans. It is associated with genes located in mitochondrial DNA. These genes are responsible for the synthesis of RNA and proteins necessary for the functioning of mitochondria. In addition, mitochondrial DNA contains a small non-coding region (the so-called control region), which is widely used by geneticists in population genetic studies. This area is such a convenient object because all mutations that occur in it are neutral, and mitochondrial DNA itself is transmitted only through the female line. Such studies have been used, for example, to determine the sequence and time of settlement of various regions of the planet by ancient people.


Monogenic inheritance of traitsMonogenic traits in humans are inherited by several different mechanisms. The specific mechanism of inheritance of a trait depends on which chromosome (autosome or sex chromosome) the corresponding gene is located on and which (dominant or recessive)
the trait under study is. In addition, the manifestation of a gene can be influenced by the sex
of a person. Thus, the mammary glands are formed in both males and females. But they begin to develop only if the required level of female hormones is reached in the body during puberty.

Polygenic inheritance of traitsThere are many cases when a trait or properties of an organism are determined by two or more different genes that interact with each other. But it should be remembered that it is not the genes themselves that interact, but the protein or RNA molecules that they provide for their formation. During the interaction of non-allelic genes, a deviation from the Mendelian laws of splitting by phenotype in descendants occurs.
The following main types of gene interaction are distinguished: complementarity
, epistasis and polymerism. In addition, the modifying effect of a gene (pleiotropy), which is manifested in the determination of different traits by one gene, is considered separately. During complementary gene interaction, the development of a trait occurs only if each of the non-allelic genes has at least one dominant allele. In humans, hair shades are inherited by the mechanism of complementary interaction. In the case of epistatic gene interaction, the dominant or recessive allele of one gene suppresses the manifestation of the dominant allele of another gene. Accordingly, dominant and recessive epistasis are distinguished. For humans, an example of epistatic gene interaction is the action of the recessive allele of the Bombay gene, which blocks the formation of AB0 blood group antigens on the membranes of erythrocytes. In this case, a person has blood group I (0) regardless of his genotype. In the case of polymeric interaction of genes, the manifestation of a trait requires the presence of at least one dominant allele in any of several genes. These genes perform the same function (for example, ensure the synthesis of one pigment), but can be located in different chromosomes. They are called polymeric genes. Polymeric interaction


144. Heredity and variability


Fig. 36.4. African pygmies


genes can be of two types - non-cumulative (the degree of manifestation of the trait does not depend on the number of dominant alleles) and cumulative (the degree of manifestation of the trait is greater, the more dominant alleles). In humans, skin color is inherited by the mechanism of cumulative polymerization. An example of multigenic traits
that are formed as a result of the interaction
of a complex of genes is human height, although this trait can also change under the influence of a mutation of a single gene (for example, with insufficient synthesis of growth hormone), but in a normal situation it is influenced by a whole complex of genes. This is very clearly seen in the example of African pygmies (Fig. 36.4). For them, short stature was an important adaptation to life in the tropical forest. And to achieve this goal, alleles in several genes of the complex changed, which was determined by molecular biology methods. But by comparing the results of the study of two groups of pygmies from different regions, scientists proved that the height gene complexes of these groups of pygmies changed in different ways. Thus, to achieve one goal, a multigenic trait can change in different ways..TOPIC 3


Genetic monitoring in human communities


37


What are the methods of biological research? What is observation? What is monitoring? How does monitoring differ from an experiment? What are the methods of genetic research?


Features of human genetic monitoring Genetic monitoring is a system of observations aimed at tracking the occurrence and spread of hereditary disorders in populations. It provides systematic monitoring of the state of the gene pool of populations, makes it possible to assess the existing mutation process and predict its changes.
The genetic monitoring system began to develop in the 60s of
the 20th century after the so-called "thalidomide catastrophe", when the negative effect of the drug thalidomide caused the birth of several thousand children with developmental disabilities. But although this case became the reason for the creation of a genetic monitoring system, monitoring of substances similar to thalidomide is not included in the tasks of modern genetic monitoring. This is due to the fact that thalidomide is a teratogen - a substance that disrupts the processes of embryo development, but does not change its hereditary characteristics (Fig. 37.1).


Tasks and methods of genetic monitoring


Fig. 37.1. Consequences of the action of thalidomide, which was used in the late 50s and early 60s of the XX century.


The main task of genetic monitoring is to control genetic defects that arise in the population and prevent their occurrence. Within the framework of this task, genetic monitoring performs the following tasks: determining the direction of hereditary variability in human populations; determining the intensity of the mutation process;


146. Heredity and variability


assessing the stability of hereditary structures of both individual
individuals and populations as a whole;
determining the genetic composition of populations; forecasting the number of people with hereditary diseases; assessing the harmful effects of environmental factors on the population's gene pool. To control hereditary variability in populations, it is necessary to estimate the inbreeding coefficient, the magnitude of the genetic load, the intensity of the mutation process in a certain population, and the change in the manifestations of hereditary traits depending on external conditions. During genetic monitoring, the following methods are often used: accounting for dominant mutations that clearly differ from the norm (determined visually); accounting for chromosomal abnormalities (determined during total control of newborns or conducting selective studies); determining the frequency of mutations in blood serum proteins; determining the frequency of chromosomal disorders in peripheral blood lymphocytes. One of the most effective methods of genetic monitoring is the observation of indicator phenotypes that arise as a result of the action of mutagenic factors and manifest as dominant traits.


The importance of genetic monitoringRegular analysis of genetic monitoring data allows you to effectively control the situation and promptly respond to changes in the frequency of hereditary disorders over time or in a certain territory. Genetic monitoring is used to identify the potential mutagenic effect of new drugs, various household products, food additives and other substances..TOPIC 3


Features of the gene pool of human communities


38


What is a genome? What is a population? What factors are called mutagenic? Why can the frequency of alleles in a population change? Why carry out genetic monitoring of human populations? Gene


poolGenopool is the set of all possible variants of genes of a certain species of organisms in a specific population or in the species as a whole. The gene pool of a population allows it to optimally adapt to the existing conditions of existence. If a gene is represented in a certain population by only one allele, then the population is monomorphic with respect to this gene. And if there is more than one allele of a gene in a population, then it is polymorphic. A gene pool with a high level of polymorphism much better ensures the ability of the population to survive in conditions of environmental changes. This is due to the fact that selection in the population works with a large number of possible combinations of alleles, which increases the chances of quickly forming a combination suitable for survival in changed conditions. And species with a low level of polymorphism are potentially more vulnerable, because it is more difficult for them to adapt to changing conditions. The gene pool of Homo sapiens, for example, was formed under the influence of various factors. The place of formation of this species was Africa, the natural conditions of which significantly affected the gene pool. Several times the species as a whole or its individual populations had to go through a “bottleneck” (a sharp reduction in numbers under the influence of an external factor), which reduced the polymorphism of the gene pool. And interbreeding with other species (such as, for example, Denisovans and Neanderthals), on the contrary, increased the polymorphism of the gene pool.


Factors affecting the gene pool As with all other living organisms, human populations have their own gene pools, which together form the gene pool of our species. The gene pools of human communities can
differ quite significantly from each other. The emergence of such differences is influenced by a
number of factors.


148. Heredity and variability


Factors affecting the gene pool of human populations


Factor Features of the factor's action


Intensity of the formation of new mutations


In certain areas, a stronger effect of mutagenic factors is possible, which increases the number of mutations in the population and contributes to the emergence of new variants. It was the increased level of mutations in the Great Rift Valley in Africa that could have caused the formation of the genus Human 1.5–2 million years ago in this area.


Natural selection pressure The action of biotic or abiotic factors can change the frequencies of certain alleles of both individual genes and entire gene complexes. Thus, it is the influence of the abiotic factor (solar radiation) that is the main cause of darker or lighter skin color in different human populations. Darker color reduces the risk of developing skin cancer under the influence of strong ultraviolet radiation. And light color in conditions of low solar radiation facilitates the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin and reduces the risk of developing rickets.


Interaction with pathogens of diseases


Pathogens of diseases often affect the frequencies of alleles of genes that are responsible for certain biochemical or immunological traits. For example, after the plague epidemic in Europe in the 14th century, the proportion of people with blood groups I (0) and II (A) increased in the European population, who turned out to be somewhat more resistant to this pathogen


. Migrations Migrations from other regions can bring new alleles to the population. An example of this is the entry into the gene pool of Native Americans of one of the mitochondrial DNA variants that arose in Europe. After its emergence in Europe, some people with this DNA variant (haplotype) migrated to the east of Eurasia and entered the population that became ancestral to the inhabitants of America.


Founder effect Since new populations are usually founded by a relatively small group of people, this may be the reason for significant changes in the frequencies of some alleles or their disappearance altogether. Thus, people with the B allele of the AB0 blood group did not enter the group that became ancestral to Native Americans. Therefore, before the arrival of Europeans, the inhabitants of America had only two blood groups - I (0) and II (A).


Gene drift The change in allele frequencies as a result of gene drift occurs under the influence of a random factor that destroys part of the population without taking into account the adaptive value of alleles, which can significantly
change the frequencies of their individual variants. Such a factor was
the eruption of the Toba supervolcano in Indonesia 75 thousand years ago. The eruption resulted in the death of a significant part of people in Asia and Africa, which significantly changed the gene pools of those groups that managed to survive in this situation

Sexual selection Sexual selection can significantly affect a number of genes. First of all, those that are associated with the appearance and characteristics of human behavior. It is the action of sexual selection that explains the active spread of individuals with blond hair in Europe and the significant development of beards on the faces of the Ainu (Japan) (Fig. 38.1)


Features of the formation of gene pools


Fig. 38.1. An example of the action of sexual selection


The action of the complex of factors listed above creates for each human population its own unique history of development, which affects its gene pool. It should be noted that for different populations the importance of different factors was not the same. In addition, its contacts with other populations and the geographical conditions of the place of
residence were of great importance for the gene pool of a particular population.
The borrowing of certain alleles from the Neanderthal genome by representatives of Homo sapiens brought significant benefits to non-African populations of our species. As a detailed analysis showed, populations of Homo sapiens received from Neanderthals, in particular, alleles of three genes of the major histocompatibility complex. It is these allele variants that provide the individual with resistance to a number of viral infections.

Yes, human populations that inhabited East Asia once encountered populations of another species—Denisian humans. Their contacts enriched the gene pool of populations in Asia, Australia, and Oceania with new alleles. It is Denisovan alleles that allow the population that inhabited Tibet (Fig. 38.2) to feel comfortable in the conditions of the highlands. This example is not the only one. Yes, after the ancestors of modern humans left Africa, they interbred with Neanderthals. And a small part of Neanderthal alleles is now
present in the genomes of all non-African populations.
Different geographical conditions affect populations differently. Thus, Australia is a flat continent with no significant barriers to human movement. Therefore, the gene pools of Australian aborigines in different regions do not differ very much (Fig. 38.3). But New Guinea is a mountainous island. Even those groups that live at a short distance from each other may not be in contact with each other due to the presence of impassable places between their places of settlement. Therefore, the gene pool of this population is more diverse and differentiated (Fig. 38.4). A


recently developed method for searching for foreign DNA fragments (this method does not use DNA from fossil remains) confirmed the facts of the interbreeding of the ancestors of modern humans with Neanderthals and Denisovans. It also made it possible to find out that our ancestors interbred with Denisovans at least twice. TOPIC 3

Human genetics and hereditary diseases Human genetics studies the phenomena of heredity and variability in human populations, the features of inheritance of normal and pathological traits, the dependence of the disease on genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The study of hereditary diseases is dealt with by a separate section of human genetics - medical genetics, which is often considered a separate branch of medicine.
An extremely important goal of medical genetics is to study
the mechanisms of the occurrence of hereditary diseases. This is hard work, but in some cases geneticists have already achieved significant success.


Tasks and methods of medical genetics Like any branch of science, medical genetics has its own tasks and research methods that it uses to perform these tasks. The main tasks of medical genetics are: diagnosing hereditary diseases; studying the molecular genetic basis of hereditary diseases; analyzing the distribution of hereditary diseases in different populations; conducting medical genetic counseling; prenatal (prenatal) diagnostics of hereditary diseases; identification of risk factors for the development of diseases with hereditary predisposition. The methods of medical genetics coincide with the methods of human genetics. These are the following methods: genealogical, twin, cytogenetic, population-statistical, as well as the entire complex of molecular genetic methods.


152. Heredity and variability


Main directions of medical genetics In medical genetics, there are three main directions of work that are related to different aspects of work with hereditary diseases: prevention of hereditary diseases; diagnosis of hereditary diseases; treatment of hereditary diseases and their consequences. Prevention of hereditary diseases is the most developed direction. It is divided into social, when work is carried out with the entire population or certain social groups, and individual, based on the analysis of the individual genotype or pedigree with
an assessment of the personal risk of having children with hereditary
diseases. This direction does not require large financial costs, but allows to significantly reduce the risks of hereditary diseases both for an individual family and for the population as a whole. Diagnosis of hereditary diseases can be direct or indirect. Direct diagnosis is based on methods of direct analysis of human DNA, gene products or karyotype. Indirect diagnosis is based on all other methods that do not provide direct information about disorders at the gene or chromosomal levels. Treatment of hereditary diseases has long remained the most difficult direction of medical genetics to implement. For a long time, preference was given to correcting the consequences of gene dysfunction, for example, eliminating a morphological or biochemical defect that caused a hereditary disease. For example, hereditary polydactyly can be corrected surgically, and the development of anomalies in the case of phenylketonuria can be prevented with the help of a certain diet. But recently, gene therapy has been developing at an increasingly rapid pace. Its main task is to replace defective genes with normal ones and completely eliminate the disease in an individual..TOPIC 3


Hereditary diseases and human defects

What are mutagens? How do mutagens work? How does an organism protect itself from the effects of factors that can damage DNA? How many pairs of chromosomes does a human karyotype consist of?


Hereditary and non-hereditary diseases As in other living organisms, genetic disorders in humans can occur at different levels of the organization of hereditary material, which is the cause of hereditary diseases.
Unlike hereditary diseases, congenital defects
do not arise as a result of DNA damage. Congenital defects are structural disorders that occur before the birth of a child and manifest immediately or after a certain time after its birth. Their cause is a violation of the embryogenesis process during the intrauterine development of the embryo. The cause of congenital defects can be the action of biological, chemical or physical factors.


Genome and chromosome abnormalities Such abnormalities in humans are usually very severe and are rarely compatible with life. For example, if a triploid zygote is formed, its development begins, but the embryo usually dies in the early stages. In some cases, such a pregnancy was preserved until birth, but newborns with such abnormalities did not live very long. Changes in the number of chromosomes in individual pairs (trisomies and monosomies) are also known, but in most cases, embryos with such abnormalities also die. There are only a few exceptions. For example, babies with trisomies on the 13th (Patau syndrome), 18th (Edwards syndrome) and 21st (Down syndrome) chromosomes survive to birth. But people with Patau and Edwards syndromes have significant developmental abnormalities of various body systems and live very short lives. People with Down syndrome live longer, but they have health problems. There are more frequent abnormalities in the number of sex chromosomes. This is due to the fact that the Y chromosome contains very few genes, and the remaining X chromosomes are inactivated by the cell, turning into a body


154. Heredity and variability


of Barr. Therefore, the genotypes XYY and XXX do not have any special external manifestations. But with a further increase in the number of sex chromosomes, problems arise. Hereditary diseases are Klinefelter syndrome (genotype XXY) and Shereshevsky-Turner syndrome (there is only one X chromosome in the genome).
An example of a chromosomal disorder in humans is Le
Gen syndrome, which occurs due to the loss of a chromosome fragment. It is also called cat cry syndrome, because the crying of many children with this syndrome resembles a cat cry.


Disorders at the gene level With the help of modern research methods, about 5,000 molecular diseases have already been discovered, which are the result of the manifestation of mutant genes. Examples of human genetic diseases


Diseases Information about the disease


Phenylketonuria Occurs as a result of damage to a gene located on chromosome 12. Causes the inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine. If left untreated, it leads to damage to the nervous system.


Hemophilia Occurs as a result of damage to one of the genes responsible for the blood clotting process. These genes are located on the X chromosome. It leads to a violation of the blood clotting processes.


Sickle cell anemia


Occurs as a result of the replacement of the nucleotide A with T in the gene located on chromosome 11. The consequence of the mutation is the replacement of the amino acid glutamine with valine in the β-chain of hemoglobin molecule. Such a molecule has a different shape and causes a change in the shape of the erythrocyte, which
reduces its surface area and impairs its ability to absorb oxygen

Human diseases with hereditary predisposition, their causes


41


What is a disease? What are the causes of the development of hereditary diseases? What diseases are infectious in nature? What are the hereditary human diseases?


Causes of diseases with hereditary predisposition Human diseases can be divided into three large groups. The first group is diseases whose occurrence is completely dependent on hereditary disorders (Down syndrome, Shereshevsky-Turner syndrome, etc.). The second group is diseases whose occurrence is completely due to environmental factors (burns, fractures, etc.). The third group is formed by diseases whose development is due to the interaction of hereditary factors and environmental factors. Such diseases are called diseases with hereditary predisposition, or multifactorial diseases. According to their genetic component, these diseases are polygenic and arise as a result of the action of many genes. It should be noted that for different diseases of this group, the degree of hereditary predisposition is different. In the development of some of them, heredity and environmental conditions play approximately the same role, while the development of others may be due mainly to hereditary or mainly external factors. The main reason for the occurrence of such diseases is the formation of a relatively vulnerable genotype, due to which, under certain conditions, the probability of developing the disease sharply increases.


Diseases with a hereditary predisposition
There are many diseases with a hereditary predisposition, and their
nature can be different: congenital malformations (hydrocephalus, clubfoot, etc.); mental and nervous diseases (schizophrenia, epilepsy, etc.); diseases of the cardiovascular system; diabetes; gastric and duodenal ulcers; Alzheimer's disease; other somatic diseases.


156. Heredity and variability


Methods of studying diseases with a hereditary predisposition To study diseases with a hereditary predisposition, two methods are most often used - genealogical and twin. The genealogical method is usually used only for a preliminary assessment of inheritance, because sufficiently reliable results can be obtained with its help only for monogenic traits. When using the genealogical method, a large number of families are most often taken for analysis, where people suffering from the corresponding disease have been identified. This is due to the fact that it is quite difficult to find a single pedigree with a large number of generations and also with data on a certain disease. The use of the twin method is much more effective. Comparison of a significant number of pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic twins allows us to fairly accurately determine the magnitude of the hereditary component in the development of a certain disease. To calculate the contribution of heredity to the development of the disease, the formula is used: C = ( M (%) – D (%))/(100 – D (%)), where M (%) is the concordance for monozygotic twins, and D (%) is the concordance for dizygotic twins.

What types of inheritance of traits are there in humans? What is
a hereditary disease? What hereditary diseases occur in humans? How can the contribution of heredity to the development of a certain disease be calculated?


Medical genetic counselingToday, many diseases are known, the mechanisms of occurrence of which are associated with hereditary disorders. The main conclusion from the results of studying such diseases is that hereditary human diseases are much easier to prevent than to cure. Therefore, a system of medical and genetic counseling has been created to prevent them. Medical and genetic counseling is one of the types of medical care for the population that allows you to prevent the birth of children with hereditary pathology. With the help of medical and genetic counseling, you can: diagnose a hereditary disease and determine the type of its inheritance; calculate the risk (or repeated risk in the case of an already detected hereditary disease in an older child) of having a sick child; determine possible ways to prevent a certain disease. Medical and genetic counseling in Ukraine is carried out by medical and genetic offices, medical and genetic centers and relevant specialists of medical institutes, research institutes and institutes for the improvement of doctors.


Diagnosis of hereditary diseases Diagnosis of hereditary diseases is carried out using various methods. Such methods include: visual examination (visual detection of characteristic symptoms);

. Heredity and variability


ultrasound examination (fetal examination using ultrasound); cytogenetic analysis (chromosomal analysis); biochemical analysis (determination of the presence and content of certain compounds that are disease markers); molecular genetic study (detection of anomalies using DNA probes); immunological study (analysis of immunological reactions). Prevention of hereditary diseases Prevention of hereditary diseases is very important, since its costs are incomparably lower than the costs of treating newborns with hereditary defects. In addition, preventing the birth of children with such diseases allows parents and relatives to avoid severe moral distress. Effective measures for the prevention of hereditary diseases are: providing parents with elementary knowledge about the causes of hereditary diseases and the possibility of their prevention; analysis of the parents' pedigree and calculation of the risk of having a child with a hereditary disease; promotion of a healthy lifestyle; abstinence from excessive alcohol consumption, smoking cessation and drug use; compliance with safety rules when working with substances or devices that can potentially have a mutagenic effect..Main provisions of the topic
