Mutations are material for adaptations


A mutation (from the Latin mutatio - change) is a change in an organism's characteristic, which is caused by a change in hereditary structures, a restructuring of the genetic apparatus. They arise suddenly and cause the appearance in the organism of characteristics that differ from the original form.

Patterns of formation and properties of adaptations

Why do dolphins have a streamlined body shape? How do ¬
organisms maintain their homeostasis? What animals migrate and why? Why do bears hibernate and what benefits do they gain from it? Why do different species of birds have different wing shapes?


Forms of adaptationsAccording to the mechanism of adaptation, adaptations can be morphological, physiological-biochemical or ethological (behavioral). Morphological adaptations occur by changing the features of the body structure. For example, the elongation of the giraffe's neck provides access to leaves from the upper tiers of trees. Physiological-biochemical adaptations occur due to changes in the internal processes of the body. For example, in fish that enter rivers from the sea to spawn, physiological mechanisms begin to operate that prevent the excretion of salts from the body and prevent homeostasis from being disturbed. Behavioral adaptations are formed with the participation of the central nervous system. An example of such adaptation is the behavior of elephants in Angola. During the civil war in this country, elephants were often blown up by anti- ¬
personnel mines. But after some time they learned to recognize the replaced places (most likely by smell) and began to bypass them. Most adaptations are a combination of the above forms. They can concern the structure of the body, behavior, appearance, and biochemical composition of cells (Fig. 2.1).


Morphological adaptations: streamlined body shape (ability to fly); long wings (fast flight); wide mouth (catching flying insects).


Physiological and biochemical adaptations: the ability of chicks to fall into anabiosis during a sharp decrease in temperature.


Behavioral adaptations: seasonal flights to wintering grounds (autumn) and nesting grounds (spring).

Adaptations Properties of adaptations The main properties of adaptations can be considered as follows:— adaptation to the action of one and the same factor can be carried out in different ways;— any adaptation is relative. Examples of different ways of adaptation to the action of one factor are the adaptations of different animals to low winter temperatures in Eurasia. Thus, with the onset of cold weather, hares grow warm and thick winter fur (structural adaptation), bears fall into hibernation, significantly slowing down their metabolism (physiological adaptation), and storks fly to southern regions (behavioral adaptation). Adaptations are relative, because the factors to which organisms adapt are not immutable. And certain changes in the habitat can
even cause the extinction of a species, although it previously acquired adaptations
that were necessary for survival in this environment. Thus, the white color of the winter fur of a snow hare significantly increases its chances of survival, because it is less noticeable to predators against the background of snow. But in a climate change situation, when snow falls very late, this adaptation becomes a disadvantage. Because a hare with white fur in a forest with fallen leaves without snow is much better visible. Any adaptations of living organisms are based on the laws of physics and chemistry. Therefore, the analysis of the patterns discovered by scientists in the formation of adaptations allows us to study the mechanisms on which they are based. Examples of such patterns are the rules of Bergmann and Allen.


Bergmann's rule This rule was proposed by the German ecologist K. Bergmann ¬


(1847). It connects the body size of animals with the effect of temperature on them. According to Bergmann's rule, the body size of animals of the same species (or several closely related species of the same genus) is larger in the colder parts of its range and smaller in the warmer parts. Bergmann's rule is well manifested in representatives of the genus Bear (Ursus) (Fig. 2.2, p. 10). For example, the average body weight of a polar bear, which lives in the polar regions, is approximately 300–400 kg. The brown bear lives further south than the polar bear and has an average body weight of 200–250 kg. And the average body weight of an inhabitant of the southernmost regions of Eurasia - the Himalayan bear - is the smallest - 135 kg. Bergmann's rule is based on the difference in heat loss in bodies of different sizes. Given the increase in body size in animals, their volume increases much faster than the surface area. And the heat produced in the body has fewer opportunities to leave the body.

300–400 kg

Fig. 2.2. Manifestation of Bergman's rule on the example of polar, brown and Himalayan bears


In cold climates, such adaptation allows you to effectively save the body's resources. And in hot climates, a smaller body is more advantageous. In this case, the surface/volume ratio changes in favor of the surface. The heat produced as a result of metabolism is more easily removed from the body, which protects it from overheating.


Allen's rule Allen's rule was formulated by the American ecologist J. Allen (1877). This rule connects the size of protruding body parts (for example, ears) of warm-blooded animals with the temperature characteristics of the climate. According to Allen's rule, the smallest size of protruding body parts are in animals that live in the coldest regions, and the largest - in the inhabitants of the warmest regions. Thus, among foxes (Fig. 2.3), the smallest size of the auricles is in the arctic fox, which lives in the polar regions. The fox, a resident of the temperate zone, has slightly larger ears. And the largest ears in this group are in the fennec fox, whose range covers the deserts of North Africa. Allen's rule, like Bergman's rule, also reflects the adaptations of animals to heat exchange with the environment. Protruding body parts can significantly increase the area of its surface without a significant increase in volume.

fox Therefore, large protruding parts of the body are a good adaptation to hot conditions of existence, when the body needs to quickly get rid of excess heat produced. And in cold conditions, it is better to reduce such surfaces as much as possible to ensure the preservation of heat in the body..Topic 5


Preadaptation and postadaptation. Strategies of adaptations

What is microevolution? What is macroevolution? How do fish move? How do amphibians move? Why does a giraffe need a long neck? Why do deciduous trees shed their leaves before the winter season, while conifers growing next to them leave their needles on their branches?


Preadaptations
Adaptations of living organisms do not arise from nothing. Their development is based on the structures and capabilities that these organisms already have. If a complex structure needs to be formed to adapt to certain conditions, it is often much easier to change the function of an already existing structure or organ. Signs of an organism (its structure, biochemical or physiological features, etc.) that can potentially become the basis for adaptations in changed living conditions are called preadaptations. An example of a preadaptation can be the fleshy fins of the ancestors of amphibians, which originated from brush-finned fish. They performed the function of ensuring maneuvering during swimming. But after moving to shallow water, they began to perform an auxiliary function - ensuring crawling on a muddy bottom where swimming was impossible. In the process of adaptation of brush-footed fish to life on land, the fins lost their old main function. And the auxiliary function became a new main one for them. The fins turned into legs, which allowed the animals to adapt to life on land. The number of fins also determined the number of legs in the descendants of these fish. They all became four-legged.


PostadaptationsAdaptations that have arisen in the organism are not complete, they are constantly being improved. Evolutionary changes that improve the already existing adaptations of organisms are called postadaptations. Postadaptations can be formed both within the same species and during the formation of new species through microevolution. In the case of postadaptation, no new adaptations arise. But those adaptations that are already present in this systematic group of organisms are significantly improved.


12. Adaptations


An example of postadaptation is the adaptation of representatives of the Giraffidae family to feeding on tree leaves. For their successful consumption,
an elongated neck was required, which allowed them to get leaves from the upper
part of the crowns. An adaptation to this type of nutrition was the elongation of the neck. However, the degree of elongation depended on the shape and size of the crowns of the trees whose leaves the animals consumed. Therefore, the length of the neck in the okapi, which live in forests, is shorter than that of giraffes, which eat tall trees in the savannahs.


Strategies of adaptation of organismsAdaptations to the conditions of existence can be formed in different ways. A certain way in which an organism adapts to the ¬
environment is called an adaptation strategy. Thus, plants in the forest can adapt to different options for environmental conditions: either they become tall and occupy the upper tiers of the forest, or low and occupy its lower tiers. Therefore, light-loving plants adapt to conditions of good lighting, and shade-tolerant plants to conditions with a low level of lighting. Each of these options requires a whole complex of specific adaptations that are characteristic of plants that have chosen a specific adaptive strategy. Another example of adaptive strategies is the K - and r -strategies of reproduction. Animals that have the r -strategy give birth to many offspring (the moonfish lays up to 300 million eggs). But these offspring are small, and the parents do not care for them or care for them little. Therefore, very few newborns survive to reproductive age. Animals with the K -strategy of reproduction give birth to few offspring (the female elephant gives birth to one baby). But these offspring are more developed or the parents show great care for them. Therefore, a significant part of them survive to reproductive age. Topic 5


4Adaptive radiation


How are new species of living organisms formed? Can several new species arise from one species? What are the methods of speciation? Is it possible for a new ¬
species to emerge at one point without a long process of isolation
and specialization?


The concept of adaptive radiation As you already know, when adapting to different conditions of existence, a population of a certain species or species of one systematic group produces various adaptations. And these adaptations can differ significantly from each other, because the conditions of existence in different places are different. The result of this is that organisms become increasingly dissimilar to each other. This process is called adaptive radiation. The result of adaptive radiation is the formation of new forms of living organisms. Depending on the level at which adaptations occur, new subspecies, species or systematic groups of a higher rank can be formed. Thus, the emergence of various breeds of dogs (Fig. 4.1) can be considered as artificial adaptation by man of different populations of this species to his various needs.


Examples of adaptive radiation of organisms


Fig. 4.1. Different breeds of dogs belong to the same species, but they are adapted to perform different tasks


There are many examples of adaptive radiation of organisms. Virtually any systematic group arises as a result of adaptive radiation. A classic example of this process is the Galapagos finches (or finches). They are often called Darwin's finches, because Charles Darwin studied them.
Galapagos finches are
small birds from the order Passeriformes .

are diurnal and descend from a single ancestral species. Approximately 2–3 million years ago, their ancestor reached the Galapagos Islands and settled them. On each of the islands, the birds had to adapt to slightly different living conditions. They adapted to different types of food and habitats. The result of adaptive radiation of one ancestral species
was the formation of 14 new species, which differ in size, beak shape,
color and song (Fig. 4.2). The result of adaptive radiation was the formation of a variety of coniferous trees (Fig. 4.3). Pines adapted to drier conditions and a large amount of light. Spruces adapted to grow in wetter conditions and dense plantings, where there is little light. Larch adapted to life in the harsh conditions of the circumpolar region.

Adaptive radiation in human evolution Adaptive radiation also played a significant role in human evolution. After the formation of the evolutionary line of great apes, its various representatives adapted to different conditions. Orangutans and gibbons remained to live in trees. At the same time, gibbons developed a very specific way of moving through trees using their forelimbs - brachiation. Chimpanzees began to spend a lot of time not in trees, but on the ground. And gorillas almost completely switched to a terrestrial lifestyle. These two species remained inhabitants of the tropical forest and began to move on the ground, relying on the phalanges of the fingers of ¬the forelimbs.
People switched to walking upright on their hind limbs and moved to the savannas. All this affected the structure of the skeletons of these organisms (Fig. 4.4).

Adaptive radiation also took place at later stages of evolution. Currently, the human evolutionary line has seven genera and about thirty species. Although all other species, except Homo sapiens, are extinct. In the process of evolution, our ancestors spread to different continents and adapted to different conditions (Fig. 4.5). Thus, the descendants of the genus Australopithecus were divided into two groups — the genus Paranthropus (paranthropes) and the genus Homo (humans), which adapted to different types of nutrition. Paranthropes ate almost entirely or mainly plant foods, while humans were omnivores with a significant share of meat in their diet. Different ways of eating affected the structure of
the skulls of these hominids (Fig. 4.6).

Ecologically plastic and non-plastic species

Give examples of animal and plant species ¬
that are widespread: a) within one continent or even several continents; b) in a very limited area. Give examples of omnivorous species and animals that feed on only one type of food.


Adaptive potential Different species of living organisms, due to the peculiarities of their structure, metabolism and adaptation strategy, have different possibilities of adapting to existence in various conditions. Some of them can easily adapt to changing conditions of existence, while others die even with their slight change. The measure of the adaptive capabilities of a species in changing environmental conditions is called the adaptive potential of the species. The higher the adaptive potential of a species, the easier it adapts to changing conditions. In addition to adaptive potential, species of living organisms have another important property - ecological plasticity. Ecological plasticity is the ability of an organism to exist in a certain range of values of an environmental factor. The larger the range of values, the higher the ecological plasticity of the species for a certain factor. According to the level of ecological plasticity, ¬¬


Koalas


are ¬divided into eurybionts (species that are able to exist in a
wide range of conditions) and stenobionts (species that are able to exist only in a narrow range of conditions). Ecologically non-plastic species


of Welwitschia


Fig. 5.1. Representatives of stenobionts


Stenobionts are species with low ecological plasticity (Fig. 5.1). For normal life, such organisms require a narrow range of one or more environmental factors. These factors can be different. For example, in koalas, such a factor is food. This species is adapted to consuming eucalyptus leaves and cannot use other food sources.


18. Adaptations


Plantain


Factors that limit the spread of Welwitschia are temperature and humidity. These plants have adapted to the very dry and hot conditions of the deserts of southwestern Africa and cannot grow in wetter or cooler conditions. A narrow range of living conditions does not
always mean a small range of a species. For example,
parasitic worms, such as the pork tapeworm, can live only in the stable conditions of the mammalian intestinal environment. But together with their hosts, these parasites have spread across all continents.


Wolf


Fig. 5.2. Representatives of eurybionts


Ecologically plastic species Eurybionts are species with high ecological plasticity, they can successfully live in a variety of environmental conditions (Fig. 5.2). Thus, the traveler spread along with European colonists across different continents. And the range of the wolf recently covered all of Eurasia and North America and decreased only under active human pressure. But the most ecologically plastic species can be considered a person. Man has inhabited all continents of our planet. People have learned to survive even in Antarctica. This is due to the fact that people use not only biological but also cultural mechanisms to adapt to various environmental conditions. In addition, people have learned to change the environment to suit their needs and build structures with an artificial environment. Eurybionts usually have a greater adaptive potential than stenobionts. This is not surprising, because if you are adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, it will be much easier to adapt to changes in the environment itself. Topic 5


Habitats and adaptation to them


6


What systematic groups of living organisms do you know? Why can plants not live at great depths, but animals can? In animals that live in water, breathing ¬
is much more often carried out using gills, not lungs. What could this be connected with?


Unity of organisms and habitat Any organism cannot exist by itself, separately from the ¬


environment in which it lives. An organism is a complex open system connected to the environment by a huge number of connections. It receives from it substances for building its body and energy for ensuring life processes. It is influenced by environmental factors ¬.
It itself can influence it, and in some cases even significantly change it. The presence of such mutual connections between the organism and the environment, which determine their unity, is called the rule (or law) of the unity of the organism and the environment. This unity takes place in all the environments of organisms. But each of them has its own characteristics, therefore the relationships of organisms with different environments have features characteristic of them.


Aquatic habitat The aquatic habitat contains the entire hydrosphere of our planet. It is this environment that is considered the birthplace of life on the planet. It is quite stable with respect to temperature fluctuations and has a high density. This allows organisms to grow to large sizes, because, according to Archimedes' law, they are acted upon by a force directed upwards. This significantly reduces the load on the supporting structures of the organism. Organisms in the aquatic environment can actively swim, passively
float in the water column or live on the bottom (Fig. 6.1). The vital ¬
activity of organisms in this environment is significantly influenced by such factors as salinity, the presence of minerals in an accessible form, the possibility of ice cover and water saturation with oxygen.


20. Adaptations


Fig. 6.1. Inhabitants of the aquatic environment Tuna Crab Sargassum


Different organisms adapt differently to environmental conditions. Active swimmers have a streamlined body shape, while sedentary or freely drifting forms have radial body symmetry. Those that live on the bottom have a flattened body and are able to camouflage well. Plants produce interesting adaptations to life in the aquatic environment. For them, sunlight is a very important factor of existence, which provides energy for the process of photosynthesis. As is known, different parts of the solar spectrum fall at different depths in the water column, which caused the appearance of different sets of pigments in the plastids of algae living at different depths. Such an adaptation allows algae to exist at different depths and effectively use light energy.


Terrestrial-aerial habitatThe terrestrial-aerial environment is the most diverse in terms of the set of physical parameters. In its different regions, the temperature regime, humidity level and relief differ significantly. In addition, in many areas there are sharp seasonal fluctuations in conditions (for example, in regions with a sharply continental climate). Organisms in this environment can lead an attached lifestyle
, actively move or fly (Fig. 6.2, p. 22). Their vital
activity is influenced by factors such as illumination, climate, seasonal weather changes, availability of sources of accessible water, etc. Ways of adaptation to the conditions of existence in the terrestrial-air ¬


environment are the most diverse. Flying organisms develop a favorable aerodynamic body shape. Running or jumping forms have well-developed limbs. Those that cannot move actively develop ¬
passive forms of protection, accumulating poisonous substances, etc. Behavioral adaptations are also important, which, for example, become


21. Topic 5


Roe Deer Tit Linden


Fig. 6.2. Inhabitants of the terrestrial-air environment


cause animal migrations and help them avoid unfavorable conditions of existence in a particular area. The adaptation of plants to the terrestrial-air environment is clearly seen ¬


in the example of trees such as oak or linden. These trees have morphological adaptations. The body of these plants is divided into organs - the root and the shoot, which perform different functions. The root provides mineral nutrition, and the shoot - photosynthesis. The body of these trees has many mechanical tissues that allow them to effectively counteract the force of gravity and protect against mechanical damage. In addition, they have physiological and biochemical adaptations. Thus, shedding leaves in autumn ensures the removal of metabolic products and protection from snowdrifts due to the
accumulation of snow in the crowns.


Soil habitat The soil habitat is very specific. It is less variable than the terrestrial-aerial one. But this environment is the densest among all others. Organisms living in it must either dig tunnels, like a mole or a vole, or squeeze between soil particles, like an earthworm (Fig. 6.3). The vital activity of soil inhabitants is influenced by factors such as the composition of the soil, its density, moisture content, the presence of hard layers, the level of groundwater, etc. Organisms adapt to this environment by developing special organs for digging burrows, changing the shape of the body and the formation of special external covers, etc. The role of various sense organs in them changes significantly. Vision loses its importance. But hearing and tactile sensitivity come to the fore


. Organisms well adapted to life in the


soil are fungi and mushroom-like organisms. Their body is represented by a mycelium and is very branched structure, which consists of a large number of thin threads - hyphae. Such a structure provides the best surface/volume ratio and allows these organisms


to


effectively extract the nutrients they need from the soil. Plants have a similar adaptation. Their roots are covered with a large number
of root hairs, which makes it possible to easily extract
the required amount of moisture and minerals from the soil.


Moles and moles live underground and dig long underground passages. Their body shape is similar. However, the method of loosening the soil for digging passages in these animals is different. The mole uses its front paws for this, and the mole uses its incisors.


Mangrove forests are a unique habitat. They are located on the border of land and ocean and are flooded with salt water during high tides. Therefore, the trees in these forests had to develop unique adaptations. Different species use different methods of adaptation, but they are all able to withstand temporary flooding, high salinity of the environment and oxygen deficiency in the soil..Topic 5


Adaptations at the molecular and cellular levels

How is genetic information implemented? What functions do cell organelles perform? What types of photosynthesis are there ¬
? Representatives of which group - prokaryotes or eukaryotes - are characterized by a greater variety of biochemical processes in cells? What could this be related to?


Levels of adaptation of living organismsAdaptations of living organisms to environmental conditions can occur at all levels of the organization of living things. It is quite easy to notice adaptations at the organismal level when the connection between the structure of the organism's body and its environment is immediately visible. Examples of this are the streamlined body shape of actively swimming aquatic, flying terrestrial organisms and the forelimbs of
a mole adapted to digging burrows.
But no less important adaptations occur at the molecular and cellular levels. Although they are not always easy to notice. These can be changes in the course of certain biochemical processes, modifications of cell organelles, synthesis of new compounds, etc.


Adaptations at the molecular levelAt the molecular level, adaptations can occur very quickly. A small change in just one molecule can cause significant changes in the chances of survival of organisms. An example of such an adaptation is a change in the shape of hemoglobin molecules as a result of replacing one pair of nucleotides of the corresponding gene (Fig. 7.1). This mutation causes the replacement of one of the amino acids in the protein molecule with another, which changes its conformation. Hemoglobin molecules with a changed shape carry oxygen worse. But individuals heterozygous for this gene have a much better chance of survival in case of malaria infection. Another typical example of a molecular mechanism of adaptation is a change in the form of excretion of nitrogen metabolism products from the body (Fig. 7.2). In fish, these products are excreted in the form of ammonia, which is very soluble, but is a toxic compound and requires a large amount of water for excretion.

In the process of adapting to life on land, vertebrates had to adapt to life in conditions of moisture deficiency. And the expenditure of such a large amount of water to excrete ammonia was irrational. Mammals adapted to this situation by replacing ammonia with urea, which is much less toxic. It also requires much less water for its excretion, although its solubility is lower than that of ammonia.

Birds have solved this problem even more radically. In them, nitrogen metabolism products are excreted in the form of uric acid, which is not toxic and requires very little water for excretion from the body. Adaptations at the cellular level


Fig. 7.3. Contractile vacuole ¬
of an amoeba - adaptation to life in fresh water


Adaptations at the cellular level are usually associated with the peculiarities of the structure or functioning of individual organelles or other cell structures. For example, during the adaptation of unicellular organisms to life in fresh water, the problem of excessive water entering the cell due to the phenomenon of osmosis arose. This problem is solved by the appearance of a contractile vacuole, through which excess water is constantly removed from the cell (Fig. 7.3). An interesting adaptation option at the cellular level was the development by plants of alternative options for photosynthesis. In most plants, the light and dark phases of photosynthesis occur simultaneously in one chloroplast (the so-called C 3 photosynthesis). In this case, carbon dioxide for the dark phase enters directly through the open stomata. But a lot of water evaporates through the open stomata, which is undesirable for plants from arid conditions of existence. Therefore, they have two options for adaptations to save moisture. In both cases, the light and dark phases of photosynthesis are separated. In the first option, in plants with C 4 photosynthesis (Fig. 7.4), the light and dark phases of photosynthesis are spatially separated and occur in different cells. To provide a small number of cells with carbon dioxide, the plant can open only part of the stomata.

In the second variant in plants with CAM metabolism (Fig. 7.5), the phases of photosynthesis are spaced apart in time. The light phase occurs during the day, and the dark phase at night. The stomata open only at night and evaporate much less moisture. The formation of haustoria in parasitic fungi is also an adaptation at the cellular level. Haustoria are lateral outgrowths of hyphae that penetrate the inside of the host cell (Fig. 7.6). They are the only structure that provides nutrition to the fungus by absorbing the substances it needs from the host cells. Active biochemical processes occur in haustoria. They contain a large number of ribosomes and mitochondria, and usually a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum. Haustoria are formed in such representatives of fungi as powdery mildew fungi, sooty molds, etc. Adaptations in human evolution


Preadaptation to upright walking


The vertical position of the body during
locomotion began to form in human ancestors while they were still living in trees. The first signs of this are noticeable in the earliest representative of this evolutionary line - Sahelanthropus (lived 7 million years ago). He was the first among primates to begin moving the occipital foramen from the back of the skull to the bottom, which is evidence of adaptation to upright movement.


Skull and reconstruction of Sahelanthropus


Analysis of the skeleton of Ardipithecus, who lived 2 million years later, indicates that he was even more adapted to upright walking than Sahelanthropus. Both the spine and pelvis of Ardipithecus already had features that indicated movement in an upright position, but the structure of the limbs clearly indicated that Ardipithecus lived and ate mainly in trees.


Reconstruction of Ardipithecus


Comparison of the skeletons of chimpanzees and ¬
Australopithecus (colors indicate areas that provide movement)


And only the descendants of Ardipithecus - ¬
Australopithecus - had lower limbs
adapted for movement mainly on the ground, and not in trees. The ability to move in an upright position turned out to be an unusually successful adaptation to life in the savannah. This facilitated orientation, allowed carrying young and food, and freed the forelimbs to use sticks and stones as tools to protect against predators. Therefore, in a relatively short time (approximately 300 thousand years), the structure of the lower limbs changed, which allowed Australopithecus to successfully transition to life in the savannah.


28. Mini-guide


The answer to the question of how such a preadaptation was formed was obtained during the observation of orangutans. It turned out that they periodically move vertically. In this case, the legs provide support on the branches, and the monkeys can use their hands to pick fruits or maintain balance. Most likely, this method of moving through trees became the main ¬one for human ancestors,
and after changing the habitat from arboreal to terrestrial, it turned out to be a successful ¬
prerequisite for life in a new ecological niche.

Adaptation at the molecular level


Adaptation to the new habitat during the transition to life in the savannah occurred in human ancestors at different levels of organization, including at the molecular level. For effective survival in new conditions, the role of social relations and mutual support of individuals in groups significantly increased, so there was a need to reduce aggressive behavior. One of the possible ways was a decrease in the level of testosterone in the body. An external sign of such a change was a decrease in the size of the fangs in representatives of the human evolutionary line.


The size of the fangs of chimpanzees and humans


Adaptation to the ecological niche. “Noonday predator”


Hairless body and lush ¬
hair on the head - adaptation to midday activity


One of the interesting hypotheses that explains the appearance of modern humans is the hypothesis that our ancestors occupied the ecological niche of a “noonday predator”. In the conditions of the African savannah, the period of time during the day is a period of reduced activity for most savannah inhabitants due to intense heat and the risk of overheating in the event of active movements. The loss of body hair and the strong development of sweat glands allowed human ancestors to effectively prevent overheating during the hottest period of the day, and the presence of thick hair on the head ¬protected
the brain from overheating. This allowed for a sharp increase in
hunting efficiency, because due to the risk of overheating, their victims could not escape for a long time, and predators could not attack.

Methods of thermoregulation of organisms

Why do most reptile species live in warm ¬
regions? In winter, you can see ducks standing on the ice near the ice holes and feeling quite well, although their paws do not have coverings that retain heat. How do ducks manage not to lose too much heat through their paws?


A variety of methods of thermoregulation Thermoregulation is a set of processes that allow maintaining the body temperature of an organism at a certain level. Thermoregulation is one of the most important mechanisms for adapting organisms to their ¬
environment. There are many methods of thermoregulation that are inherent in different organisms, but all these methods can be divided into three large groups: chemical, physical and behavioral. Chemical methods of thermoregulation are carried out by changing the intensity of oxidative processes in the cells of the body. If the intensity increases (for example, in the case of active muscle work), heat production increases. Physical methods regulate the intensity of heat loss. This can occur due to the formation of special structures that prevent heat from escaping from the body (fur of mammals, feathers of birds) or, on the contrary, contribute to heat loss (large ears of elephants, fennec foxes). Regulation of the volume of blood supplied to the outer covers of the body,
sweating are also examples of physical methods of regulating heat
loss. Behavioral methods of thermoregulation are carried out through certain actions of the individual, which can be both reflex and non-reflex. The search for shade by animals in hot weather or their exit to places warmed by the sun in the cold season are examples of behavioral thermoregulation.


Poikilotherm organisms According to the ability to maintain body temperature at a certain level regardless of environmental conditions, organisms are divided into two large groups - poikilotherms and homeotherms. Previously, the terms "warm-blooded" and "cold-blooded" organisms were often used.

PikeToadViper

But the use of these terms is not always correct, because the body temperature of a “cold-blooded” lizard sitting on a heated stone in the summer may be higher than the body temperature of a “warm-blooded” mouse sitting next to it. Poikilotherm organisms (Fig. 8.1) cannot maintain their body temperature higher than the ambient temperature by more than 1–2 degrees. Accordingly, their body temperature changes with the ambient temperature. This group includes arthropods, most fish and reptiles, amphibians, mollusks, etc. The peculiarities of poikilotherm animals are that the enzymes of their
cells can work in a fairly wide range of temperatures.
And their energy needs are relatively small, so they consume less food than homeothermic animals of the same size.


Improving thermoregulation In some cases, poikilotherm organisms in the process of adapting to their lifestyle can acquire greater opportunities for regulating body temperature. This occurs in the form of the emergence of various postadaptations. For example, tuna lives in cold waters and has a high speed of movement. To ensure such a lifestyle, it needs to maintain a higher temperature of muscles, eyes, internal organs compared to the ambient temperature. This is facilitated by the structure of its circulatory system, which became just such in the process of adapting to the conditions of existence. It has a special network of blood vessels, in which venous blood, warmed in actively working muscles, heats arterial blood, which then enters the muscles and other organs. This allows you to maintain the temperature of the necessary organs several degrees higher than the ambient temperature.

SwallowDolphinBoar


Fig. 8.2. Homoiothermic organisms


Another method of temperature regulation is used by poikilothermal social insects. For example, bees maintain a fairly constant temperature not of individual individuals, but of the entire bee swarm due to the work of the muscles of individual bees. Bees form a cluster,
inside which a fairly high and relatively
constant temperature is maintained. Periodically, bees from the outer parts of the cluster change places with individuals that were inside, which ensures uniform warming of all members of the swarm.


Homoiothermic organisms Homoiothermic organisms (Fig. 8.2) can maintain a constant temperature of the most important parts of the body regardless of environmental conditions. Homoiothermy can be true (as in birds and mammals) or inertial (as in leatherback turtles). Leatherback turtles use the phenomenon of inertial homoiothermy to maintain body temperature (Fig. 8.3). Due to the large size of the turtle, the surface area/volume ratio of its body is such that the heat released during normal biochemical processes is lost by the body very slowly. This maintains a constant body temperature without special energy expenditure for heat production. It is this method of thermoregulation that was used by such large extinct reptiles as dinosaurs (Fig. 8.4). Animals with true homeothermy use all possible methods of thermoregulation. Their

Fig. 8.4. The large body size of dinosaurs is an adaptation to inertial homeothermy,


the advantage of which is greater endurance than in poikilotherms and less dependence on environmental temperature conditions. The disadvantages of homeothermy include high energy expenditure and a significantly greater need for food. In addition, the enzyme systems of homeothermy organisms operate only in a very narrow temperature range. Therefore, even a slight change in body temperature can dramatically impair their performance and increase the risk of death of organisms as a result of overheating or overcooling ¬.


Small mammals have to spend a lot of energy to maintain a constant body temperature ¬
. After all, the ratio of surface area to body volume in them is extremely high. Therefore, a small shrew, which weighs only 2.6–6.1 g, must eat at least every two hours. Topic 5


Life forms of organisms

What is the difference between a rosehip and an apple tree, which are ¬
representatives of the same family? Why do sharks and dolphins look similar to each other, although they are representatives of different systematic groups? Crucian carp and seahorse are representatives of bony fish. ¬
Crucian carp has a streamlined body shape, while seahorses do not. Why?


Life forms of organisms Living organisms adapt to certain conditions of existence regardless of their systematic position. Often, adaptation to the same conditions of existence causes the appearance of similar morphological forms of different organisms. Similar morphological types of organisms that are formed regardless of the systematic affiliation of organisms are called life forms. It should be noted that, depending on the conditions of existence, one species can form several life forms.


Life forms of plants Traditional variants of life forms for plants are trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. But in modern classifications, the number of life forms of plants is greater. There are several variants of classification. One of them was proposed by the ecologist I. G. Serebryakov (1962). He based it on the characteristic of the lifespan of the entire plant and its skeletal axes.

Life forms of animals Classifications of life forms of animals, as well as plants, are extremely diverse
. Very often they are divided into groups according to their habitat
and the nature of movement in it. Such a classification was proposed by O. M. Formozov (1929). According to it, life forms are as follows: terrestrial, aquatic, arboreal, aerial, and subterranean animals. There are transitional forms between these forms. And each form is divided into smaller ones (for example, terrestrial animals can be running, jumping, or crawling, etc.).

Ecological niche as a consequence of adaptations


10


What resources do animals need to ensure their vital activity? Do plants and animals differ ¬
in the resources they need? How are fungi and plants similar in the ¬
features of their vital activity? What features do marsupial and placental mammals differ from each other?


The concept of ecological niche The consequence of the adaptation of any species to its habitat is the formation of its own ecological niche. An ecological niche is a species' place in an ecosystem, determined by its relationships with other living organisms and environmental factors. An ecological niche shows the location of a species in food chains, its relationships with competitors, the limits of environmental factors (for example, temperature, humidity, salinity) in which a species can survive, etc. An ecological niche should not be confused with a species' habitat. The famous American ecologist J. Odum pointed out that a species' habitat is its "address", and an ecological niche is its "profession". Organisms can live in a fairly wide range of environmental parameters. The complete set of all possible variations of environmental conditions in which a species can exist is called a theoretically possible niche. But in reality, a species never occupies the entire niche. The reason for this is interaction with other organisms, which can occur in various forms. The part of the theoretical niche that the species actually occupies is called a realized niche.


Parameters of an ecological nicheEach ecological niche can be characterized by certain parameters. The main parameters are its width and overlap with other niches. The width of a niche is a relative parameter, and it is determined in comparison with other species. A wide niche is possessed by species that are able to live in a large range of values of a certain parameter (eurybiont species), and a narrow niche is possessed by species whose range of existence is narrow (stenobionts). Niche overlap occurs when different species begin to use the same resource. Accordingly, competition arises between them36


.
Adaptations


for this resource. Competition between two species can arise for several resources, but it never covers all the resources of a certain species, because the ecological ¬niche of each species is unique.


The rule of mandatory filling of an ecological nicheThere is a rule of mandatory filling of an ecological niche, which states that there is no niche without a species and no species without a niche. According to this rule, all ecological niches in the ecosystem are occupied, and there are no free niches. In the event of the disappearance of a species from the ecosystem (for example, as a result of its extinction), the ecological niche that belonged to it will be occupied by other species or divided between them. Thus, in Eurasia and Australia, the same niches are occupied by different species (Fig. 10.1). For example, ¬
the


wombat


and the


marmot occupy the niche of relatively large burrowing herbivores, and horses and red kangaroos occupy the niche


of herbivores that run quickly in open spaces. The reason was that


in Eurasia, marsupial mammals became extinct, and placental mammals occupied all ecological niches. And Australia separated from other continents before
placental mammals appeared on it, so the existing niches on it are still occupied by marsupials.


Consequences of overlapping ecological niches Overlapping ecological niches means that species use the same resources (Fig. 10.2). The concept of “resources” includes not only food sources. This can be, for example, a source of water or a convenient place for raising offspring. It is difficult to find species whose ecological niches would not overlap with other species at all. But usually in stable ecosystems the overlap of niches between two species is insignificant. Situations of significant overlap of niches can arise in the event of the emergence of new species as a result of evolutionary processes. If two species originate from a common ancestor, then, of course, their ecological niches will be similar ¬and may overlap significantly. As, for example, happened with two
species of the genus Man - Neanderthals and sapiens (Fig. 10.3). The result was very strong competition between species. There are two possible outcomes: either the species evolve further and expand their niches in different directions until the level of competition for resources decreases, or one of the two species becomes extinct. A situation with significant overlap of niches in many species at once can also arise for geographical reasons. When a land bridge was formed between North and South America, contact occurred between the ecosystems

In human settlements in Europe, two species of cockroaches live - the black and the red ¬
. Their ecological niches overlap quite a lot. Therefore, one of these species began to displace the other. And, oddly enough, the black cockroach lost, although its body size is larger..Topic 5


11Coevolution and coadaptation


Give examples of mutually beneficial coexistence of ¬
different species. In what ways can pollination of flowers be carried out? What organisms, besides insects, can ¬
pollinate flowers? Why can some flowers be pollinated only by certain species?


CoevolutionAny species of living organisms adapts to environmental conditions, including interaction with other species. Those species with which it interacts also adapt to it. As a result, a process of joint evolution of different species occurs, during which species can change significantly. This process is called coevolution. Coevolution occurs in different types of interspecific interactions.
Predators hunt their prey and become fast to catch up with them ¬
. Victims flee from predators and also become faster in order to be able to escape from the predator. Herbivorous organisms eat leaves, and plants in response produce substances that are poisonous to such phytophages. In turn, phytophages develop resistance to the toxic effects of protective substances and even accumulate them for their own protection. Parasites adapt to the immune system ¬
of the host organism, and the latter in response invents new forms of protection. No less interesting is the coevolution of organisms that are not directly connected ¬


by food chains. Significant evolutionary changes can be caused by interspecific competition for certain resources. For example, competition for grass, which is a food resource for artiodactyls and even-toed ungulates. Coevolution is very pronounced in the case of the formation of mutually beneficial relationships between species, when two different species contribute to each other's survival, as, for example, in pollinating insects and the plants they pollinate.


Coadaptation The coevolution of species results in the emergence of complexes of mutual adaptations in them that allow them to interact most effectively. Such complexes of mutual adaptations are called coadaptations. An example of coadaptation is the complex of mutual adaptations in hummingbirds and plants whose flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds (Fig. 11.1). Plants form long tubular corollas in their flowers,


which ¬can only be penetrated by the hummingbird's long beak.
Adaptations


Fig. 11.1. Coadaptation of hummingbirds and flowers ¬
made it possible to effectively pollinate nectaries


. And hummingbirds,
in addition to the shape of their beaks, also developed
the ability to hover in one place in flight to ensure the possibility of collecting nectar. Another example of coadaptation is the emergence of endosymbiosis between a bacterium and a eukaryotic cell, which resulted in the formation of mitochondria. In this case, the metabolism of the bacterium was subordinated to the needs of the entire cell to provide it with energy, and most of its genome was transferred to the cell nucleus. And the cell began to provide the vital activity of mitochondria at the expense of its resources.


The basis of the functioning of stable ecosystems Coevolution with the subsequent formation of coadaptations is the basis of the stable functioning of the ecosystem. Any ecosystem is open, and a lot of dynamic processes take place in it. If these processes are balanced, then the system can remain stable for a long time. And the balance of processes is achieved precisely due to the coadaptation of the components of the ecosystem. If, for example, coadaptation between a predator and a prey is unsuccessful, then an overly successful predator will destroy all representatives of the prey species. But the prey species is connected in the ecosystem not only with the predator. Accordingly, disturbances will also arise in other species. And the predator itself will lose one of the resources that ensure its existence. The consequence may be the disruption of many processes in the ecosystem and even the extinction of species..Topic 5


12Forms of coexistence of species


What are examples of mutually beneficial coexistence of two ¬
species? What are the benefits for plants of pollination of their flowers by insects? What benefits can
hares bring from their interaction with wolves? Can ¬
the relationship between a human and a cat be called mutually beneficial? Why?


Relationships between organisms As you already know, different types of living organisms in the same ecosystem can interact with each other. Such interaction can be beneficial for the species, harmful or have no significance for them. Depending on this, different types of interaction are distinguished. Cooperation is a mutually beneficial coexistence of two species. But it is not necessary for their survival, that is, both species can exist normally without interacting with each other. For example, dolphins and cormorants sometimes hunt a school of fish together, attacking it from the air and from under the water at the same time. In the case of amensalism, one of the species harms the other without benefiting itself. The trees that form the first tier of the forest shade all plants that are lower than them, making the survival of light-loving plants very problematic. Competition is an example of an interaction in which different species use the same resource. Such a resource can be food (for example, grass for horses and cows), a place to live (for example, a place for nests in bird markets, if they are formed by different species of birds), water in desert conditions, shelter from the sun in hot conditions, soil minerals for plants, etc. If the interaction benefits at least one of the species and is a prerequisite for its existence, then this type of interaction is called a symbiosis. Depending on the characteristics of the interaction between organisms, several forms of symbiosis are distinguished: mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, and others.


Mutualism Mutualism is a mutually beneficial form of coexistence of two species in nature (Fig. 12.1). In this form, the separate existence of one of the species is impossible. Mutualism provides significant advantages for both species. Thus, termites

cannot produce enzymes that ¬
would break down cellulose. A they feed on plants. The solution to this problem is provided by mutualistic microorganisms living in their intestines. Termites provide them with food and a place to live, and microorganisms break down cellulose for them.


b

in their intestines (b)


CommensalismCommensalism provides certain advantages to one species and does not affect the life of the other (Fig. 12.2). For example, epiphytic plants of tropical forests use the trunks and branches of large trees to settle on them. They do not harm the trees, but they do not provide them with any advantages. But epiphytes receive significant benefits for themselves. They have better lighting conditions than those plants that grow on the surface of the soil. And it is also more difficult for herbivorous animals to reach them. Topic 5

How do fleas feed? What adaptations do they have for their method of feeding? How does the nutrition of fleas ¬
differ from the nutrition of dragonflies? What is symbiosis? What types of symbiosis do you know?


ParasitismAs you already know, one form of symbiosis is parasitism - a certain type of relationship between organisms, in which one of the organisms (parasite) lives at the expense of the other (host) (Fig. 13.1). The parasite receives a certain benefit from the relationship: nutrients, a place to live and protection from environmental conditions. At the same time, the host receives harm from the parasite, and its vital activity is complicated. An example of parasitism is the interaction between lice and humans. Lice use humans as a source of food (suck their blood) and a place to live (live on their bodies). In addition, on the human body they are protected from predators and have a comfortable temperature for development. But humans suffer from the lice bites themselves, blood loss and infections transmitted by lice. Parasitism is somewhat similar to predation, when the victim is also a source of food for the predator. But the parasite does not kill the victim instantly. Its activity can cause the death of the host, but this will happen quite a long time after the start of the interaction.

Ectoparasitism and endoparasitism There are several forms of parasitism. The main ones are ectoparasitism and endoparasitism. These forms differ in the nature of their interaction with the hosts. Ectoparasites (Fig. 13.2) live on the surface of the host's body or generally come into contact with it only during their feeding period. Representatives of ectoparasites are fleas, lice, bedbugs, medical leeches, females of many species of mosquitoes and other dipterans. The same group includes desmodae, representatives of bats from South America that feed on the blood of birds and mammals. Ectoparasites have many different adaptations that allow them to imperceptibly attach to and feed on their host. Many small ectoparasites are characterized by a flattened body shape and the production of special substances that prevent blood clotting and anesthetize the bite sites. Endoparasites (Fig. 13.3) live inside the host's body. These include helminths (parasitic worms), some insect larvae (for example, gadflies), parasitic fungi and bacteria. These parasites can be located only in certain organs, such as roundworms or tapeworms that live in the intestines, or they can enter any organ,


such as Echinococcus

Fig. 13.4. Representatives of species that use nest parasitism,


such as echinococcus larvae in the human body. Endoparasites usually have dense outer covers that protect them from the effects of the host's immune system.


Other forms of parasitismAnother type of parasitism is nest parasitism, in which an animal uses the nest of animals of another or its own species to raise its offspring, which are fed by those animals that built the nests. If the nests of animals of another species are used, then this is interspecific parasitism, if its own - then intraspecific. The traditional representative of parasites of this type are the Zozulya. Although
not all representatives of the Zozulya are parasites, this method
of reproduction is common for 40 species (Fig. 13.4). In addition to wasps, nest parasitism is characteristic of some weavers, caddisflies, and other birds. It also occurs in insects and fish. In insects, these are bumblebees that parasitize in the nests of other bumblebee species, some species of flies, wasps, and ants. There are also other forms of parasitism. In the case of social parasitism, the parasite does not directly harm individual individuals of the species, but it consumes the resources of the colony, which can be considered a superorganism ¬
. For example, certain species of beetles feed in ant colonies, imitating the members of this colony.


An interesting variant of social parasitism occurs among ants ¬
. Slave-owning ants steal the pupae of workers in ants of other species. After birth, the stolen ants perform ¬
the functions of workers in the nest of slave-owning ants.


46. Adaptations


An interesting case of parasitism is superparasitism, in which the host of the parasite is another parasite that parasitizes on some type of non-parasitic organism. Superparasitism is common among representatives of the order Hymenoptera.


Features of the organism as a habitat The organism, as a habitat for parasites, has its own characteristic features. It provides them with stable living conditions. Temperature, humidity, pH level and other parameters of such an environment change within very narrow limits. This occurs due to the organism maintaining its own homeostasis. While in the host's body, the parasite has no predators, and it is protected from the effects of unfavorable
inorganic environmental factors (wind, precipitation, etc.).
The organism also provides the parasite with a large amount of nutrients without the need to search for and obtain them, which significantly reduces the parasite's costs for carrying out its vital processes. However, living in the host's body also has its own problems. The host's immune system is constantly fighting parasites, and the latter are forced to defend themselves from their effects. Another serious problem for them is getting into the bodies of new hosts. Different types of parasites use different methods for this, which you have already familiarized yourself with earlier. For example, ascarids produce a large number of eggs, which can get into the host's body along with parts of plants on which they settle. And flatworms such as the pork tapeworm use intermediate hosts, with the meat of which they get into the body of the main host. Topic 5

. What animals are ectoparasites? What adaptations ¬

Levels of parasite-host interaction The interaction between the parasite and the host occurs at several levels. At the molecular level, both the parasite and the host secrete substances that facilitate their defense (for the host) or attack (for the parasite). At the cellular level, host species can form special surface structures that prevent the parasite from penetrating the cells (for example, a thick cell wall). And parasites form special receptors
that are able to identify the desired cells in the host's body.
At the level of the organism, animals protect themselves from parasites by the immune system. And plants can create structures from dead cells (such as, say, cork) or a waxy layer on their leaves that prevent the parasite from penetrating the body. In response, parasites form special structures (such as haustoria in fungi) with the help of which they penetrate the host's body.

48. Adaptations


At the level of populations and ecosystems, the interaction of parasites and hosts can occur in the form of alternation of hosts in the parasite’s life cycles (Fig. 14.1). The interaction of parasites and their hosts is one of the most important mechanisms for regulating processes in ecosystems.


Results of parasite-host interaction As you already know, the result of the interaction of a parasite with a host at the organism level is a deterioration in the condition of the host. Usually, the consequence of this is a decrease in its viability. In the host organism, under the influence of the parasite, specific structures can, for example, form, such as the fins of parasitic worms in the tissues of the host or galls on the leaves of trees around the larvae of parasitic insects (Fig. 14.2). These structures can be very important for parasites. Thus, fins are the larval stage of development of cestodes, which, before entering the body of the main ¬
host, can persist in the tissues for a long time. And galls are formed as a result of the growth of plant tissues under the influence of substances secreted by the parasite larva. And such tissues are a very convenient supply of nutrients for the larvae. The interaction between the parasite and the host can end in the death of the host, but in many cases their evolution occurs precisely in the direction of reducing the harm to the parasite and increasing the host's ability to resist. The reason for this is that in such a situation the parasite can live in the organism for a long time without serious consequences for the host. However, there are options when the interaction of the parasite with the host ends in the death of the latter. In such a case, the parasite can also
die


with the host


, as, for example, plague bacteria after the death of
a person who has contracted the plague. Or it may not die if its


life cycle is designed for the death of the host. An example of this is parasitic insects, the larvae of which eat the host, and then turn into adults and look for new victims for their reproduction. At the population and ecosystem levels, the result of the interaction between the parasite and the host is not always negative for the host species. Moreover, such an interaction can be beneficial for the entire ecosystem. If the host species reproduces excessively, then the defeat of its representatives by the parasite can adjust the population size to the optimal level and maintain balance in the ecosystem.


Management of host behavior In modern biology, much attention is paid to the problems of interaction between parasites and their hosts. Numerous studies have made it possible to establish many details of these processes. As it turned out, parasites can quite often influence the behavior of their hosts and even completely control it ¬
in some cases (Fig. 14.3). Such abilities were discovered in the emerald wasp, the larvae of which parasitize cockroaches. An adult insect attacks a cockroach and injects poison into its head, which blocks the work of certain brain structures. After some time, the cockroach loses the ability to independently control its movements, but remains alive. After that, the wasp directs the cockroach to its burrow and lays eggs on it. The eggs then hatch into larvae that feed on the cockroach’s tissues. Another example of the influence on the host’s behavior (although not so
obvious) is the interaction of Toxoplasma, a single-celled eukaryotic parasite
, with mice. The primary host of Toxoplasma is a cat, and the intermediate host is a mouse-like rodent. Toxoplasma cysts enter the rodent’s body. There, the parasite reproduces asexually and produces substances that act on its brain. Under the influence of these substances, the rodents lose their fear of predators.

the chances that the cat will catch and eat such a rodent increase dramatically,
and this, in fact, will allow Toxoplasma to enter the body of the definitive host, where it will reproduce sexually (Fig. 14.4).


Toxoplasma can infect not only mice, but also humans. In the body of a healthy adult, Toxoplasma usually turns into a cyst and does not affect ¬
health. However, if a pregnant woman is infected, this parasite can affect the embryo. In particular, the penetration of Toxoplasma into the brain causes an immune reaction and increased production of dopamine. This results in certain changes in ¬
human behavior..Topic 5


15Adaptive biological rhythms


What seasonal changes exist in the life of living organisms? What changes in the human body occur cyclically ¬
throughout the day? What animals can hibernate and why? Why do many plants in Ukraine shed ¬
their leaves in autumn? Why do animals migrate?


Biological rhythms and their role in the adaptation of organismsThere are an extraordinary number of periodic phenomena in our Universe. The Earth rotates around its axis and around the Sun at certain intervals of time. The Moon revolves around the Earth for a certain period of time. The activity of the Sun changes with a certain periodicity. All these processes affect living organisms. And, accordingly, living organisms adapt to such periodic processes. Their physiological and biochemical processes occur with a certain periodicity, and at all levels of life - from molecular to biospheric. Such cyclical changes in processes in biological systems are called biological rhythms.


Types of biological adaptive rhythms
Biological adaptive rhythms are divided into internal and external.
Internal biorhythms are determined by biochemical and physiological processes in the body. These include the rhythmicity of breathing, the periodicity of heart contractions, digestive processes, etc. External biorhythms are determined by the action of external geophysical factors, such as the change of day and night, the change of seasons, multi-year cycles of solar activity, etc.


Main external biological rhythms

Examples Diurnal Alternating sleep and wakefulness, feeding of young in mammals


Tidal Flooding and drying of coastal biotopes during high and low tides


Seasonal Migration of birds to warm regions and back

Photoperiodism One of the most noticeable factors in daily rhythms is the daily rhythm of light, which is determined by the ratio of the duration of day and night. In accordance with the daily rhythm of light, most living organisms change the intensity of their physiological processes. The set of changes in physiological reactions to changes in light is called photoperiodism ¬
. Photoperiodism is characteristic of both animals and plants (Fig. 15.1). In animals, many processes of vital activity are associated with certain periods of the day and the light regime. These are the processes of hunting, rest, social interactions, etc. Also, the daily rhythm of light can play the role of a
mechanism that initiates the processes of mating
behavior, migrations, molting, etc. In plants, the daily rhythm of light also plays an important role, because only under lighting conditions is the process of photosynthesis possible. Plants are very sensitive to the length of daylight. And this creates certain difficulties if they are artificially grown in latitudes that are not familiar to them. Photoperiodic processes become a signal for plants to form flowers and begin fruiting.. Main provisions of the topic "Adaptations"


Adaptations


Types of adaptations


Adaptation is the process of adaptation of living organisms to the action of ¬
environmental factors by developing certain adaptations


Morphological adaptations occur ¬
by changing the features of the body structure. Physiological and biochemical adaptations occur ¬
due to changes in the internal processes of the organism. Behavioral adaptations are formed with the participation of the central nervous system


Preadaptations


Postadaptations


Evolutionary changes that improve the already
existing adaptations of organisms


Signs of the organism (its structure, biochemical or physiological features, etc.), which ¬
can potentially become the basis for adaptations ¬
in changed conditions of existence


Bergman's rule The body size of animals of the same species (or several close species of the same genus) is larger in the colder parts of the range and smaller in the warmer parts.


Allen's RuleThe smallest sizes of protruding body parts are possessed by animals that live in the coldest regions, and the largest by inhabitants of the warmest regions.


Poikilotherm organismsThe body temperature depends on the temperature of the environment and changes with it. Representatives: pike, toad, viper, grasshopper, crayfish.


Homeothermic organismsCan maintain a constant temperature of the most important parts of the body regardless of environmental conditions. They are divided into animals with true (swallow, dolphin, wild boar) and inertial (leatherette turtle) homeothermy.

Symbiosis


Cooperation


Amensalism


Competition


Mutualism


Commensalism


Parasitism


Endoparasitism


Ectoparasitism


Topic tasksTasks for individual work1. Using the example of a specific species (honey bee, pond lizard, or green toad), explain how poikilotherm animals thermoregulate. 2. Choose one of the groups of living organisms (dolphins, owls, cacti, or moles) and explain how its representatives adapted to their ¬
environment. 3. Explain what will happen if
two species of living organisms (red and black cockroaches or black and gray
rats) with strongly overlapping ecological niches are found in the same area. 4. Substantiate the adaptive significance of photoperiodism for living organisms. Tasks for group work 5. Analyze the ways in which animals move as adaptations to different environments and make a presentation based on your own vision of this problem.

At what age do people get sick more often: in childhood or in old ¬
age? Why? What factors affect human health? What adaptations in a person help him not to get sick in conditions of ¬
low temperatures? What can you name the indicators ¬
of health?


The concept of health
Health is one of the main values of human life and occupies a very high place in the hierarchy of his needs. The presence of health has always been considered an obligatory component of a happy life. In addition, the health of the population is an important condition for the successful social and economic development of society. Health is a complex concept. It is not only the absence of diseases and physical defects of the body, it is also complete mental and social well-being. The health of each person depends on his genetic characteristics, which he inherits from his parents. But the real state of health is formed during the existence of each of us and significantly depends on the lifestyle, habits, behavior and social conditions in which we are. The state in which the body finds itself when its structure, metabolism or its own functioning as a whole or its parts are disturbed is called a disease. The causes of such a process can be different. Sometimes they are associated with hereditary characteristics of the body, but in most cases diseases arise as reactions to a certain lifestyle of a person, his reckless behavior, factors of the external ¬
environment, etc.

Psychology Mental processes in the human nervous system, the effect of external and internal factors on them, the interaction of people with each other


Medicine Causes of human diseases, methods of treating diseases and minimizing their negative consequences, methods of preventing diseases


Healthy lifestyle In order to maintain health, a person must follow certain rules in his everyday life. These rules make it possible to significantly reduce the risk of health deterioration and allow a person to live a long and happy life. A lifestyle based on the rational use of one's life potential and adherence to scientifically sound recommendations from various spheres of life is called a healthy lifestyle (HL). The principles of a healthy lifestyle consist of certain rules regarding nutrition, physical activity, personal hygiene, mental state, life habits and other aspects of a person's life.
