17 Components of a healthy lifestyle


What compounds do people need for proper nutrition ¬
? Why should food contain vitamins? What is hypotension and what are its possible consequences? Why do people often develop goiter and ¬
thyroid dysfunction in some areas?


Components of a healthy lifestyleAs you already know, a healthy lifestyle (HL) is a set of measures that cover various aspects of a person's life. The main components of a healthy lifestyle include rational nutrition, observance of personal hygiene and good mental state, balanced optimal physical activity, combating bad habits, proper organization of work and rest, etc. Often, problems with one component of a healthy lifestyle disrupt the work of the entire system. Thus, failure to comply with the rules of a rational diet can cause a whole complex of problems in a person (Fig. 17.1).


Hygiene Hygiene is a branch of medicine that studies the influence of the peculiarities of human life on his health and develops complexes of rules, the observance of which allows preventing human diseases. These rules are especially relevant today due to the high density of human settlements. Such a situation leads to the spread of pathogenic organisms and has a bad effect on the state of the human immune system.

58. Biological foundations of a healthy lifestyle


Several sections are distinguished in hygiene. Thus, personal hygiene studies the problems of body care (skin, hair, nails, teeth, etc.) and human life processes. The main goal of personal hygiene of a person is to preserve his health and improve the quality of life. Household hygiene considers issues related to the human environment - objects, furniture, housing, settlements, etc. And food hygiene deals with issues of safety and quality of food and ready meals. Compliance with the rules developed by various sections of hygiene reduces the risk of developing diseases and helps improve the quality and duration of a person's life.


Rational nutrition An equally important component of a healthy lifestyle is rational nutrition. As you already know, the human body must receive the substances it needs in certain proportions. And food includes not only proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, but also vitamins and trace elements. They are needed in small quantities, but without them a person cannot be healthy. Rational nutrition is a set of rules that allow a person to receive all the components he needs in the optimal amount during nutrition. In addition, rational nutrition takes into account the energy value of products, because ¬
a certain amount of energy should enter the human body with food.

The basis of rational nutrition is maintaining a balance between the expenditure of substances and energy and their intake into the body as part of food. Such nutrition requires an individual approach taking into account the age, gender and lifestyle of a person. The effectiveness of rational

nutrition are influenced by the genetic characteristics of a person and the microorganisms that live in the human body. Therefore, even in close relatives, the same diet can have different effects (weight loss or weight gain). But some rules of rational nutrition should probably be recommended for most people.


Physical activity Human evolution took place over millions of years. And all this time, the basis of human survival was high physical activity. Therefore, it is not surprising that the human body needs physical activity for its normal functioning, which has a positive effect on the functioning of internal organs. Then blood circulation improves, the immune system is stimulated, and the metabolism process is better. Moderate physical activity also has a positive effect on human life expectancy. For many residents of modern cities, physical inactivity has become a big problem in life. Insufficient physical activity is the cause of many diseases. The cardiovascular and musculoskeletal
systems are especially affected.
But excessive physical activity can also be harmful to health: as a result of too much physical work, problems of the musculoskeletal system appear. Joints and bones suffer, and the risk of muscle damage increases. As with other components of a healthy lifestyle, the most optimal recommendation would be to maintain moderate exercise, adequate to the physical condition of a particular person (Fig. 17.2).


60. Biological foundations of a healthy lifestyle


Work and rest. Psychological aspects of HLS An important component of HLS is the regular alternation of work and rest. Continuous and constant stress not only has a bad effect on a person's physical condition, but also has extremely negative mental consequences. The human brain also needs to rest. When, in addition to mental activity, there are other things in life, this has a positive effect on a person's condition. And the efficiency of work after rest increases significantly.


Rules for alternating work and rest


The alternation of work and rest should be rational. The impact of specific working conditions on the body should be taken into account. Breaks for rest should be regular, not arbitrary. The nature of rest and its duration should ensure maximum
restoration of the body's working capacity.


Another important component of HLS is mental health. The human psyche is a complex system. Therefore, negative influences on it (psychological trauma, negative emotions, etc.) can have serious consequences for a person's life and his interaction with the world. There are many examples
when psychological traumas in childhood caused major
problems in the behavior of an adult. In the psychological state of a person, both his internal harmony and interaction with society, which includes close relatives, colleagues, acquaintances, and complete strangers, are important. Therefore, the issue of a person's psychological comfort is always assessed from the point of view of his social interactions. Topic 6


18 Sexual culture and health safety


Why do the bodies of men and women differ from each other? At what point and how is a person's sex determined? What sexual characteristics are called primary and which are ¬
secondary? What sex hormones does a person have?


Sexual culture and its significance Sexual culture is one of the most important components of a healthy lifestyle. This concerns both the culture of interpersonal relationships between people of different or the same sex in everyday life, and the culture of sexual relations itself. The importance of sexual culture lies in the fact that it determines the reproductive success not only of an individual person, but also of different human populations and the entire species as a whole. Sexual culture is significantly influenced, in particular, by the national traditions of different peoples, the characteristics of certain social groups, etc. The sexual culture of the population significantly influences social processes in societies and the individual life of each person.


Sexually transmitted diseases Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are very dangerous for human health. The human body does not develop immunity to these diseases, so even after recovery, a person can get sick with them again. The pathogens of these diseases enter
the body through the genital tract and, in addition to sexual ones, can also disrupt
the functioning of other organs. The list of known sexually transmitted diseases is not very large, but in fact many infectious agents use this route of spread. There are several reasons. This is both the similarity of symptoms of various diseases from this group, and the frequent absence of external manifestations (for example, in the case of chlamydia), and the predominance of other methods of infection (in the case of tuberculosis). Sexually transmitted diseases are divided into separate groups according to systematic affiliation. The causative agents of the most well-known infections from this group are viruses and bacteria (Fig. 18.1, 18.2).

the causative agent of tuberculosis (Koch's bacillus), which can cause tuberculosis of the genital organs. A significant number of pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases are representatives of eukaryotes. Most of them are fungi and unicellular eukaryotes (Candida, Trichomonas, etc.) (Fig. 18.3). But there are also multicellular parasites (scabies, pubic lice) (Fig. 18.4). These organisms are pathogens of diseases such as candidiasis (thrush), trichomoniasis, scabies, pediculosis, etc.


Health safety in sexual relations Sexually transmitted diseases are not the only threat to human health associated with sexual relations. A significant threat to human health is sexual violence, the consequences of which can be severe physical and psychological injuries. In many cases ,


unwanted pregnancy occurs. Therefore, an integral part of safe sexual behavior is knowledge of contraceptive methods that can prevent this. An equally important


factor


is understanding the dangers of promiscuous sexual contacts. During such contacts, the risk of STD infection and the threat of
sexual violence increases rapidly.
STDs can be transmitted during all types of sexual contact. In addition, they can be infected during tattooing, manicure and pedicure procedures. To prevent the spread of these diseases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has formulated the rules of safe sexual behavior: correct and regular use of condoms; correct use of local bactericidal agents; periodic examination in specialized laboratories; special treatment in case of diagnosis of the disease; mandatory information of sexual partners (in case of infection); vaccination against pathogens for which vaccines have been created (hepatitis B,
papillomavirus); sexual abstinence.


The syphilis epidemic in Europe arose at the beginning of the 16th century. Before the advent of antibiotics, there was no reliable method of treating this disease. Drugs based on Mercury compounds had a certain therapeutic effect. But these drugs themselves were very toxic, and the patient had a high chance of dying from treatment rather than from the disease..Topic 6


The Dangers of Alcohol, Smoking, and Drugs


19


Can alcohol consumption affect the well-being ¬
of a family? What negative social consequences does the use of narcotic substances have? Which organ systems are most affected by the smoking process? Which organ of the human body neutralizes alcohol that enters the body to the greatest extent?


The health effects of smoking
Tobacco smoking becomes a harmful habit due to a person's addiction to nicotine, which is contained in tobacco. Nicotine primarily affects the cells of the nervous system, but the respiratory and digestive organs also suffer. Smoking products enter the body through the respiratory system, so they suffer the most. The smoking products themselves are very diverse, but in all cases their entry into the body causes disruptions in the functioning of many organ systems (Fig. 19.1). Another disadvantage of smoking is that a person can suffer from it even if he himself does not smoke. The so-called passive smokers are those who spend a long time near people who smoke (active

66. Biological foundations of a healthy lifestyle


smokers). In passive smokers, smoking products enter the body with the air they inhale. A big problem with smoking is a person's addiction to it. Its mechanism corresponds to the processes of drug addiction. The main substance that causes addiction to smoking is nicotine. When nicotine enters the body, it stimulates the ¬
production of substances that cause euphoria and improve mood. This condition leads to the formation of first mental, and later physical addiction. At the level of mental addiction, quitting smoking is quite possible. However, in the case of physical addiction, quitting smoking is much more difficult. Because then the lack of the opportunity to smoke causes physical suffering, and the person feels bad.


The effect of alcohol on health You already know that alcohol consumption has a negative effect on the human body (Fig. 19.2). The biggest problems in case of excessive alcohol consumption arise in the work of the nervous, cardiovascular and digestive systems. The excretory system also often suffers. Alcohol disrupts the work of the central nervous system. It can cause hallucinations, inadequate perception of reality, and mental disorders. Under the influence of alcohol, a person often loses control ¬over
his actions. His coordination of movements and reaction to irritation deteriorate.
All this creates a danger for both the person himself and others. Under the influence of alcohol, the liver suffers the most. As a result of the action of alcohol, liver cells begin to die. They are replaced

Its consumption increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Alcoholism disrupts metabolism and the immune system. Formation of alcohol dependence

hepatocytes with connective tissue stroma cells)
as a result of alcoholism


Fig. 19.4. Structural scheme of the alcohol ¬
dehydrogenase molecule


The biggest problem with alcohol consumption is a person's addiction to it. The mechanism of such addiction, as in the case of smoking, is one of the options for the formation of drug addiction. Unfortunately, alcohol is quite accessible. Low-alcohol drinks are easy to buy and consume. And the habit of consuming them can be formed very quickly. In due time (about 10 million years ago), human ancestors developed resistance to the effects of ethyl alcohol in order to be able to eat the fruits of trees, in which fermentation processes have already begun after falling to the ground. This allowed us to significantly expand our food base and contributed to adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. To neutralize alcohol, which is a dangerous poison for most monkeys, humans have a whole complex of enzymes. One of the key enzymes in the complex is alcohol dehydrogenase (Fig. 19.4). This enzyme catalyzes the process of alcohol oxidation and is produced mainly by liver cells. Each of the enzymes in the complex is represented by several variants, which are products of different alleles of the same gene. The variants differ in speed and efficiency of work. A person's reaction to alcohol is derived from which variants of the enzymes are present in their genome.


68.
Biological foundations of a healthy lifestyle


It is genetic differences in the composition of the enzyme system that determine a person's chances of developing alcoholism. In some people, alcohol addiction develops quickly (sometimes very quickly), while others can use alcohol without getting used to it for a longer period of time. But it should be remembered that anyone can get alcoholism. The only question is the time it takes for addiction to develop. Its formation can begin with a very small amount of alcohol in low-alcohol drinks.


The impact of drugs on health Narcotic substances affect brain cells, and their action can easily cause addiction to narcotic substances. The use of narcotic substances creates problems for all organ systems of the human body. The work of the heart, digestive organs, kidneys and liver is disrupted, but the brain is most severely affected. Under the influence of narcotic substances, personality is destroyed. A person often loses his sense of reality, and his behavior becomes unpredictable. After the development of drug addiction, even a short-term delay in taking the next dose causes severe suffering (withdrawal syndrome). The mechanism of addiction to drugs is similar to the mechanisms of addiction in cases of smoking and alcohol use. But with drugs, addiction can form even after a single dose of a drug. Therefore, it is not worth trying. Drug addiction treatment is a complex, expensive and very painful procedure. And if the body is not treated, then, unfortunately, it dies. It should be noted that drugs, alcohol and smoking have another very unpleasant common feature. They can affect the processes of fertilization, growth and development of the fetus, which can be the cause of birth defects. Topic 6


Environmental stress factors
and health


20


What are environmental factors? What groups ¬
are environmental factors divided into? What non-biological factors can ¬
affect human health? What biological factors can negatively affect the human body ¬
? What functions do hormones perform in the human body?


Stress and its causes You already know that stress is a nonspecific neurohumoral response of the human body to the influence of adverse factors that disrupt its homeostasis. Stress is also called the state of the body as a whole and its nervous system in particular during the period of such a neurohumoral response. Factors whose action can cause such a response of the body are called stressful. Stress factors are of different nature. They are part of the environment and are very diverse in their origin. Their sources can be living organisms or phenomena of inanimate nature. Very often, stress factors arise as a result of human activity. Depending on what causes stress, physiological and psycho-emotional stress are distinguished. The causes of physiological stress are external. These are an earthquake, an accident, heavy rain, etc. Psychoemotional stress occurs under the influence of factors that are important for a particular person and may not affect or not significantly affect other people. The cause of such stress may be a bad grade at school, resentment at a friend's action, the loss of a favorite team, etc.


The body's reaction to stress There are three stages of stress: anxiety, resistance, exhaustion. Many organs participate in the body's response to the action of a stress factor (Fig. 20.1). First of all, these are the brain and the endocrine system.
The cardiovascular and respiratory systems are also actively involved.
At the stage of anxiety, the body feels that a situation has arisen that may threaten it with something. At the same time, the body's ability to resist external influences first decreases slightly, and then begins to increase. At the stage of resistance, due to the mobilization of the body's resources under the influence of the nervous and humoral systems, its ability to resist increases.

This stage is the most successful for overcoming the action of a stress factor. If the body fails to solve the problems, the stage of exhaustion comes. The body experiences a lack of resources, and its ability to resist decreases.


Consequences of constant stress Stress is not a disease. This is a normal mechanism for the body to solve problem situations. The complete absence of stress negatively affects the state of the human body. But constant stress can become a problem. After all, to overcome the action of a stress factor, the body uses its reserves. In the case of constant stress, these reserves do not have time to recover. Therefore, prolonged stress significantly depletes the body, which, of course, further worsens the state of health and the body's ability to resist negative environmental influences..Topic 6


Immune system. The work of the immune system


21


How does the human body regulate the processes that ¬
occur in it? What is immune regulation? What is
immunity? What types of immunity are there? Why are people vaccinated ¬
? What is an antigen? What is an antibody? Does immune regulation occur in animals?


Composition of the human immune system The organs of the human immune system are divided into central and peripheral. The central organs are the thymus and bone marrow (Fig. 21.1). All other organs (spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, appendix, Peyer's patches) are peripheral. A feature of the central organs of the immune system is that they are located in those areas of the body that are reliably protected from external influences (the thymus is in the chest cavity, and the bone marrow is inside the bones). This placement is due to a certain necessity, because these organs are the place of differentiation of lymphocytes, and any external influence on this process must be minimized. The peripheral organs of the immune system are located on the paths of possible spread of pathogens that can penetrate the human body. The basis of the organs of the immune system is lymphoid tissue. There is quite a lot of it in the body (approximately 1% of body weight). It includes the retina

marrow


Peyer's patches


Fig. 21.1. Components of the human immune system


72. Biological foundations of a healthy lifestyle


cular fibers, lymphocytes, macrophages. In this tissue, lymphocytes are formed, antigens are concentrated and they come into contact with cells. The thymus is a gland that is very active in young people, and then reduces its activity. It is where T-lymphocytes mature and “train” and then acquire the ability to recognize certain antigens. The largest organ of the immune system is the spleen. It actively produces leukocytes and participates in the neutralization of microorganisms and dangerous substances in the blood that passes through it. Another source of leukocyte formation is the bone marrow. Tonsils are a cluster of lymph nodes in the mucous membrane on the border of the oral cavity and pharynx. They recognize microorganisms that enter the human body through the mouth and nose, and begin to fight them. But the most massive structure of the immune system are the lymph nodes. They are formed at the confluence of several lymphatic vessels and are barriers to the spread of infections in the body.


Features of the immune system The immune system maintains the constancy of the internal environment of the organism
(carries out immune regulation) using two main
mechanisms - cellular and humoral immunity. And they are provided by white blood cells - B and T lymphocytes.


Types of immunity


Cellular Certain cells, such as phagocytes, destroy foreign bodies


Humoral Antibodies - chemical substances carried ¬
by the blood - destroy foreign bodies


Cellular immunity was discovered by I. I. Mechnikov Humoral immunity was discovered by P. Ehrlich


Humoral immunity works due to the activity of B lymphocytes. These cells contain receptors that can recognize antigens. After recognizing an antigen, B lymphocytes multiply and produce antibodies - highly specific proteins that can interact only with certain antigen molecules. Antibodies interact with only one antigen and neutralize its toxic effect or facilitate the absorption of cells with this antigen by phagocytes.


73. Topic 6


Antigen


Antigen-
binding site


Cellular immunity is provided by T-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages. They have receptors on their surface that can recognize a certain antigen. In the event of interaction with this antigen, T-lymphocytes begin to multiply rapidly, forming a large number of cells that destroy microorganisms that carry this antigen.


Immunocorrection and immunotherapy

Antibody (immunoglobulin, IgG)


Fig. 21.2. Interaction of antigen with antibody


The study of the human immune system and the treatment of diseases associated with the immune system is a separate medical discipline - immunology. One of the main
branches of immunology is immunotherapy and
immunocorrection. Immunotherapy is a branch of immunology that deals with the study and application of treatment methods using immunobiological preparations (vaccines, serums, interferons, bacteriophages, etc.). Immunocorrection is a set of methods and methods of treatment and prevention of disorders of the human immune system, which produces the body's immunity (immunity) to a number of diseases (suppresses or stimulates immunity). This term is also used to refer to the branch of immunology that deals with the development of these methods and methods. Immunocorrection and immunotherapy have a single goal - to provide a person with health by destroying pathogenic organisms in his body. But they achieve this in different ways. In the process of immunocorrection, the structures of the immune system are stimulated. They begin to work more actively and destroy pathogens contained in the human body. To activate the immune system, special substances are used - immunomodulators (immunostimulators). These substances can be of natural or artificial origin. During immunotherapy, the object of action is not the immune system, but the pathogens themselves. Vaccines, serums, bacteriophages and other agents used in immunotherapy act exclusively on pathogenic organisms and destroy them.

Fig. 21.3. Agglutination of antigens as a result of interaction with antibodies


Mechanism of antigen-antibody interaction One of the key elements of neutralization
of antigens that have entered the body is the interaction
of these antigens with antibodies. As you already know, antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes. An antibody resembles the letter "Y" in shape. It consists of two heavy and two light polypeptide chains. An active center is formed at the ends of the parallel chains, which binds very specifically to the antigen (Fig. 21.2). Antibody fragments are flexibly linked together, which allows them to easily interact with antigen molecules. The interaction of antigen and antibody can be completed in several ways. Antibodies can cause agglutination (gluing together into clumps) of microorganisms that have certain antigens and contribute to the destruction of antigens or their precipitation (Fig. 21.3).


Cellular immunity was discovered by I. Mechnikov, and humoral immunity by P. Ehrlich. The dispute between these scientists lasted for quite a long time, and each of them presented arguments in favor of his hypothesis. After it was proven that humans ¬
have both mechanisms of immunity, both Mechnikov and Ehrlich received the Nobel Prize in 1908. In humans, five classes of antibodies (immunoglobulins) are distinguished, which are denoted by the letters of ¬
the Latin alphabet: G, M, A, D, E (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE). The most common among them are immunoglobulins of class G (IgG)..Topic 6


Prevention of non-communicable diseases


22


What human diseases are not associated with the activity of ¬
pathogenic organisms? What is the difference between benign and
malignant tumors? What factors cause the development of ¬
cardiovascular diseases? What is a healthy lifestyle? What are the main components of a healthy lifestyle?


Non-communicable human diseases Previously, the main cause of death for people was diseases caused by various infections. But now the situation has changed, and non-communicable diseases have become a much bigger problem for humanity. Non-communicable diseases are called non-communicable diseases, the development of which is not associated with any infectious agent (Fig. 22.1). The causes of the development of these diseases can be different. They are partly hereditary in nature. A significant part occurs under the influence of environmental factors, and some are the result of a violation of a healthy lifestyle and bad habits (smoking, alcoholism, etc.). But most often the development of non-communicable diseases is the result of a complex of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioral factors.


The importance of non-communicable diseasesAccording to WHO (2018), 41 million people die from non-communicable diseases in the world every year, which is more than 70% of all deaths in the world.


Fig. 22.1. Common non-communicable diseases of humans are cardiovascular, ¬
oncological diseases and diabetes


76. Biological foundations of a healthy lifestyle


The most common non-communicable diseases are diseases of the cardiovascular system, cancer, respiratory
diseases (for example, asthma) and diabetes (see pp. 78–83). They account for
81% of all non-communicable diseases. Non-communicable diseases have a significant impact on the country's economy, because their treatment costs a lot of money. In addition, they cause indirect losses, because people suffering from such diseases very often completely or partially lose their ability to work.


Measures for the prevention of non-communicable diseases Measures for the prevention of non-communicable diseases are aimed at reducing risk factors. Such factors include smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, and insufficient physical activity. The best preventive measure for such diseases is a healthy lifestyle. No less important for the prevention of non-communicable diseases is their early diagnosis. In many cases, detecting a disease at an early stage allows it to be cured in time. However, later stages may be difficult to treat or even incurable. For early diagnosis, screening of risk groups is of great importance. Its success also depends on the qualifications of doctors and the availability of appropriate diagnostic equipment and other diagnostic tools. A significant factor contributing to the development of many non-communicable diseases is long-term stress. The nervous and circulatory systems suffer most from this. Therefore, one of the important areas of prophylactic treatment for such diseases is the prevention of long-term stress. Topic 6

Diabetes mellitus


Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that occurs due to the inability of the body's cells to absorb glucose. It can occur due to an insufficient amount of the hormone insulin as a result of the death of the beta cells of the pancreas that produce it (type 1 diabetes mellitus). Glucose cannot also be absorbed if the sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin decreases (type 2 diabetes mellitus).


Causes of diabetes mellitus:


hereditary disorders of the pancreas, in which insulin is produced in insufficient quantities or not produced at all


; damage to pancreatic cells, in which insulin is produced in insufficient quantities


; acquired resistance to insulin, in which the insulin produced is not
perceived by the body


; viral infections - hepatitis, chickenpox, influenza, - one of the consequences of which can be diabetes;


high obesity in some cases also leads to diabetes.

Human infections and invasions In addition to non-infectious diseases, humans also have infectious diseases and parasitic invasions. Infectious diseases are diseases caused by parasitic organisms. This term is more often used in a narrower sense, calling infections diseases caused by viruses or bacteria (Fig. 23.1). Diseases caused by eukaryotic organisms are more often called invasions or parasitic invasions. The causative agents of invasions are unicellular eukaryotes, fungi or multicellular animals (Fig. 23.2).

The importance of infections and invasions Infections and invasions rank second among the causes of death of modern man and can be the cause of 20 to 30% of deaths. Like non-communicable diseases, this group of diseases causes significant damage to the economies of various countries. And these damages are also not limited to the costs of treating those who have fallen ill. The prevention of such diseases requires significant costs (vaccination, disinfection, development of vaccines and drugs, etc.). During treatment, a person cannot work, and after recovery he may need time for rehabilitation or even partially or completely lose his ability to work. And these are also costs. And quite considerable. Another problem is quarantines and restrictions on the movement of people and goods in conditions of epidemics.


Classification of infectious disease pathogens There are several different classifications of infectious disease pathogens. According to the habitat of the pathogen, sapronoses, zoonoses and anthroponoses are distinguished. The pathogens of sapronose infections (tetanus, legionellosis) live in natural inanimate (abiotic) habitats (soil, water body, etc.). The pathogens of zoonotic infections (plague, foot-and-mouth disease) in the natural environment live in the organisms of certain species of animals (rodents, ungulates, ticks, etc.). The pathogens of anthroponotic infections (measles, chickenpox) live only in the human body and die outside it after a certain time.


Pathways of infection with infectious diseases
The paths of infection of humans often significantly depend on the habitat of the pathogen. Thus, zoonotic infections are mostly transmitted through a vector (ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, etc.). Sapronous infections are called infections of unwashed hands, and they enter the body orally (cholera) or through damage to the body's integuments (tetanus).


85. Topic 6


Anthroponotic infections are transmitted by direct contact through the respiratory system (measles) or genitals (gonorrhea). There may be other options. For example, influenza is transmitted through the respiratory system, and its natural focus is bird and pig populations. Invasive pathogens (for example, helminths) can enter the body with food (pork tapeworm) or through vectors, such as mosquitoes (malarial plasmodium).

Fig. 23.3. The simplest measures for the prevention of infections and invasions


Measures for the prevention of infections and invasions Prevention of these diseases can be non-specific or specific. Non-specific prevention involves measures aimed at the general principles of preventing infectious diseases. Such measures can be individual (hardening the body, observing the rules of personal hygiene, avoiding areas of increased risk for diseases, etc.) or collective (construction of sewage, provision of medical care, promotion of medical knowledge, etc.) (Fig. 23.3). Specific prevention is aimed at preventing a specific disease. The components of such prevention are usually preventive vaccination and the use of serums. Vaccination is used to create active artificial immunity, and serums are used to provide passive artificial immunity.. Basic provisions of the topic “Biological foundations


of health and disease Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not only the absence of diseases and physical defects. If this condition is disturbed, a person will get sick. A disease is a process that manifests itself in a violation of the structure, metabolism and functioning of the body or its parts.


Healthy lifestyleThis is a lifestyle based on the reasonable use of one's life potential and adherence to scientifically based recommendations from various spheres of life.


Personal hygiene


Psychological comfort


Social well-being


Components of a healthy lifestyle


Rational nutrition


Appropriate physical activity


Compliance with the work-rest alternation regime


Sexual cultureSexual culture is the culture of both sexual relations themselves and the relationships between people of different or the same sex in everyday life. The sexual culture of the population significantly affects social processes in societies and the individual life of each person.


Rules of safe sexual behavior correct and regular use of condoms
 correct use of local bactericidal agents
 periodic examination in specialized laboratories
 special treatment in case of diagnosis of the disease
 sexual abstinence
 mandatory informing sexual partners if there is a problem
 vaccination against pathogens for which vaccines have been created (hepatitis B,
papillomavirus)

Ecology


24Tasks and methods of ecology


What research methods does biology use? What ¬
laws exist in biology? How can humans influence the state of the environment? How do humans interact with other living organisms? Why is society now actively ¬
discussing the issue of nature protection?


The place of ecology in the system of sciences Ecology is a science that studies the interaction of living organisms with each other and the environment. It closely cooperates with such sciences as biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, geography, etc., and unites various branches and divisions of natural, humanities and technical sciences. That is why it can be attributed to a comprehensive science that
develops on the basis of all three directions and uses their
theoretical and practical achievements. Today, ecology acquires humanitarian and technological features in the process of evolutionary development and becomes an interdisciplinary science. The use of ecological knowledge is becoming an urgent need in the processes of developing new transport technologies, mining technologies, construction and support of large cities (especially megacities). The role of ecological knowledge in the field of food production is growing significantly, because traditional approaches are no longer able to provide humanity with food, and their further spread threatens the existence of most modern ecosystems.


The main tasks of ecology: studying the impact of the habitat on the structural features and vital activity of organisms;


90. Ecology


Fig. 24.1. Ecology widely uses both laboratory and field studies


to study the impact of humans on natural systems; establishing mechanisms for adapting organisms to life in a certain environment; predicting and assessing possible consequences for the natural environment from human activity; restoring disturbed natural systems and preserving reference areas of the biosphere; forming ecological thinking and developing an ecological culture in the population.


Sections of ecology
Like any modern science, ecology is divided into separate subsections
. The main areas of modern ecology are general, special and applied, which have their own separate branches. General ecology studies the general problems of ecosystems of different levels. Its main branches are:— autecology (ecology of individuals);— demecology (ecology of populations);— synecology (ecology of groups);— ecosystemology (ecology of ecosystems);— global ecology and noospherology (ecology of the biosphere and the noosphere ¬


). Special ecology studies the ecology of individual systematic (animals, plants, fungi, etc.) or ecological (parasites, hydrobionts, etc.) groups of organisms or specific types of ecosystems (urban ecology, for example, studies the ecology of cities). Applied ecology studies the effect of individual factors on ecosystems and is aimed at solving practical problems. This direction includes technoecology, agricultural ecology, ecological toxicology, etc.
