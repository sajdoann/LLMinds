The purpose of the first of these is <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-koronaviru/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/\">to compensate</a> employers whose employees were ordered to quarantine or isolate. Antivirus B was to <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-koronaviru/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/\">compensate</a> companies if they had to limit operations due to a significant number of employees in quarantine, or, for example, if demand for their services or products is limited due to the pandemic.</p><p> For injured self-employed persons, but also for partners of small companies and people working on the DPČ and DPP, there is a <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2021/od-22-listopadu-bude-pokracovat-kompenza-43629\">Compensation Bonus</a> program, which <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/informace-o-koronavirus/covid-dotacni-rozcestnik--259263/\">falls</a> under the Ministry of Finance.</p><p> For <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/covid-2021\">example,</a> the Ministry of Industry and Trade was supposed to be responsible for <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-2021\">the COVID 2021</a> subsidy program and the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-nepokryte-naklady\">COVID Uncovered Costs</a> program, <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/nova-podoba-kompenzaci-k-programu-na-nepokryte-naklady-vlada-schvalila-take-program-covid---2021-s-podporou-500-kc-za-den-a-zamestnance---259983/\">intended</a> for companies with a significant drop in sales.

We can mention, for example, the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/zaruka-covid-sport\">COVID Sport</a> guarantee program under the Ministry of Industry and Trade. It also managed the recently completed <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-zaruka-ck-prijem-zadosti-ukoncen\">COVID Travel Agency</a> Guarantee program for travel agencies, which was followed by <a href=\"https://www.nrb.cz/zaruky-cestovnim-kancelarim-bude-nrb-poskytovat-i-v-roce-2022/\">the Travel Agency Guarantee</a> program of the Ministry for Regional Development.</p><p> The above information shows that compensation programs are indeed divided primarily between the three mentioned ministries. We therefore assess Marian Jurečka&#39;s statement as true.</p>\nSECTION C: <p><strong>Context</strong></p><p> Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka is talking about a possible decision by the Constitutional Court (ÚS) regarding the newly adopted reduction in pension valorization in June 2023. The ANO movement is currently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqIebm42vdI\">working</a> (video) on a complaint (or <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p64-1\">a proposal</a> to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl87-1-a\">repeal</a> the law) with which it wants to challenge the amendment to the Pension Valorization Act. The SPD movement also wants <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572040-na-ustavni-soud-se-opozice-obrati-jakmile-zmena-valorizace-duchodu-vyjde-ve-sbirce\">to join</a> the submission.</p><p> Let us mention that due to the newly adopted amendment to the law, which was also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu\">signed by</a> President Petr Pavel, during the extraordinary valorization of pensions in June, pensions <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">will increase</a> on average by only CZK 760 ( <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/\">.doc</a> , p. 1). According to the previously valid <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22604\">rules</a> , the average pension should have increased by <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/starobni-duchod/439182-zvyseni-duchodu-v-cervnu-spocitejte-si-rozdil-valorizace\">CZK 1,770</a> .

The government now expects that pension spending will increase by only CZK 15 billion ( <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/\">.doc</a> , p. 5–6).</p><p> The opposition <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu\">cites</a> several reasons for submitting the proposal to the Constitutional Court. The first is the so-called <a href=\"https://cit.vfu.cz/ppoz/okruhypdf/1pravnipredpisyzakladnipojmyadruhypravnichpredpisu.pdf\">retroactivity</a> (.pdf, pp. 2–3), or retroactive effect. The opposition movement <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">claims</a> that in the case of the amendment, the change in the legal regulation was approved only after the valorization <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-3\">mechanism</a> was launched. &quot; <i>We believe that it was created on January 31,&quot;</i> Alena Schillerová <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">justifies</a> retroactivity as one of the pillars of the prepared proposal, because the amendment only entered into <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">force</a> after the aforementioned date, specifically March 20, 2023.</p><p> The second reason for submitting a motion to repeal the amendment <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">is</a> the state of legislative emergency declared by the government, due to which the submitted government proposal <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=314\">is being discussed</a> in an abbreviated session. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#f1609384\">Act</a> No. 90/1995 Coll., on the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies, such a state can <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#p99-1\">be declared</a> in an extraordinary moment &quot; <i>when the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens or the security of the state are fundamentally threatened or when the state is threatened with significant economic damage</i> &quot;. The opposition wants to refute the government&#39;s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230403130212/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2329976\">argument</a> that the state of legislative emergency was declared precisely because of the risk of &quot;major economic damage&quot;, as it <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">believes</a> that this was unjustified.</p><p> Opposition parties <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">can</a> submit a proposal from March 20, when the amendment <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">was published</a> in <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392\">the Collection of Laws</a> . According to the chairwoman of the ANO parliamentary group, Alena Schillerová, the proposal could <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">reach</a> the Constitutional Court in early May. The movement&#39;s deputy chairman, Radek Vondráček, <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">said</a> on March 19 that this could happen within a month.</p><p> After considering the proposal, the Constitutional Court then <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p70-1\">decides</a> whether the law or its individual provisions are in conflict with the Constitution. If the constitutional order has been violated, the court may annul the law in question (in this case, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392\">the amendment</a> to the Act on Lower Pension Valorization) and order the relevant state body to restore the situation prior to the violation of the Constitution. However, in the past, although the Constitutional Court did not consider a decision to be unconstitutional, it published <i>an obiter dictum</i> , which is <a href=\"https://www.ceska-justice.cz/2020/04/praha-7-ustavni-stiznost-kvuli-koronavirovym-opatrenim-nestahne-jde-nam-judikat-budoucna-tvrdi-starosta-i-pravnici/\">a non-authoritative</a> statement beyond the basic reasoning ( <a href=\"https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 11).</p><p> <strong>Finding to declare a state of emergency</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka mentions the case law when the Constitutional Court found doubts about the method of extending the state of emergency. This <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ustavni-soud-zamitl-zadost-senatoru-unor-nouzovy-stav_2103251028_btk\">happened,</a> for example, in March 2021. At that time, the Constitutional Court was considering a proposal by a group of senators to annul the resolution <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2018-cr/andrej-babis-ii/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-27-6-2018-trva-175411/\">of the government of</a> Andrej Babiš (ANO) due to the declaration of a state of emergency at the request of the governors, which occurred immediately after the proposal to extend the previous state of emergency was not passed<a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koronavirus-v-cesku-nouzovy-stav-senat_2102171308_pj\">by the Chamber of Deputies</a> .</p><p> The Constitutional Court rejected the proposal ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 1) stating that it was not within its competence to decide on such a proposal (.pdf, p. 7. 12). However, as <i>an obiter dictum</i> , it stated ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 7) that &quot; <i>a state of emergency cannot be &#39;newly&#39; declared by the government from the moment the &#39;authorized&#39; state of emergency has ended and the Chamber of Deputies has not agreed to its extension</i> &quot;. As part of <i>the obiter dictum</i> , the Constitutional Court can therefore submit a non-binding statement ( <a href=\"https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 11) or a recommendation for the legislative process.</p><p> Let us add that in the debate with Minister Jurečka, the moderator asked about option B in the event that the Constitutional Court &quot;swept away&quot; the amendment, that is, if it recognized it as unconstitutional, and thus ordered the government to restore the status quo before the violation of the constitutional system. In such a case, the situation described by Marian Jurečka, that the Constitutional Court would <i>not &quot;change the essence&quot;</i> of the amendment, would not occur. Since the decisions of the Constitutional Court are <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/postaveni-a-pravomoci\">binding</a> , <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">the amended</a> law would have to return to its original form.</p><p> <strong>Finding on the amendment to the pandemic law</strong></p><p> In 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf\">.pdf</a> ) in a similar case, where a group of deputies led by Radek Vondráček (ANO) challenged <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=127\">the use of</a> a state of legislative emergency to discuss <a href=\"http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2022-39\">an amendment to</a> the pandemic law (Law No. 39/2022 Coll.) at the beginning of 2022. In September 2022, the Constitutional Court rejected the proposal of the opposition deputies ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 1), but in its ruling it stated (p. 24) that <i>&quot;the process leading to the adoption of Law No. 39/2022 Coll. cannot be considered - at a sub-constitutional level - to be flawless&quot;</i> and noted in passing that <i>&quot;the legislative process under review and its course can be considered a reflection of the current political culture, the state of which is characterized, among other things, by numerous obstructionist negotiations, the chaotic agenda and course of meetings, as well as the inflexibility of the legislative process&quot;.</i></p><p> <strong>Final evaluation</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka truthfully states that in the past, when rejecting proposals to repeal a law, the Constitutional Court used non-binding statements, so-called obiter dictums, in which it found, for example, doubts in the legislative process. For this reason, we assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Marian Jurečka, together with a group of deputies elected for the KDU-ČSL, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=439\">submitted</a> <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?O=8&amp;CT=439&amp;CT1=0\">a proposal</a> (.pdf) for an amendment to the Pension Insurance Act on March 29, 2019. The explanatory report contains a total of 12 proposals, of which 10 proposals concern widow&#39;s pensions, students and mothers&#39; compensation.</p><p> The proposals regarding widows&#39; pensions are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to ease the requirements for the deceased spouse&#39;s insurance period by 5 years for entitlement to an old-age pension as a condition for obtaining entitlement to a widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pension.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the minimum period of receiving widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions from 1 year to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to bring the threshold before retirement age for permanent receipt of widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions closer - from 4 to 8 years before reaching retirement age.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the period after the end of entitlements, after which a widow&#39;s pension can be granted again if the conditions for entitlement arise again, from 2 years to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to increase the percentage assessment for widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions, from the current 50% to 80% of the percentage assessment of the pension to which the spouse was or would have been entitled at the time of death.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed that if the conditions for entitlement to payment of disability and widow&#39;s or widower&#39;s pension are simultaneously met, the percentage assessment of both pensions is paid in full and half of the percentage assessment is paid from the other pensions, unless the amount pursuant to paragraph 1 is higher.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> For students, it is <em>&quot;proposed that university studies be counted as a substitute insurance period even after December 31, 1995.&quot;</em></p><p> The proposals for compensating mothers are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;In order to quickly partially correct the unfairly low pensions of mothers (or fathers in a substitute role) who contributed to the pension system by caring for and raising children, [it is] proposed to increase the percentage assessment of the old-age pension by CZK 500 per month for each child raised.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to reduce the mandatory insurance period to 10 years for obtaining a pension entitlement after reaching retirement age</em> . <em>&quot;</em> According to the explanatory memorandum, this may apply, for example, to mothers of multiple children who lack a replacement insurance period.</li><li> <em>&quot;Furthermore, it is proposed to allow mothers (and in similar cases fathers who took care of the children instead of the mother) to retire earlier before reaching retirement age, by one year for each child raised, and at the same time without any current sanctions.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> According to the former chairman of the KDU-ČSL, Marek Výborný, the cost of adding 500 crowns for each child raised would <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66548830-vyssi-duchody-pro-zeny-ktere-vychovaly-deti-politici-jsou-pro-ale-nachazeji-nejruznejsi-ale\">reach</a> 16 billion crowns per year. The same amount is also stated <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?O=8&amp;CT=439&amp;CT1=0\">in the explanatory report</a> (.pdf, p. 8). Given that Marian Jurečka incorrectly calculated the budgetary impact of increasing the pension assessment by 500 CZK, we assess the statement as false.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>In his statement, Minister Jurečka describes the mechanism of extraordinary pension valorization, which, according to the <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155\">Pension Insurance</a> Act, will be used in the event of rapidly <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3400504-cesko-smeruje-k-mimoradnemu-zvysovani-duchodu-kvuli-inflaci\">increasing</a> inflation.</p><p> The conditions for increasing pensions in an extraordinary period are specifically described <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-3\">in Section 67.</a> According to it, an extraordinary valorization of pensions is applied if the growth of the <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-1\">consumer</a> price index has reached at least 5%. The merit part of the pension (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/429119-zvyseni-duchodu-je-definitivni-spocitejte-si-kolik-dostanete\">the percentage assessment</a> of the pension) is then <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3400504-cesko-smeruje-k-mimoradnemu-zvysovani-duchodu-kvuli-inflaci\">increased</a> by the same percentage as the price increase.</p><p> The period for determining price increases always begins with the calendar month following the end of the period according to which pensions were last valorized. In the case of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-4-a\">a regular valorization date,</a> price increases are monitored until the end of June of the previous year (in the case of a regular date in 2022, this would be the end of June 2021). However, in the case of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-4-b\">an extraordinary valorization</a> , the assessed period is shortened and ends with the month &quot; <i>in which price increases reached at least 5%.</i> Let us specify that these 5% must be the sum of <i>&quot;month-on-month</i> <i>inflation</i> <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/430759-dalsi-zvyseni-duchodu-mimoradna-valorizace-kvuli-inflaci\"><i>increases</i></a> &quot; for the given period.</p><p> Pensions are increased on a regular basis from <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-2\">January 1.</a> The last increase took place <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/finance/vice-penez-do-kapes-duchodcu-i-zamestnancu-letosni-rok-je-fi/r~c15e50f06c8f11ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/\">on January 1,</a> 2022, based on the increase in the consumer price index by the end <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">of June 2021</a> (.pdf). The last month <i>&quot;taken into account for pension valorization&quot;</i> was June, not July, which Marian Jurečka mentions in his statement. However, let us note that the period for determining price increases for further pension increases begins in July 2021.</p><p> The whole issue is also explained in a press release ( <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">.pdf</a> ) of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs from November 18, 2021. According to this report, pensions must be increased by a government decree if the above conditions are met. The government must issue this within <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-16\">50 days</a> of the end of the month in which prices increased by at least 5%. If the estimates come true, according to the ministry, the pension increase should take place in <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">June 2022</a> (.pdf).</p><p> In January, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/media-a-verejnost\">, Eva Davidová</a> , also <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/mimoradna-valorizace-penzi-snizi-tu-radnou-40384069\">commented</a> on the extraordinary valorization of pensions for the daily Právo: &quot; <i>We assume that there will be such a price increase in January that the cumulated inflation from July 2021 will exceed five percent and that the valorization will be carried out in an extraordinary period, which will include the entire price development until January 2022.&quot;</i> She also <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/mimoradna-valorizace-penzi-snizi-tu-radnou-40384069\">added</a> that the regular valorization of pensions in 2023 will be lower than if the extraordinary valorization had not occurred, but overall, both pension increases will reflect the overall price development.</p><p> As for the overall growth of the consumer price <a href=\"https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/cs/shortUrl?su=e730f7c1\">index</a> , from July to November 2021, this value increased by <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/430759-dalsi-zvyseni-duchodu-mimoradna-valorizace-kvuli-inflaci\">3.1%</a> . In December, there was a month-on-month increase of <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/indexy-spotrebitelskych-cen-inflace-prosinec-2021\">0.4%</a> , bringing the total number to 3.5%. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is therefore likely counting on an even faster increase of at least 1.5% in January, to a total of 5%.</p><p> Let us add that the Ministry of Finance, in its January macroeconomic prediction, <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2022/ekonomika-letos-poroste-o-31--prumerna-i-44286\">expects</a> a relatively sharp increase in the average inflation rate to 8.5% in 2022. According to information from the Czech Statistical Office, in 2021 it was <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/indexy-spotrebitelskych-cen-inflace-prosinec-2021\">3.8%</a> .</p><p> Given that Marian Jurečka describes the applicable rules for extraordinary valorization correctly, apart from a minor time inaccuracy, we assess this statement as true.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>At the outset, it should be clarified that Chairman Fiala is talking about <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236\">Act</a> No. 236/1995 Coll. (abbreviated as the salary of constitutional officials). The so-called <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236#p3-3\">automaton</a> , or linking the salary of constitutional officials to the state of the economy, is reflected in the determination of a certain <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236#p8-1\">coefficient</a> by which the so-called salary base is multiplied. This is 2.75 times the &quot; <em>average nominal monthly salary of natural persons in the non-business sphere achieved according to published data from the Czech Statistical Office for the calendar year before last</em> &quot; <em>.</em> In other words, for 2019, the salary base is calculated as 2.75 times the average monthly salary for 2017 and determined by the communication of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.</p><p> The above-described machine itself was already part of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2002-309#cast33\">Act</a> No. 309/2002 Coll., on amendments to laws related to the adoption of the Act on the Service of Civil Servants in Administrative Offices. At that time, the salary base for representatives designated by the Act was to be three times the average monthly wage for the year before last. The purpose of this establishment was actually <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=28676\">to establish</a> a &quot; <em>stable link between the salaries of constitutional officials and the development of wages in the non-business sphere</em> &quot; (.doc, p. 36). The procedural history of this provision then consisted primarily in the several postponements of the effectiveness of this act or the annulment of individual provisions of the Act on the Salary of Constitutional Officials by the Constitutional Court. The final <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359\">amendment</a> to Act No. 359/2014 Coll. from 2014 <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=191422&amp;pdf=1\">comes</a> (.pdf) from the pen of Jan Hamáček, the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. The original government proposal (Bohuslav Sobotka&#39;s government) <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=110647\">envisaged</a> (.pdf) a fixed salary of CZK 52,248 for the next four years, and in the end, Hamáček&#39;s amendment was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=7&amp;t=277\">accepted</a> instead.</p><p> The new salary range was thus determined by determining a new <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359#f5469272\">multiple</a> for deputies (2.75) and a special multiple for judges (3.00). Given the difference between the fixed amount for 2014 and the amount given by the multiple in 2015, Hamáček&#39;s proposal <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359#f5469273\">provided for</a> a gradual annual increase in the multiple over four years. The salary base should thus reach 2.5 times the average wage for the year before last in 2018.</p><p> Petr Fiala and the entire ODS did not vote for either Hamáček&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=60088\">amendment</a> or the final wording <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=60089\">of the law</a> . The majority abstained, and in the second vote two deputies were against. Therefore, the expression &quot; <em>we agreed</em> &quot; used by Chairman Fiala in his statement is somewhat questionable.</p><p> As for the meaning of the statement about &quot; <em>creating a solution that we will not have to return to</em> &quot;, the amendment may directly imply an effort after 2018 (when the salary was calculated by a multiple of 2.5) to immediately jump to calculating with a multiple of 2.75 in the following year. According to <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2643791-pirati-a-spd-pozadali-o-schuzi-snemovny-k-platum-bude-asi-16-listopadu\">data</a> from Czech Television (infobox note), however, such a procedure would cause the salary of a deputy and senator to increase by 14,700 CZK. The government, which proposed <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=167\">an amendment</a> to the Act on the Salaries of Constitutional Officials, is probably aware of this. It <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135103\">should</a> (.pdf, p. 3) permanently reduce the multiple for the calculation back to 2.5 and also change the average that will be multiplied.</p><p> It was also the ODS&#39;s votes that moved the proposal from the first reading to committees, which means that the Chamber of Deputies, including the ODS, will consider this proposal and will return to addressing the salaries of MPs, thanks to the ODS.</p><p> To summarize the assessment, the timing of the adoption of the amendment is appropriate, but the intention not to return to discussing salaries does not follow from the ODS&#39;s vote so far, which concerns the new government draft amendment (the discussion <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/022schuz/22-1.html\">took place</a> on November 15, 2018).</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The statement is assessed as true because both interested parties, according to their public statements, have indeed agreed on the aforementioned steps.</p><p> The result of another meeting, which was attended by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, among others, was a promise that none of the H-System clients would be evicted from Horoměřice until the case was resolved. Representatives of the Svatopluk association agreed with the bankruptcy administrator Josef Monsport that they would not apply <a href=\"http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/klienti-h-systemu-musi-podle-ns-vyklidit-byty-do-mesice-odmitaji-to/1645466\">the Supreme Court&#39;s decision</a> for the time being, according to which H-System clients were to move out of their homes in Horoměřice within thirty days.</p><p> The main success was the agreement to prepare a new expert opinion that will determine the value of the properties. According to the bankruptcy trustee, they are worth about 140 million, according to their residents, ten and a half million. Until the opinion is prepared and evaluated, no one will move. The creditors&#39; committee will decide on August 30 who will prepare the opinion. &quot; <em>Milestone number two will be an agreement on the method of assignment, milestone number three will be an evaluation on both sides,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said the cooperative&#39;s legal representative, Svatopluk</a> Lubomír Kincl. &quot; <em>The opinion should look for what the usual price of the properties is in 2018, but also what it was on several previous dates,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said Josef Monsport.</a></p><p> In 1993, the H-System company concluded contracts with hundreds of interested parties for the construction and transfer of apartments and houses. In the autumn of 1997, it went bankrupt, having completed only 34 family houses. Thousands of people lost about a billion after the collapse of H-System. The Svatopluk housing cooperative was founded by some of the damaged clients in October 1997 with the aim of continuing construction even at the cost of additional investments. The then bankruptcy administrator Karel Kudláček allowed them to do so under certain conditions. However, his successor Monsport later called on them to vacate the properties and enable the sale, with all the clients of the bankrupt company to be satisfied from the proceeds. The members of the cooperative have been in dispute with Monsport since 2000 so that they would not have to move out.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>One of the points of Babiš&#39;s pre-election <a href=\"https://www.anobudelip.cz/smlouva/\">Treaty with the citizens of the Czech Republic</a> was a sharp stance against migration quotas. It is also important to mention that no party in <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/cesko-dal-bojuje-proti-kvotam-na-uprchliky-navzdory-tomu-ze/r~dd56fd0a932411e7a0c50025900fea04/\">Czech politics</a> expressed support for the quotas set by the European Union for accepting migrants.

At the moment, <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/angela-merkelova-uprchlici-kvoty_1806101118_mos\">the tendency is changing</a> and, according to the proposal of the Visegrad countries, so-called flexible solidarity in migration policy could be adopted.
