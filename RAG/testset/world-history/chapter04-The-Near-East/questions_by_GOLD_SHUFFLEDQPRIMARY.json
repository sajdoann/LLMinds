Only one of the following statements is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: If you look, in Slovakia it cost, I mean Mochovce, three, four, which is approximately 1000 MW of power, it cost 6 billion euros. Yes, someone still claims, but you already had a base there in the order of one to two billion, so let&#39;s admit that it was 7 billion. That means, then it&#39;s around the amount of 100, 150, 160, 180 billion. It depends on the exchange rate used to convert it.\nSECTION B: And what is also extremely important, what was said by the European Commission, is that the energy mix is somehow the exclusive competence of individual European Union countries. We will not interfere with how you model it, on the other hand, you must meet certain legislative criteria also vis-à-vis the European Commission in terms of, for example, illegal support and the like. And if you meet all of this, we are ready to notify the process. \nSECTION C: HAVLÍČEK: (...) and then we have NÚKIB, an independent institution. TAKÁČ, moderator: Who stated what he stated that it is a security risk (Huawei, note: Demagog.cz). HAVLÍČEK: Yes, he stated it at the end of last year. At the moment, if I have the correct information, an audit of all devices is actually underway at the state level.\nSECTION D: We have been warning for several months and we also had security information that this (the operator entry auction, note: Demagog.cz) can only benefit one interested party, that there will be no foreign entity and that therefore what was expected from it will not happen, and that this is a really good competitive environment that will lead to a reduction in the prices of data services and the preparation of the environment for 5G.\nSECTION E: So we definitively announced that we are really going nuclear, we described what will be discussed, i.e. the fifth unit in Dukovany, and at the same time the so-called official negotiations have begun, which are not yet the exact itinerary of what, where, who will do exactly, but we had to start documenting why we are actually getting started. And the fundamental argument is clear, and I must say that the European Commission highly appreciated it - we are heading towards emission-free energy, that is, we will exchange coal, which today has a share of more than forty percent, for a higher position, i.e. the emergence of higher nuclear and renewable sources, and these are absolutely fundamental messages that to a certain extent actually correspond today with the priorities of the European Union or the European Commission.\nSECTION F: ALSO, moderator: And the European Union, the European Commission appreciated it? You said. Does that mean some philosophical reservation like: no nuclear, that&#39;s out of the question, that wasn&#39;t made? HAVLÍČEK: In no case was it made at all. On the contrary, what was said was that it is right that we are heading towards a zero-emission economy, or rather energy, ad 1 and ad 2, it was clearly said that nuclear is a zero-emission source. The fact that someone has a tendency from time to time, especially from among the critics, to question that, that was said literally and literally by the Director General, (...) that&#39;s what the Director General of the Directorate General Energo, the European Commission, said directly.\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

The merit part of the pension (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/429119-zvyseni-duchodu-je-definitivni-spocitejte-si-kolik-dostanete\">the percentage assessment</a> of the pension) is then <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3400504-cesko-smeruje-k-mimoradnemu-zvysovani-duchodu-kvuli-inflaci\">increased</a> by the same percentage as the price increase.</p><p> The period for determining price increases always begins with the calendar month following the end of the period according to which pensions were last valorized. In the case of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-4-a\">a regular valorization date,</a> price increases are monitored until the end of June of the previous year (in the case of a regular date in 2022, this would be the end of June 2021).

The last month <i>&quot;taken into account for pension valorization&quot;</i> was June, not July, which Marian Jurečka mentions in his statement. However, let us note that the period for determining price increases for further pension increases begins in July 2021.</p><p> The whole issue is also explained in a press release ( <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">.pdf</a> ) of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs from November 18, 2021. According to this report, pensions must be increased by a government decree if the above conditions are met. The government must issue this within <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-16\">50 days</a> of the end of the month in which prices increased by at least 5%. If the estimates come true, according to the ministry, the pension increase should take place in <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/2061970/18_11_2021_TZ_mimoradna_valorizace_pri_rychlem_rustu_cen.pdf/\">June 2022</a> (.pdf).</p><p> In January, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/media-a-verejnost\">, Eva Davidová</a> , also <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/mimoradna-valorizace-penzi-snizi-tu-radnou-40384069\">commented</a> on the extraordinary valorization of pensions for the daily Právo: &quot; <i>We assume that there will be such a price increase in January that the cumulated inflation from July 2021 will exceed five percent and that the valorization will be carried out in an extraordinary period, which will include the entire price development until January 2022.&quot;</i> She also <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/mimoradna-valorizace-penzi-snizi-tu-radnou-40384069\">added</a> that the regular valorization of pensions in 2023 will be lower than if the extraordinary valorization had not occurred, but overall, both pension increases will reflect the overall price development.</p><p> As for the overall growth of the consumer price <a href=\"https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/cs/shortUrl?su=e730f7c1\">index</a> , from July to November 2021, this value increased by <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/duchody/430759-dalsi-zvyseni-duchodu-mimoradna-valorizace-kvuli-inflaci\">3.1%</a> . In December, there was a month-on-month increase of <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/indexy-spotrebitelskych-cen-inflace-prosinec-2021\">0.4%</a> , bringing the total number to 3.5%. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is therefore likely counting on an even faster increase of at least 1.5% in January, to a total of 5%.</p><p> Let us add that the Ministry of Finance, in its January macroeconomic prediction, <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2022/ekonomika-letos-poroste-o-31--prumerna-i-44286\">expects</a> a relatively sharp increase in the average inflation rate to 8.5% in 2022.

The explanatory report contains a total of 12 proposals, of which 10 proposals concern widow&#39;s pensions, students and mothers&#39; compensation.</p><p> The proposals regarding widows&#39; pensions are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to ease the requirements for the deceased spouse&#39;s insurance period by 5 years for entitlement to an old-age pension as a condition for obtaining entitlement to a widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pension.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the minimum period of receiving widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions from 1 year to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to bring the threshold before retirement age for permanent receipt of widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions closer - from 4 to 8 years before reaching retirement age.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to extend the period after the end of entitlements, after which a widow&#39;s pension can be granted again if the conditions for entitlement arise again, from 2 years to 5 years.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to increase the percentage assessment for widow&#39;s and widower&#39;s pensions, from the current 50% to 80% of the percentage assessment of the pension to which the spouse was or would have been entitled at the time of death.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed that if the conditions for entitlement to payment of disability and widow&#39;s or widower&#39;s pension are simultaneously met, the percentage assessment of both pensions is paid in full and half of the percentage assessment is paid from the other pensions, unless the amount pursuant to paragraph 1 is higher.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> For students, it is <em>&quot;proposed that university studies be counted as a substitute insurance period even after December 31, 1995.&quot;</em></p><p> The proposals for compensating mothers are as follows:</p><ul><li> <em>&quot;In order to quickly partially correct the unfairly low pensions of mothers (or fathers in a substitute role) who contributed to the pension system by caring for and raising children, [it is] proposed to increase the percentage assessment of the old-age pension by CZK 500 per month for each child raised.&quot;</em></li><li> <em>&quot;It is proposed to reduce the mandatory insurance period to 10 years for obtaining a pension entitlement after reaching retirement age</em> . <em>&quot;</em> According to the explanatory memorandum, this may apply, for example, to mothers of multiple children who lack a replacement insurance period.</li><li> <em>&quot;Furthermore, it is proposed to allow mothers (and in similar cases fathers who took care of the children instead of the mother) to retire earlier before reaching retirement age, by one year for each child raised, and at the same time without any current sanctions.&quot;</em></li></ul><p> According to the former chairman of the KDU-ČSL, Marek Výborný, the cost of adding 500 crowns for each child raised would <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66548830-vyssi-duchody-pro-zeny-ktere-vychovaly-deti-politici-jsou-pro-ale-nachazeji-nejruznejsi-ale\">reach</a> 16 billion crowns per year. The same amount is also stated <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/tiskt.sqw?O=8&amp;CT=439&amp;CT1=0\">in the explanatory report</a> (.pdf, p. 8). Given that Marian Jurečka incorrectly calculated the budgetary impact of increasing the pension assessment by 500 CZK, we assess the statement as false.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>The former government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-schvalila-podpurne-programy-pro-podnikatele-postizene-protiepidemickymi-opatrenimi-192462/\">introduced</a> several programs to help employees, businesses, and the self-employed (SVČ) during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p> As for the current <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace\">compensation</a> programs, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/informace-o-koronavirus/covid-dotacni-rozcestnik--259263/\">includes</a> , for example, <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/antivirus-nucene-omezeni-provozu-karanteny\">the Antivirus A</a> and <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/antivirus-b\">Antivirus B</a> programs. The purpose of the first of these is <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-koronaviru/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/\">to compensate</a> employers whose employees were ordered to quarantine or isolate. Antivirus B was to <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/epidemie-koronaviru/dulezite-informace/podpora-a-ulevy-pro-podnikatele-a-zamestnance-180601/\">compensate</a> companies if they had to limit operations due to a significant number of employees in quarantine, or, for example, if demand for their services or products is limited due to the pandemic.</p><p> For injured self-employed persons, but also for partners of small companies and people working on the DPČ and DPP, there is a <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy/2021/od-22-listopadu-bude-pokracovat-kompenza-43629\">Compensation Bonus</a> program, which <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/informace-o-koronavirus/covid-dotacni-rozcestnik--259263/\">falls</a> under the Ministry of Finance.</p><p> For <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/covid-2021\">example,</a> the Ministry of Industry and Trade was supposed to be responsible for <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-2021\">the COVID 2021</a> subsidy program and the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-nepokryte-naklady\">COVID Uncovered Costs</a> program, <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/nova-podoba-kompenzaci-k-programu-na-nepokryte-naklady-vlada-schvalila-take-program-covid---2021-s-podporou-500-kc-za-den-a-zamestnance---259983/\">intended</a> for companies with a significant drop in sales. Although they were already prepared, the government ultimately decided <a href=\"https://www.podnikatel.cz/aktuality/firmy-maji-smulu-novy-ministr-odmitl-programy-covid-2021-a-nepokryte-naklady/\">not to</a> relaunch them.</p><p> Let us add that there are currently some programs whose purpose is primarily to provide entrepreneurs with loan <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace\">guarantees</a> , but these are not classic compensations. We can mention, for example, the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/zaruka-covid-sport\">COVID Sport</a> guarantee program under the Ministry of Industry and Trade. It also managed the recently completed <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/covid-zaruka-ck-prijem-zadosti-ukoncen\">COVID Travel Agency</a> Guarantee program for travel agencies, which was followed by <a href=\"https://www.nrb.cz/zaruky-cestovnim-kancelarim-bude-nrb-poskytovat-i-v-roce-2022/\">the Travel Agency Guarantee</a> program of the Ministry for Regional Development.</p><p> The above information shows that compensation programs are indeed divided primarily between the three mentioned ministries.
