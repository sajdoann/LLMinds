    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>In the parliamentary elections in 2013, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">384,174</a> votes, and in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">572,948</a> , or 49% more. This number fits within our tolerance of 10% deviation. In percentage terms, it was 7.72% and 11.32% of the votes, respectively. At the same time, the party received 56.25% more seats ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">25</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1\">16</a> ). </p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-69s2T\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/69s2T/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"273\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20161007&amp;xv=2\">2016</a> Senate elections, the party won only two mandates, compared to 9 in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005\">2018.</a> In the 2018 elections, it also <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/volby/senat?k=2&amp;t=uspesnost-stran\">defended</a> only 4 mandates. So, ODS is also succeeding in fulfilling this goal in the Senate elections. Moreover, ODS won in the last Senate elections, as Petr Fiala further claims. In <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1213?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xdatum=20181005&amp;xv=2\">2018</a> , ODS candidates won a total of 9 mandates in 27 constituencies. Candidates for the second most successful party, STAN, won only 3 mandates.</p><p> In the European Parliament elections, the party has also managed to meet the 50% growth target, and even significantly exceeded it. In 2014, ODS received <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> votes, and in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , an increase of 196%. At the same time, the party received almost double the percentage of votes in 2018 ( <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">14.54%</a> compared to <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">7.67%</a> in 2014). The number of seats won by ODS doubled from two in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> to four in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">the last</a> elections. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in the European Parliament elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ebPAZ\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ebPAZ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"290\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p> In the context of the European elections, the part about second place, doubling the number of mandates and tripling the number of votes is also true. In the last EP elections, ODS indeed finished <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep?xjazyk=CZ\">second</a> behind the ANO movement. In the <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">2014</a> elections, the party won 2 mandates, while in <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep144?xjazyk=CZ\">this year&#39;s</a> elections it won 4. The number of votes from 2014 is <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2014/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">116,389</a> , and from 2019 it was <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2019/ep11?xjazyk=CZ\">344,885</a> , which is approximately 2.96 times more.</p><p> In the elections to city and municipal councils, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9,178,453 votes in 2014. In 2018, it <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 14,905,827 votes. The result thus exceeds the target set by Fiala by 1,138,147 votes. In percentage terms, the party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 9.26% of the votes in 2014, and 13.56% in <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">the following</a> elections. It therefore received 0.33% less than the commitment assumes. However, the result fits within our 10% tolerance. The party <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2014/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">received</a> 2,398 mandates in 2014, which is 3.86%. In <a href=\"https://volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=2&amp;xdz=7&amp;xnumnuts=0&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=1\">2018</a> , it received 2,600, or 4.2%. It is therefore clear that the party did not meet this Fiala target in terms of the number of mandates in the municipal elections. However, even in these elections, the commitment was fulfilled in two of the three possible calculation methods (absolute number of votes and percentage of votes), therefore we evaluate the statement as a whole as true. </p><p></p><div><iframe title=\"ODS&#39;s gain in municipal elections\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-jUB4F\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jUB4F/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"277\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></div><p></p>\nSECTION B: <p>The European refugee crisis, as the wave of migration to Europe in 2015 and 2016 was called, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/czech-republic/news/migrace/migrace_historicky_prehled_cs\">began</a> in the spring of 2015 and was caused by the escalation of the <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3283818-krvavy-konflikt-v-syrii-vypukl-pred-deseti-lety-u-moci-zustava-oslabeny-basar-asad\">war</a> in Syria. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/48Cio/1/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-48Cio\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" title=\"Number of asylum applications to EU countries\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></figure><p> A dispute arose in the European Union over the redistribution of refugees heading to Europe who had already arrived in Greece and Italy.

However, the loudest opposition <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">came</a> from <a href=\"https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/mezinarodni-organizace-a-vs-visegradska-ctyrka.aspx\">the Visegrad Four</a> . The quotas <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">were</a> approved by EU interior ministers in September 2015. In December of the same year, Slovakia and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">filed</a> a lawsuit with the Court of Justice of the EU against the redistribution of asylum seekers based on quotas. In June 2017, for example, the Czech government <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vlada-cesko-uz-neprijme-zadneho-migranta-na-zaklade-kvot-zhorsila-se_1706051706_pj\">decided</a> that it would no longer accept any asylum seekers based on quotas, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">accepting</a> 12 of the 2,600 people allocated.</p><p> The European Commission then decided to open infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In September 2017, the relocation programme for applicants from Greece and Italy <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">ended</a> , with 29,144 people out of 160,000 being relocated and only five countries fulfilling their quotas. In April 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3070650-soud-eu-odmitanim-uprchlickych-kvot-porusily-zeme-sve-povinnosti\">had failed to fulfil</a> their obligations under European Union law.</p><p> On the contrary, in 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/svet/3173733-od-vety-zvladneme-uplynulo-pet-let-rozhodla-bych-se-stejne-tvrdi-merkelova\">took a</a> welcoming stance towards accepting refugees with her famous media statement &quot;we will <i>manage it</i> &quot;. At that time, Germany <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/migr_asyappctza/default/table?lang=en\">was</a> also the country with the highest number of asylum applications. However, Armin Laschet, the CDU candidate for chancellor in the September German elections, has now expressed the opposite. After the capture of Kabul, <a href=\"https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fluechtlinge-afghanistan-121.html\">he stated</a> that Germany &quot; <i>must not give the impression that we can accept every person in need</i> &quot;.</p><p> French President Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/evropsky-parlament/v-evrope-rostou-nove-ploty-unie-se-boji-uprchlicke-vlny-z-af/r~a5d8490204d511ec966d0cc47ab5f122/\">spoke</a> about the need to &quot; <i>defend against illegal migration</i> &quot; after the fall of Kabul. His predecessor, François Hollande, chose a different rhetoric in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-france/hollande-opens-french-doors-to-refugees-despite-opposition-idUKKCN0R70WC20150907\">saying he</a> would &quot; <i>get the crisis under control</i> &quot; and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/french-president-francois-hollande-welcomes-refugees-paris-attack/story?id=35274658\">defending</a> his decision to uphold his refugee admission commitments despite the terrorist attacks in Paris.</p><p> Six EU member states, including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/six-countries-urge-eu-not-stop-deportations-afghanistan-belgium-says-2021-08-10/\">sent</a> a letter to the European Commission in early August 2021 warning against halting deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers, despite the Taliban&#39;s advance in their homeland. However, Germany, along with another signatory of the letter, the Netherlands, subsequently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">announced</a> that they would not deport the unaccepted Afghans for the time being due to the development of the conflict. However, Austria <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-odds-migrant-returns-afghan-conflict-grows-2021-08-11/\">did not change</a> its position and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-austria-pm-wont-take-in-any-more-afghanistan-refugees-taliban/\">ruled out</a> accepting people fleeing Afghanistan, saying that this would not happen during his term in office.

Petr Fiala stated (time 49:22) that <i>&quot;good government governs for everyone, even for those who did not vote for it&quot;</i> . He then illustrates this position by referring to his older statement from the election staff, which is the content of the verified statement.</p><p> Petr Fiala, in the SPOLU coalition&#39;s election staff, gave his first post-election speech on October 9, when <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3383514-zmeny-je-tady-my-jsme-ji-slibili-my-ji-udelame-rekl-lidr-spolu-fiala\">he said</a> (video, time 1:52): <i>&quot;(…) I would like to ask you something in this context. All of you who are watching us. It doesn&#39;t matter who you voted for, it doesn&#39;t matter what your political preferences are. First and foremost, we are all citizens of the Czech Republic who want to live here and we want to live here together, as neighbors, as friends, as colleagues. That is what unites us all.&quot;</i></p><p> Let us add that the SPOLU coalition <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps124?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xkraj=0&amp;xstrana=13&amp;xv=1\">, consisting of</a> ODS, TOP 09 and KDU-ČSL, won <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2021/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">27.79%</a> of the votes in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, finishing first.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>First of all, let us state that the part of the statement where Petr Fiala states that it was not easy for ODS not to field its candidate in every district is an opinion statement, and therefore we will not evaluate it as such.</p><p> ODS can be considered a traditional political party on the Czech scene (it was <a href=\"https://aplikace.mvcr.cz/seznam-politickych-stran/Vypis_Rejstrik.aspx?id=120\">founded</a> in 1991). The part of the statement regarding the 2018 Senate elections can also be considered completely true.

On December 14, 2021, the Chamber of Deputies <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2021ps/stenprot/004schuz/bqbs/b02100901.htm\">voted</a> on <i>the Resolution of the Parliament on the necessary role of nuclear energy in the decarbonization of the economy</i> .

It cannot be seen as just a &quot;transitional&quot; category, but as a tool that &quot;enables&quot; the low-carbon transformation of the economy and makes it economically and socially sustainable in the long term. The criteria for the sustainability of the low-carbon transformation of the economy should be technologically neutral and must not differentiate between generations of nuclear installations or reactor technology,</li><li> also notes that the Czech Republic intends to temporarily use natural gas in its mix,</li><li> Calls on the EU to include gas as a transitional source and nuclear energy as a sustainable source,</li><li> instructs Andrej Babiš, the outgoing Prime Minister, to present this opinion to the European Council at its meeting on 15 December 2021.</li></ul><p> The majority of deputies, with the exception of SPD representatives, voted <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=77438&amp;l=cz\">in favor of</a> this proposal.

The only exception was to be teachers&#39; salaries. Alena Schillerová stated at the time that the government could not afford to increase the salaries of civil servants due to the high state budget deficit.</p><p> The then Minister of the Interior, Hamáček, <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/hamacek-rakusan-fiala-rozpocet-bis.A210829_120337_domaci_vlc\">had</a> long opposed freezing the salaries of police officers and firefighters, and on the contrary, proposed a 3.5% increase in salaries for these groups.</p><p> However, former Minister Schillerová finally reversed course in September 2021 and <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/platy-statnich-zamestnancu-nakonec-vzrostou-potvrdila-poprve-schillerova-40372366\">agreed</a> to increase the salaries of all civil servants, including firefighters and police officers, although debates continued over the rate of increase. The ČSSD opposed a percentage increase and proposed a fixed monetary amount. In mid- <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3398176-zive-vlada-k-mimoradne-pomoci-kvuli-zdrazovani-energii\">November</a> , Andrej Babiš&#39;s government finally approved a blanket <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/od-ledna-se-zvysi-platy-ve-statnim-a-verejnem-sektoru-o-1-400-korun--rozhodla-vlada-191806/\">increase in civil servants&#39; salaries</a> by more than a thousand crowns, starting in January 2022.</p><p> On December 29, 2021, the government of Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/vlada-prida-socialnim-pracovnikum-zdravotnikum-a-ucitelum/2138652\">approved</a> a salary increase for only some civil servants. The new government had previously announced that it did not agree with a blanket increase. The salaries of social service workers are to increase by 700 crowns from January 2022, the salaries of healthcare workers by 6% and teachers by 2%. The government also approved an increase in the salaries of soldiers, firefighters and police officers by 700 crowns. The government of Petr Fiala decided to freeze the salaries of civil servants in ministries and other offices from January.</p><p> In the spring of last year, Alena Schillerová publicly declared that she wanted to save on the salaries of civil servants as part of the consolidation. She wanted to increase salaries only for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers. In September, she proposed increasing salaries for all civil servants. However, neither position corresponds to the move by the Fiala government. The government increased salaries for more groups of employees than Alena Schillerová proposed in the spring, but at the same time, the new cabinet increased salaries by less than the then minister had planned in September.</p><p> Petr Fiala thus incorrectly states that his government did exactly what Alena Schillerová proposed. Moreover, the Prime Minister points out the former minister&#39;s alleged hypocrisy by drawing attention to her relatively restrictive stance from the spring, but neglecting her more budgetary-relaxed position from September 2021.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

Since Deputy Neděla confirmed to us that the statements mentioned by Minister Havlíček actually occurred on the part of the Commission, we assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>In his statement, Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlíček gives an illustrative example of the increasing costs of completing the Mochovce nuclear power plant in Slovakia.</p><p> Construction of the Slovak Mochovce nuclear power plant began in 1981. The two originally planned units with a total output of 880 MW were <a href=\"https://www.skoda-js.cz/reference/jaderna-elektrarna-mochovce-2/\">completed</a> and commissioned in 1998 and 2000, respectively, while the construction of units 3 and 4, which Minister Havlíček is talking about, was <a href=\"http://www.seas.sk/data/file/87/sz-eia-mo34-sk.pdf\">suspended</a> in 1992 (.pdf, pp. 1–3) and <a href=\"http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf\">preserved</a> for a long time (.pdf, p. 11).<br/><br/> The actual construction work <a href=\"http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf\">began</a> (.pdf, p. 12) in 2008 with a planned completion date of 2013 or 2014, but there have been several delays and the construction has become more expensive, for example due to <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/slovensky-urad-zjistil-nedostatky-v-budovane-jaderne-elektrarne-1362287\">the introduction of</a> new safety features. According to the current plan, the power plant should be <a href=\"https://cz.seas.sk/jaderna-elektrarna-mochovce\">completed</a> in 2020. However, developments <a href=\"https://oenergetice.cz/rychle-zpravy/dokonceni-slovenske-jaderne-elektrarny-mochovce-se-prodrazi-a-opet-opozdi/\">indicate</a> that completion or start of operation on schedule may not happen again.</p><p> The construction of units 3 and 4 was stopped at a relatively advanced stage. At the time of the construction of the building, approximately 70% of the construction work had already <a href=\"http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf\">been completed</a> (.pdf, p. 11) and approximately 30% of the equipment had been delivered. If Minister Havlíček is talking about this basis for the construction of the nuclear power plant worth 1 to 2 billion euros, then we have not been able to verify this amount. However, given the scope of the work carried out, it is likely that the amounts involved are in the order of billions of euros, as Havlíček correctly states.</p><p> If we now take a closer look at the financing of the completion of the Mochovce power plant, the latest reported cost increase <a href=\"https://oenergetice.cz/rychle-zpravy/dokonceni-slovenske-jaderne-elektrarny-mochovce-se-prodrazi-a-opet-opozdi/\">is</a> 5.67 billion euros, which is 144.6 billion crowns at <a href=\"https://www.kurzy.cz/kurzy-men/nejlepsi-kurzy/EUR-euro/\">the exchange rate</a> of 25 November 2019. For example, in 2014, the estimated costs <a href=\"https://www.seas.sk/clanok/akcionari-schvalili-rozpocet-na-dokoncenie-mochoviec/138\">were</a> 4.6 billion euros, which would be 117.3 billion crowns at today&#39;s exchange rate. If the price of the power plant was set at 7 billion euros, the price of the power plant would be 178.5 billion crowns at today&#39;s exchange rate. Similar prices are not <a href=\"https://oenergetice.cz/jaderne-elektrarny/jake-jsou-ceny-za-jaderne-reaktory-iii-generace/\">unusual</a> .</p><p> Let us add that <a href=\"https://www.seas.sk/mochovce-3-4-npp\">the output</a> of the parts of the nuclear power plant being built should be 2 x 471 MWe, a total close to the 1000 MW stated by Havlíček.</p><p></p>\nSECTION D: <p>According to information from <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/vystavba-noveho-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan-by-mela-zacit-v-roce-2029--250598/\">the Ministry of</a> Industry and Trade (MIT), a zoning decision on the construction of a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant should be issued in 2021, a supplier should be selected by the end of 2022, construction should begin in 2029, and the investment should be completed in 2036. There is a risk that in 2040, electricity supplies would not cover consumption for 678 or even up to 3,622 hours a year, and electricity consumption would therefore have to be regulated.</p><p> According to the news website <a href=\"https://ekolist.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/zpravy/cesi-jednali-poprve-v-bruselu-o-dostavbe-jaderneho-bloku-dukovan\">Ekolist.cz,</a> a Czech delegation discussed the construction of a new nuclear unit in Dukovany in Brussels on November 20, 2019.

The European Commission issued <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/cz_rec_cz.pdf\">a recommendation</a> on this original draft on 18 June 2019.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The national energy mix <a href=\"https://www.ote-cr.cz/cs/statistika/narodni-energeticky-mix\">represents</a> the share of energy sources in a country. It is an overview of the use of energy from individual <a href=\"https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/about-energy-mix\">primary sources</a> such as fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, oil), nuclear sources and renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and others).</p><p> The resulting energy mix <a href=\"https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/about-energy-mix\">varies</a> from region to region and country. It depends on the given natural, economic and social conditions. Historical, geopolitical, environmental and other factors also play a role.</p><p> The Czech Republic&#39;s energy policy is based on <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/dokumenty/52841/60959/636207/priloha006.pdf\">the State Energy Concept of the Czech Republic</a> (.pdf). This represents a long-term national strategy that is set &quot; <em>in accordance with the long-term energy strategy of the European Union focused on decarbonization, high security of supply and competitive energy prices</em> &quot; ( <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/dokumenty/52841/60959/636207/priloha006.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 5).</p><p> European Union legislation in the field <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/cs/sheet/68/energy-policy-general-principles\">of energy</a> focuses mainly on issues of the common market and the environment.</p><p> Energy is covered by Title XXI of Part Three <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT\">of the Treaty</a> on the Functioning of the European Union. Article 194(1) of the Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">sets out</a> (.pdf, p. 134) the objectives of EU policy and its scope in the field of energy: &quot; <em>To ensure the functioning of the energy market; to ensure the security of energy supply in the Union; to promote energy efficiency and energy saving as well as the development of new and renewable energy sources; and to promote the interconnection of energy networks.</em> &quot;</p><p> Paragraph 2 of Article 194 <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">declares</a> (.pdf, p. 135) the independence of Member States in the formulation of their own energy policies. The article states that legislation and measures to achieve the objectives of paragraph 1 shall not affect &quot; <em>the right of a Member State to determine the conditions for the exploitation of its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the fundamental composition of its energy supply.</em> &quot;</p><p> There are therefore standards and regulations that influence the energy policy of individual EU member states, but the composition of the energy mix is the responsibility of the states.</p><p> One of the measures concerning the EU internal market and also affecting the energy sector is illegal aid. This is defined in Article 107 of <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT\">the Treaty</a> on the Functioning of the European Union: &quot; <em>Any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market, save as otherwise provided in the Treaties</em> &quot; ( <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">.pdf</a> , p. 91).</p><p> The Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 92) that the Commission monitors the compatibility of state aid with the internal market and may, where appropriate, order the state to abolish or adjust unlawful aid (Article 108(2)).</p><p> Furthermore, the Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 92) that “ <em>the Commission must be informed in sufficient time of any plans to grant or alter aid in order to enable it to submit its observations. If it considers that such a plan is not compatible with the internal market having regard to Article 107, it shall immediately initiate the procedure referred to in paragraph 2. The Member State concerned shall not put the envisaged measures into effect until the Commission has taken a final decision on the procedure</em> ” (Article 108(3)).</p><p> Another example of legislative criteria are environmental commitments. In 2015, the European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_15_4485\">presented</a> the so-called Energy Union, which aims to ensure a secure, sustainable, affordable and competitive energy system in the EU. There are a number of EU strategies and targets in the field of climate and energy (e.g. Energy Strategy <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2030-energy-strategy\">2030</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2050-energy-strategy\">2050</a> ).</p><p> One of the EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2030-energy-strategy\">requirements</a> is to introduce a 32% share of renewable energy sources by 2030.

According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153#p5-1-d\">Section 5,</a> the BIS provides information on activities whose consequences may threaten the security or significant economic interests of the Czech Republic. According to the official website of the BIS, a significant economic interest <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/ekonomicke-zajmy-statu/\">is understood to be</a> an interest in the functionality of systems with a broad economic reach and in the optimal management of assets, the loss of which could threaten the basic functions of the state. <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1993ps/tisky/t101600.htm\">The explanatory memorandum</a> to the Act on Intelligence Services speaks of the need to &quot; <em>detect through intelligence efforts also efforts directed against the mechanisms of the financial and economic functioning of the state in cases where their consequences may damage the interests of the Czech Republic&quot;.</em> These economic interests may be influenced, among other things, by illegal activities, which can include corruption, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the law or on the BIS website.</p><p> It cannot be ruled out that a specific case of corruption that would significantly threaten the economic interests of the Czech Republic could fall within the scope of the BIS. However, in general, the fight against economic crime is not within the scope of the BIS.

In 2018, the share of state debt to GDP was 32.6%. However, in absolute numbers, state debt is not clearly decreasing, on the contrary, it is rather fluctuating, which can be traced <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/rizeni-statniho-dluhu/dluhova-statistika/struktura-a-vyvoj-statniho-dluhu\">in the data of the Ministry of Finance</a> .

And tell me, what else but economic crime, including corruption and the fight against it, is the defense of economic interests.\nSECTION B: Well, I recommended quite publicly when he was appointed (Minister of Culture Zaorálek, note: Demagog.cz) that he realize that he can have a comfortable life, going from reception to reception, from opening to opening, from festival to festival, but that the Ministry of Culture should take care of dilapidated cultural monuments.\nSECTION C: Danuška, Dana Košanová, my little daughter, go to sleep already. I think that was a poem by Vojtěch Mihálik, who later deserted to the regime, but wrote this beautiful poem at the time. Do you know who Dana Košanová was? She has a monument now and she was shot by a Soviet soldier, no tank, Mr. Soukup, normal shooting. I don&#39;t even know if it was from behind.\nSECTION D: So I have problems with compulsory voting. I&#39;ll ignore the stupid argument that the communists introduced it. By the way, you know, right? On the contrary, they abolished Masaryk&#39;s law on compulsory voting and formally and only formally, voting was not compulsory. But something else is that under the communists, voting was enforced quite drastically, although not by law.\n\n\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

Petr Fiala stated (time 49:22) that <i>&quot;good government governs for everyone, even for those who did not vote for it&quot;</i> . He then illustrates this position by referring to his older statement from the election staff, which is the content of the verified statement.</p><p> Petr Fiala, in the SPOLU coalition&#39;s election staff, gave his first post-election speech on October 9, when <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3383514-zmeny-je-tady-my-jsme-ji-slibili-my-ji-udelame-rekl-lidr-spolu-fiala\">he said</a> (video, time 1:52): <i>&quot;(…) I would like to ask you something in this context.

Some input raw materials can also become more expensive, the main ones recently being <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/energy-chaos-adds-to-inflation-angst-for-europe-s-policy-makers?sref=qI83munY\">energy</a> , <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3379052-kremikove-trzni-peklo-zdrazil-o-tri-sta-procent-a-do-problemu-dostal-mnoho-odvetvi\">silicon</a> , <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3383072-kvuli-nedostatku-cipu-automobilky-prijdou-o-biliony-korun-nedodelana-auta-stoji\">chips</a> or <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/zdrazovani-materialu-cesko-ceny-stavba-rekonstrukce_2111021338_ern\">building materials</a> such as <a href=\"https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/\">wood</a> (video, 3:08). The costs of <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3364898-lodni-doprava-zdrazuje-za-zbozi-z-ciny-si-zakaznici-priplati-i-v-cesku\">shipping</a> and <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/silnicni-dopravci-zdrazi-az-o-ctvrtinu-40375524\">land</a> transport have also increased. Therefore, this type of inflation is called <a href=\"https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/svejnar-rozeviraji-se-nuzky-obava-o-uspory-je-namiste-inflac/r~6a91995c1be611ec8fa20cc47ab5f122/\">supply-side inflation</a> (video, 3:08), which is caused by an increase in the prices of inputs to production.</p><p> As for the domestic influences that contribute to this wave of rising inflation, we can mention, for example, the words of the head of the National Budget Council <a href=\"https://echo24.cz/a/Sx5mc/ceka-nas-to-nejhorsi-ekonomove-reaguji-na-tvrdy-boj-cnb-s-inflaci\">, Eva Zamrazilová:</a> <i>&quot;The connection between inflation and the legacy of the previous fiscal policy is obvious, and we have repeatedly pointed out this fact. The problem of inflation certainly cannot be brushed off the table by saying that it is purely global imported inflation.&quot;</i></p><p> Economist <a href=\"https://forbes.cz/horska-hleda-se-vinik-inflace-jen-globalni-problemy-za-ni-nemohou/\">Helena Horská</a> , for example, talks about the government&#39;s influence on price increases. She states that when the economy reopens, most restaurateurs, hoteliers, and service providers in general will increase their prices to offset losses from the lockdown period and meet increased deferred demand. She also adds: <i>&quot;This demand is being inflated by other factors. Specifically, the abolition of the super-gross wage, the increase in pensions beyond the framework of valorization, the abolition of the real estate acquisition tax, and other steps that have loosened budgetary discipline so much that even after the pandemic subsides, the state treasury is expected to be short of almost 400 billion crowns during the economic boom.&quot;</i> However, Helena Horská does not see government policy as the main cause of inflation.</p><p> The only government influence is a short quote <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/volby/volby-do-snemovny/vlada-je-spoluvinikem-inflace-zbytecne-utraci-dluh-statu-rychle-roste-a-je-stale-drazsi-1383895\">from Petr Kříž</a> in the daily E15, who lists high state budget deficits or rising pensions as causes. However, such statements are exceptions. According to the rest of the article and other economists cited here, however, government policy is not the main culprit of the current inflation.</p><p> The CNB <a href=\"https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/komentare-cnb-ke-zverejnenym-statistickym-udajum-o-inflaci-a-hdp/Inflace-v-zari-2021-vysoko-nad-prognozou-CNB-a-horni-hranici-tolerancniho-pasma-cile/\">sees the cause of the current high inflation elsewhere</a> than in &quot;poor state management&quot;. According to it, one of the main causes is <i>&quot;a surge in consumer demand after the dismantling of anti-epidemic measures&quot;,</i> which leads to a sharp increase in prices in the service sector, while at the same time the growth in prices of goods has accelerated, as Helena Horská also <a href=\"https://forbes.cz/horska-hleda-se-vinik-inflace-jen-globalni-problemy-za-ni-nemohou/\">states</a> . However, according to the CNB, this effect also occurs in other countries. The CNB <a href=\"https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/komentare-cnb-ke-zverejnenym-statistickym-udajum-o-inflaci-a-hdp/Inflace-v-zari-2021-vysoko-nad-prognozou-CNB-a-horni-hranici-tolerancniho-pasma-cile/\">identified</a> another significant cause of inflation as &quot; <i>the high growth in industrial producer prices in the world due to disruptions in supply chains, to which is added a significant increase in the price of many raw materials and materials&quot;.</i> At the end of its commentary, the CNB writes about <i>&quot;unexpectedly strong and widespread inflationary pressures from the domestic and foreign economies&quot;</i> . CNB Governor Rusnok has previously <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/cnb-prekvapila-uroky-vyskocily-na-150-175938\">pointed out</a> that the government&#39;s budgetary policy is at least partly causing today&#39;s level of inflation. On the other hand, CNB Councilor Aleš Michl <a href=\"https://www.cnb.cz/cs/verejnost/servis-pro-media/autorske-clanky-rozhovory-s-predstaviteli-cnb/Nesmysly-o-inflaci/\">stated</a> that the government <i>&quot;cannot really be held responsible&quot;</i> for inflation.</p><p> Petr Fiala emphasizes in his statement that economists and the Czech National Bank attribute equal credit for rising inflation to international factors and the previous government&#39;s economic management. The statements of some economists may be in line with the Prime Minister&#39;s statement, although this is clearly a minority position. However, the published positions of representatives of the Czech National Bank are completely inconsistent with the Prime Minister&#39;s statement - the Czech National Bank attributes the main responsibility for rising inflation to international influences. We therefore assess Fiala&#39;s statement as untrue.</p><p> Let us add that in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/0/2-17122021-AP-EN.pdf/ebf0659e-db3c-fc20-9faa-e74964b1827d\">November</a> (.pdf) 2021, the inflation rate in the Czech Republic was below the European Union average, at 4.8 percent. Finally, let us also state that we have verified Petr Fiala&#39;s <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/21147\">statements</a> about <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/21233\">inflation</a> in the past.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>In June 2023, the government of Petr Fiala adopted <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/zvlady/usneseni/2023/449/\">a resolution</a> ( <a href=\"https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/2023/449/pdf/\">.pdf</a> ) approving the preliminary proposal of the Ministry of Finance on the amount of state budget revenues and expenditures for 2024. This was not a finished government budget proposal, but only a <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3595254-vlada-schvalila-predbezny-navrh-rozpoctu-na-rok-2024-se-schodkem-235-miliard\">preliminary</a> plan that did not contain a detailed outline of individual components on the revenue and expenditure side. This proposal <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/ministerstvo/media/tiskove-zpravy/2023/vlada-schvalila-predpokladane-parametry-51706\">calculated</a> a deficit of CZK 235 billion. Prime Minister Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/statni-rozpocet-schodek-vlada-stanjura-fiala_2306212154_har\">added</a> to the proposal that the final budget deficit would not exceed CZK 270 billion, which the government had already set as the budget deficit <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3594452-je-jen-ramec-rekl-o-270miliardovem-deficitu-kupka-podle-havlicka-je-vlada-chaoticka\">ceiling</a> <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/vlada-schodek-snizit-na-270-miliard-korun_2306142120_hof\">before</a> adopting the resolution.</p><p> At the end <a href=\"https://www.odok.cz/portal/veklep/material/KORNCV8KBV8T/\">of August</a> , the Ministry of Finance <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/ministerstvo/media/tiskove-zpravy/2023/navrh-rozpoctu-na-rok-2024-52808\">submitted</a> to the government the final draft budget for 2024, which envisages total revenues of CZK 1,921.2 billion and expenditures of CZK 2,173.2 billion. The budget deficit is thus <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3611504-ministerstvo-predlozilo-vlade-navrh-rozpoctu-se-schodkem-252-miliard\">planned</a> at CZK 252 billion ( <a href=\"https://1drv.ms/w/s!AuXRjwyZOj5-szj-hbJ8QyXVm69H?e=n9R2tm\">.docx</a> , page 1).</p><p> To summarize, the Ministry of Finance proposed a state budget deficit of CZK 235 billion for next year. In fact, this was not a government proposal, but only a preliminary plan for the ministry. Even before the approval of this proposal, cabinet representatives stated that the deficit would not exceed CZK 270 billion. The final budget proposal for 2024 then calculates a deficit of CZK 252 billion. We therefore assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>We were unable to find the letter mentioned by Petr Fiala in publicly available sources, so we contacted the European Commission Representation in the Czech Republic to ask whether the President of the European Commission had received the letter from Prime Minister Petr Fiala with the request that Fiala was talking about.</p><p> The Head of the Representation&#39;s Press Department, <a href=\"https://czechia.representation.ec.europa.eu/novinky-udalosti/tiskove-centrum_cs\">Magdaléna Frouzová,</a> confirmed to us that European Commission President Von Der Leyen received a letter from Fiala: <i>&quot;Yes, we can confirm that the President of the Commission received a letter from the Czech Prime Minister, in which she formulates the position of the Czech government supporting the inclusion of gas and nuclear energy in the EU taxonomy, in full accordance with the resolution adopted by both chambers of the Czech Parliament on December 15, 2021.&quot;</i></p><p> Petr Fiala also refers to the resolution of the Czech Parliament in his statement. On December 14, 2021, the Chamber of Deputies <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2021ps/stenprot/004schuz/bqbs/b02100901.htm\">voted</a> on <i>the Resolution of the Parliament on the necessary role of nuclear energy in the decarbonization of the economy</i> . This is <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw?z=15300\">a resolution</a> according to which the Chamber of Deputies:</p><ul><li> notes that the Czech Republic has committed to the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal,</li><li> appreciates that the EU recognises the right of Member States to freely choose the composition of their energy mix,</li><li> stresses that the Czech Republic, due to its geographical conditions, is unable to meet its obligations without the use of nuclear energy,</li><li> recalls that the important role of nuclear energy was also confirmed by the President of the European Commission,</li><li> therefore notes that nuclear energy must be fully recognised as part of the solution for decarbonising the economy. It cannot be seen as just a &quot;transitional&quot; category, but as a tool that &quot;enables&quot; the low-carbon transformation of the economy and makes it economically and socially sustainable in the long term. The criteria for the sustainability of the low-carbon transformation of the economy should be technologically neutral and must not differentiate between generations of nuclear installations or reactor technology,</li><li> also notes that the Czech Republic intends to temporarily use natural gas in its mix,</li><li> Calls on the EU to include gas as a transitional source and nuclear energy as a sustainable source,</li><li> instructs Andrej Babiš, the outgoing Prime Minister, to present this opinion to the European Council at its meeting on 15 December 2021.</li></ul><p> The majority of deputies, with the exception of SPD representatives, voted <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=77438&amp;l=cz\">in favor of</a> this proposal. The Senate also <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/senat-ve-shode-se-snemovnou-podporil-vyuzivani-jaderne-energie/2133449\">supported</a> the Chamber of Deputies&#39; resolution the following day.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>Prime Minister Petr Fiala responds to the question of whether he plans to visit the regions in a similar way to what Interior Minister Vít Rakušan is currently doing with his <i>&quot;No Censorship&quot;</i> <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/rakusan-karvina/r~8775e82eb9bf11eebc030cc47ab5f122/\">discussions</a> or <a href=\"https://karvinsky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/babis-tour-karvinsko-tesin-havirov-napadali-priznivci-odpurci2022.html\">Andrej Babiš</a> has done in the past.

Petr Fiala, in an interview verified by us (similarly to <a href=\"https://www.blesk.cz/clanek/zpravy-politika/760375/fiala-v-blesku-zvysit-nektere-dane-bylo-nutne-odsoudil-vulgarity-pri-stavce-pavlovi-ustoupil-s-projevem.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9ETo%20nen%C3%AD%20%C5%BE%C3%A1dn%C3%A1%20farma%2C%20kter%C3%A1%20pat%C5%99%C3%AD%20panu%20Jure%C4%8Dkovi%2C%E2%80%9C%20dodal%20Fiala%20s%20t%C3%ADm%2C%20%C5%BEe%20Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Jure%C4%8Dka%20tam%20d%C4%9Bl%C3%A1%20jednoho%20z%20vedouc%C3%ADch%20a%20s%C3%A1m%20Fiala%20se%20to%20podle%20sv%C3%BDch%20slov%20dozv%C4%9Bd%C4%9Bl%20a%C5%BE%20na%20posledn%C3%AD%20chv%C3%ADli.%C2%A0\">before</a> ), stated that he did not know that Minister Jurečka&#39;s brother worked in the cooperative and only found out about it on the spot ( <a href=\"https://cnn.iprima.cz/fiala-babise-musime-porazit-i-v-pristich-volbach-spolehame-na-politicka-reseni-ne-soudy-425484\">video</a> , time 21:24).</p><p> It should be added that Prime Minister Fiala was <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/premier-petr-fiala-navsteva-druzstva-protesty-zmena-programu.A231127_133155_domaci_vank\">criticized</a> for visiting Vysočina during a trade union strike. According to Jakub Tomek from the Prime Minister&#39;s Communications Department, <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/jihlava/zpravy/premier-fiala-ministr-zemedelstvi-vyborny-navsteva-skola-pozdatin.A231127_063333_jihlava-zpravy_mv\">it was</a> a regular working visit that was in no way related to the strike in the education sector. The Agro School <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/jihlava/zpravy/premier-fiala-ministr-zemedelstvi-vyborny-navsteva-skola-pozdatin.A231127_063333_jihlava-zpravy_mv\">did not join</a> the protests, and normal classes were held there.</p><p> <strong>Summary</strong></p><p> On the day of the trade union strike, which took place on November 27, 2023, Petr Fiala first visited the Agro School in Pozątín in the Třebíč region, where he discussed with students and teachers. He then moved to the Pooslaví cooperative in Nová Ves. Minister Jurečka&#39;s brother, Lukáš Jurečka, is the director of the cooperative and in the past served as a member of the board of directors and later as vice-chairman of the board of directors. We therefore assess the Prime Minister&#39;s statement as true.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>Alena Schillerová <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/statni-zamestnanci-platy-za-rok-2020-vzrust-prumerneho-platu_2105150933_kuc\">spoke</a> about freezing the salaries of civil servants in the spring of 2021. According to the former Minister of Finance, salaries should only <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/aktualne/v-mediich/2021/schillerova-vyvoj-pandemie-rozhodne-o-no-41240\">be increased</a> for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers as part of the consolidation of public finances. Although <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/schillerova-chci-obnovit-eet-40358028\">she stated</a> several times in <a href=\"https://cnn.iprima.cz/pojdme-rusit-danove-vyjimky-vyzvala-alena-schillerova-dane-pry-zvysovat-nechce-23442\">April</a> that she did not want to reduce the salaries of firefighters and police officers, she did not talk about increasing their salaries.</p><p> Let us also add that in <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3326254-odbory-kritizuji-plan-na-zmrazeni-platu-statnich-zamestnancu-schillerova-na-nem\">June 2021</a> , the government of Andrej Babiš approved a draft state budget, which envisaged that the salary freeze would apply not only to civil servants, but also to police officers, firefighters and soldiers. The only exception was to be teachers&#39; salaries. Alena Schillerová stated at the time that the government could not afford to increase the salaries of civil servants due to the high state budget deficit.</p><p> The then Minister of the Interior, Hamáček, <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/hamacek-rakusan-fiala-rozpocet-bis.A210829_120337_domaci_vlc\">had</a> long opposed freezing the salaries of police officers and firefighters, and on the contrary, proposed a 3.5% increase in salaries for these groups.</p><p> However, former Minister Schillerová finally reversed course in September 2021 and <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/platy-statnich-zamestnancu-nakonec-vzrostou-potvrdila-poprve-schillerova-40372366\">agreed</a> to increase the salaries of all civil servants, including firefighters and police officers, although debates continued over the rate of increase. The ČSSD opposed a percentage increase and proposed a fixed monetary amount. In mid- <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3398176-zive-vlada-k-mimoradne-pomoci-kvuli-zdrazovani-energii\">November</a> , Andrej Babiš&#39;s government finally approved a blanket <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/od-ledna-se-zvysi-platy-ve-statnim-a-verejnem-sektoru-o-1-400-korun--rozhodla-vlada-191806/\">increase in civil servants&#39; salaries</a> by more than a thousand crowns, starting in January 2022.</p><p> On December 29, 2021, the government of Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/vlada-prida-socialnim-pracovnikum-zdravotnikum-a-ucitelum/2138652\">approved</a> a salary increase for only some civil servants. The new government had previously announced that it did not agree with a blanket increase. The salaries of social service workers are to increase by 700 crowns from January 2022, the salaries of healthcare workers by 6% and teachers by 2%. The government also approved an increase in the salaries of soldiers, firefighters and police officers by 700 crowns. The government of Petr Fiala decided to freeze the salaries of civil servants in ministries and other offices from January.</p><p> In the spring of last year, Alena Schillerová publicly declared that she wanted to save on the salaries of civil servants as part of the consolidation. She wanted to increase salaries only for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers. In September, she proposed increasing salaries for all civil servants. However, neither position corresponds to the move by the Fiala government. The government increased salaries for more groups of employees than Alena Schillerová proposed in the spring, but at the same time, the new cabinet increased salaries by less than the then minister had planned in September.</p><p> Petr Fiala thus incorrectly states that his government did exactly what Alena Schillerová proposed. Moreover, the Prime Minister points out the former minister&#39;s alleged hypocrisy by drawing attention to her relatively restrictive stance from the spring, but neglecting her more budgetary-relaxed position from September 2021.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: There were some property disputes there (at TV NOVA, note: Demagog.cz) and unfortunately we had to pay a fine of 10 billion crowns also because some institution, I don&#39;t know now if it was the media committee of the Chamber of Deputies or someone like that, said that everything was fine. So we agreed to it, and well, it wasn&#39;t fine.\nSECTION B: Danuška, Dana Košanová, my little daughter, go to sleep already. I think that was a poem by Vojtěch Mihálik, who later deserted to the regime, but wrote this beautiful poem at the time. Do you know who Dana Košanová was? She has a monument now and she was shot by a Soviet soldier, no tank, Mr. Soukup, normal shooting. I don&#39;t even know if it was from behind.\nSECTION C: Well, I recommended quite publicly when he was appointed (Minister of Culture Zaorálek, note: Demagog.cz) that he realize that he can have a comfortable life, going from reception to reception, from opening to opening, from festival to festival, but that the Ministry of Culture should take care of dilapidated cultural monuments.\nSECTION D: When I recently told him (the director of the BIS Koudelka, note: Demagog.cz) that he should deal more with economic crime, the BIS spokesperson said that economic crime is not in the BIS job description, which means we have a stupid spokesperson here who doesn&#39;t even know the BIS Act, which includes the obligation to protect the economic interests of the Czech Republic. And tell me, what else but economic crime, including corruption and the fight against it, is the defense of economic interests.\nSECTION E: Let me start the same way I did when I met with about a hundred foreign ambassadors. I said to them: Welcome to a successful country. A country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, that has stable economic growth, that has a relatively declining and relatively low national debt. A country where both the average wage and old-age pensions are growing.\nSECTION F: On the other hand, those who babble that it is nationalization should realize that a similar position was taken by the American administration, which you certainly cannot suspect of Bolshevism. For example, with General Motors. So they entered there and when General Motors got back on its feet, they sold their share again. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

This is only apparent from his answers, which contain expressions such as &quot; <i>generally speaking, I can note for the KSČM...&quot;</i> etc.</p><p> The newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda <a href=\"http://redstar.ru/o-gazete/\">has been published</a> since 2018 with the subtitle Newspaper of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and was previously also the central press organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense. It is therefore possible to describe it as a military newspaper, as Vít Rakušan states. His description of this periodical as a magazine is somewhat more problematic, as the aforementioned subtitle already suggests, Krasnaya Zvezda describes itself as a newspaper.

Only one of the following statemnts is relevant to the summary:\nSECTION A: ...and I discussed it with him (Wolfgang Schäuble - note: Demagogue) and he always understood us, he saw it at the press conference and said yes, here is the Czech Republic, and the V4 have a different history, they don&#39;t have the multicultural model and we don&#39;t want it, because the foreigners haven&#39;t been integrated in the individual states. \nSECTION B: On April 24, a petition demanding Stanek&#39;s dismissal was created, and on April 28, the vice-chairman of the ČSSD Onderka began demanding the dismissal of his own minister, contrary to the position of his own chairman. On May 2, I received the petition signatories at the Government Office, and Mr. Hamáček, who stood up for Stanek, was also at the meeting with them.\n\nSECTION C: And then there is Libya. That is the biggest problem. There is not actually one government there, there are elections coming up, the Libyan guard, which we helped as part of Operation Sofia, is very effective. It is holding the ships, 84% and they didn&#39;t have oil in August. So Prime Minister Conte was dealing with oil, because it is a state-owned company, but the government was not able to force them to give the Libyan guard oil so that they could hold the ships.\nSECTION D: ...And I was with the admiral who is in charge of Operation Sofia.... We don&#39;t have the permission of the Libyan government, we don&#39;t have the permission of the UN Security Council, so the admiral is operating in that area, but he can&#39;t fight the smugglers on Libyan territory. So what is he doing? He says here that I have destroyed 551 ships and detained 151 migrants. But he will first save the ship and they are not random castaways, according to maritime law. They go there on purpose, yes. And by the way, there are still those non-profit ships waiting there that send signals: come, come, we are waiting. So they have to transport them to the port, the migrants are excited, within two hours, they have already tried it. They will say, well, that&#39;s the smuggler, he was on the ship with us. The smugglers then go to prison and then they destroy the ship. So this is really not like a systemic solution. There&#39;s a mafia here, they only trade in people and even oil and so on.\nSECTION E: He (Miloš Zeman, note: Demagog.cz) was known to Mr. Sobotka, who first went to the president with the nomination of Mr. Prouza to head the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and when he told Sobotka that he would never appoint Prouza, he came up with another name and did not even propose Prouza. It was the same with my dismissal, which he did not push through, so I resigned myself.\nSECTION F: Look at how we are increasing pensions. Here we are, the coalition government, we haven&#39;t had time yet. And here we are, 2018, 475 crowns and this is the proposal of the minority government of the ANO movement. That, my government, which ruled brilliantly for 205 days, without confidence, but it worked perfectly, is increasing 918 crowns on average per month and another 1,000 crowns for pensioners aged 85. \n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
