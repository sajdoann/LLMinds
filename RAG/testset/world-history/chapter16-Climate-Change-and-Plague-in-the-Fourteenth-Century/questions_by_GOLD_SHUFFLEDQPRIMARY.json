This issue is addressed by special units of the Czech Police.&quot;</em></p><p> The status and scope of the BIS are determined by Act <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153\">No. 153/1994 Coll.</a> on the Intelligence Services of the Czech Republic. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153#p5-1-d\">Section 5,</a> the BIS provides information on activities whose consequences may threaten the security or significant economic interests of the Czech Republic. According to the official website of the BIS, a significant economic interest <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/ekonomicke-zajmy-statu/\">is understood to be</a> an interest in the functionality of systems with a broad economic reach and in the optimal management of assets, the loss of which could threaten the basic functions of the state. <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1993ps/tisky/t101600.htm\">The explanatory memorandum</a> to the Act on Intelligence Services speaks of the need to &quot; <em>detect through intelligence efforts also efforts directed against the mechanisms of the financial and economic functioning of the state in cases where their consequences may damage the interests of the Czech Republic&quot;.</em> These economic interests may be influenced, among other things, by illegal activities, which can include corruption, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the law or on the BIS website.</p><p> It cannot be ruled out that a specific case of corruption that would significantly threaten the economic interests of the Czech Republic could fall within the scope of the BIS.

On August 21, 1968, in the afternoon, she was <a href=\"http://okupace.evangnet.cz/kosanova-margita\">hit</a> by fire from Soviet soldiers on the steps of Comenius University in Bratislava. With a serious injury to her lumbar region, she was transported to the II. Surgical Department of the Faculty Hospital in Partyzánská Street in Bratislava, where she died the same day despite the care provided.

Welcome to a country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, stable economic growth, and very low national debt.&quot;</em> He did not mention the declining national debt at the time.</p><p> We consider the opening words to be true in terms of content as well. The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is indeed the lowest in the European Union. According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics\">Eurostat data from October 2019</a> , it is 2.2%, while the average unemployment rate in the EU-28 is 6.3%.</p><p> If we measure economic growth by GDP, then the Czech Republic is truly in a period of growth. According to <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/92010940/chmu100119.xlsx/d8a25f9f-e671-4fd1-a1f7-0b090610fbbd?version=1.0\">Czech Statistical Office data</a> (.xlsx), GDP has been growing by at least 2.5% year-on-year since 2013.</p><p> President Miloš Zeman says that the state debt is relatively decreasing and low. It is true that in relative terms of state debt to GDP, the debt is indeed decreasing. As can be seen <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">in Eurostat data</a> , this trend has been evident since 2013, when the debt was at 44.9%. In 2018, the share of state debt to GDP was 32.6%. However, in absolute numbers, state debt is not clearly decreasing, on the contrary, it is rather fluctuating, which can be traced <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/rizeni-statniho-dluhu/dluhova-statistika/struktura-a-vyvoj-statniho-dluhu\">in the data of the Ministry of Finance</a> . According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">Eurostat data,</a> the debt of the Czech Republic is one of the lowest in the EU. The average share of state debt to GDP in the EU is 80.4%. Estonia and Bulgaria, for example, have lower relative state debt than the Czech Republic.</p><p> The average wage growth is reported <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/prace_a_mzdy_prace\">by the Czech Statistical Office</a> . In the 3rd quarter of 2019, the average wage reached CZK 33,697 (increased by 6.9% year-on-year).</p><p> The growth of old-age pensions can be monitored, for example, <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/statni-rozpocet/hospodareni-systemu-duchodoveho-pojisten\">on data from the Ministry of Finance</a> . In 2016, the average old-age pension was CZK 11,460, in 2017 it was CZK 11,850, and in 2018 the average old-age pension reached CZK 12,418.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>To evaluate this statement, we will use only a quote from the Constitution of the Czech Republic. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl68\">Article 68</a> , which states:</p><p> <i>“(1) The Government is responsible to the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> <i>(2) The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President of the Republic and, upon his proposal, shall appoint the other members of the Government and entrust them with the management of ministries or other offices.</i></p><p> <i>(3) The Government shall appear before the Chamber of Deputies within thirty days of its appointment and request a vote of confidence.</i></p><p> <i>(4) If the newly appointed government does not gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the procedure shall be as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. If the government thus appointed also fails to gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Republic shall appoint the Prime Minister on the proposal of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> It is precisely the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned article in the Constitution that describes that in the event of a vote of no confidence being cast on the first attempt, the same procedure is followed again. However, if a vote of no confidence is cast on the second attempt, a third attempt follows, during which the power to select the Prime Minister lies with the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> Let us add that this constitutional procedure gives the President of the Republic considerable room for discretion. In particular, the Constitution does not dictate to the President who should be appointed Prime Minister in each attempt to form a government. As a rule, this is the chairman of the party that won the election, but as Miloš Zeman mentions in a verified interview, the coalition potential of individual parliamentary parties also plays a role. Let us recall the parliamentary elections in 2010, when the ČSSD won, but President Klaus instead of Bohuslav Sobotka <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sanci-vyjednat-vladu-ma-necas-sobotku-klaus-zklamal/r~i:article:670008/\">entrusted</a> the formation of the government to the chairman of <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2010/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">the second</a> ODS, Petr Nečas, whom he subsequently <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/klaus-jmenoval-necase-premierem-45608\">appointed</a> Prime Minister.</p><p> A similar case occurred in 2013 after the fall of the Nečas government, when the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Miroslava Němcová had 101 parliamentary signatures in support of a possible new government, but President Zeman instead <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1090181-vladu-sestavi-ekonom-rusnok-rozhodl-zeman\">tasked</a> Jiří Rusnok with forming a caretaker government and subsequently <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/-vladu-odborniku-povede-rusnok-prezident-zeman-ho-jmenoval-premierem_201306251920_mskalicky\">appointed</a> him prime minister.</p><p> Even in the second attempt to appoint a prime minister who will form a government with confidence, there is no stipulation as to who should be appointed, especially that it should be the “second in line.” In 2018, for example, President Zeman <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/premier-andrej-babis-prezident-milos-zeman-podruhe_1806061400_ako\">appointed</a> Andrej Babiš as prime minister even after his government failed to win confidence in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The ruling <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-za-novu-do-konce-dubna.A030318_144623_domaci_has\">refers</a> to property disputes from 1999 to 2003 between TV Nova CEO Vladimír Železný (or CET 21, the broadcasting license <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/zelezny-prejmenuje-cet-21-na-tv-nova.A_990419_170757_domaci_jpl\">holder</a> ) and American investors (CME). CME claims that its investments in TV Nova were <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/cesko-musi-cme-zaplatit-10-miliard-korun_200303151837_mtaborska\">damaged</a> by Vladimír Železný&#39;s attempt to cut off foreign investors.</p><p> CEO Železný was <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-kvuli-nove-miliardy.A030314_200747_domaci_jpl\">supported</a> in his attempt to spin off TV Nova from CME in 1999 by the Radio and Television Broadcasting Council, which is vaguely referred to in the ruling. These circumstances resulted in arbitration proceedings (or arbitral proceedings) that ended against the Czech Republic, which had <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/assets/cs/media/Dohoda_DPOI-USA-cesky.pdf\">an obligation</a> (.pdf) to protect American foreign investments. The victorious company CME <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/rozhodnuto-cesko-za-arbitraz-zaplatilo.A030515_095759_domaci_has\">received</a> over 10 billion crowns from the state in the arbitration dispute.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>General Motors is an American multinational corporation that is one of the world&#39;s largest car manufacturers. However, it ran into major problems, among other things due to the effects of the global economic crisis of 2008. GM has had enough of its own problems over the past decade, such as a constantly declining market share, with the price per share gradually <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/05/31/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy_looms/index.htm?postversion=2009053112\">falling</a> to almost 75 cents. </p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/chart_gm_shrinking.03.gif\"><figcaption> Source: <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/\">CNN</a></figcaption></figure><p> But the Great Recession also meant that car sales dropped significantly. All of these factors led GM to declare <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/ceska-ekonomika/obri-bankrot-automobilky-je-tu-gm-chce-ochranu/r~i:article:638814/?redirected=1532723355\">bankruptcy</a> on June 1, 2009. On the same day, the company filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. The administration of then-President Barack Obama bailed out GM with a nearly $50 billion <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">injection</a> of cash, for which it acquired a 60.8% stake in the company. Canada also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1405425-automobilka-general-motors-zbankrotovala\">bought</a> part of the company, and the United Auto Workers union bought another part. The United States then gradually sold off this stake, for which it collected $39 billion. The last part of its stake <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/12/09/government-treasury-gm-general-motors-tarp-bailout-exit-sale/3925515/\">was sold by</a> the United States in December 2013.</p><p> General Motors remained in bankruptcy for only 39 days and soon returned to the stock market thanks to reorganization. As part of the restructuring, the company <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">stopped</a> production of some unprofitable brands such as Hummer, Pontiac and Saturn. The company also closed some of its factories and focused on a narrower selection of brands - such as Chevrolet and Cadillac. The US entry into car manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler ultimately saved 1.5 million jobs. It is estimated that the US <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-bailout-study-idUSL1N0JO0XU20131209\">saved</a> $ 105 billion in collecting social security payments and social benefits for people who would have lost their jobs due to the bankruptcy.</p><p> The Czech Republic can help Czech companies in this way. <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66746670-vlada-hodla-vstoupit-do-vyznamnych-soukromych-firem\">According to</a> Deputy Prime Minister Karel Havlíček, this would be a similar model to that outlined by Miloš Zeman using the example of the USA and General Motors. &quot; <i>We call it the American model, it is not socialization, as we are now being criticized a lot.&quot;</i> Many states are trying to save their strategic companies in this way, as are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesasquith/2020/04/01/could-airlines-be-nationalised-as-italy-takes-full-ownership-of-alitalia-will-more-airlines-follow/#59f3640877df\">airlines</a> .</p><p> Finance Minister Alena Schillerová and the government of Andrej Babiš have <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66751220-schillerova-chce-zestatnovat\">proposed</a> that shares in some Czech companies, such as CSA, should be bought back and then <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66749800-deficit-200-miliard-i-pristi-rok\">sold</a> again, following the American model. Czech Airlines <a href=\"https://www.lidovky.cz/byznys/doprava/zachrana-csa-verdikt-zrejme-padne-do-dvou-tydnu.A200416_130657_ln-doprava_ele\">is</a> currently 98 percent owned by Smartwings, 49 percent of which is owned by the Chinese state-owned company CITIC. However, this proposal is criticized by many economists and experts who do not consider CSA to be a strategic enterprise, and <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/koronahelpdesk-e15/v-cesku-zadna-strategicka-firma-ke-znarodneni-neni-shoduje-se-opozice-s-analytiky-1368824\">the opposition</a> is also opposed.

Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) is talking about the length of processing applications for housing allowance, not the time period between processing the application and payment of the allowance – the editor is asking about the system of granting social benefits, not about their payment. Jurečka, with his words <i>“we pay housing allowance within the deadlines set by law”</i> , clearly points out that timely processing of the application helps to pay the allowance for the retroactively recognised period within the deadline set by law. However, he then refers the mentioned number of days to the length of the procedure itself. Let us note that the deadline for processing an application for housing allowance is <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p71-3\">30 days</a> according to the Administrative Code, or up to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p71-3-a\">60 days</a> if it is a complex case or if the Labour Office has to <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/socialni-davky-prispevek-na-bydleni-zpozdeni-urad-prace-jurecka_2303291008_ako\">conduct</a> a social investigation ( <a href=\"https://www.ochrance.cz/letaky/rizeni-o-davkach-pomoci-v-hn/rizeni-o-davkach-pomoci-v-hn.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 2).</p><p> We could not find any statistics in publicly available sources that would discuss the length of processing an application for housing allowance. We therefore asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MLSA) to send us the data that Minister Jurečka draws on in his statement. We subsequently received a graph with internal data from the MLSA, which documents the average processing time for applications for housing allowance within the individual regional directorates of the Labour Office in the period from June 1 to July 28 of this year.</p><p> However, the average processing time does not in itself exclude the possibility that in individual cases applications could be processed beyond the legally prescribed deadline. Likewise, the graph did not in any way support Minister Jurečka&#39;s claim that <i>&quot;in 98 percent of cases</i> (application processing takes around the 30-day mark, note: Demagog.cz) <i>it is only because we have asked the client to deliver something to us, and he has not yet provided us with the requested document or information.&quot;</i></p><p> We therefore contacted the Ministry again with a request for statistics on all cases where the deadline was met and when it was not, as well as for supporting the claim about the reasons for the time limit for processing applications for the allowance in Prague. However, we have not received another response, and we therefore consider the statement to be unverifiable.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka already <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/ekonomika-jurecka-duchodovy-vek-bude-podle-profese-a-vzdelani-40422115\">mentioned</a> in February that nothing would change for people born before 1973 as part of <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3564561-dnesni-tricatniky-ceka-penze-v-68-letech-ukazuje-interni-dokument-ministerstva-prace\">the planned</a> pension <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3455032-vlada-chysta-zmenu-duchodoveho-systemu-navrhuje-drivejsi-penzi-u-narocnych-profesi\">reform</a> . A few days later, Minister Jurečka also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3565087-posun-duchodoveho-veku-nad-65-let-se-podle-fialy-tykal-tech-kdo-pujdou-do-penze-za\">spoke out</a> towards younger generations: <i>&quot;If we continued and did nothing like our predecessors did, young people simply would not have a decent pension.&quot;</i></p><p> Similarly, Prime Minister Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3565087-posun-duchodoveho-veku-nad-65-let-se-podle-fialy-tykal-tech-kdo-pujdou-do-penze-za\">spoke</a> to Czech Television in February, specifically talking about <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/duchod-odchod-68-let-cesi-penze-vek-duchodci_2302122005_ula\">a possible</a> postponement of retirement: <i>&quot;It cannot apply to people who are about to retire. That is out of the question. (…) It would have to be long-term – for people who will retire in twenty or thirty years.&quot;</i></p><p> The Minister of Finance Zbyněk Stanjura (ODS) also spoke about the pension reform on the ČT24 program Interview, back in January, when he specifically <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3558744-vlada-lidem-penize-nedava-jen-jim-bere-mene-rika-stanjura\">said</a> (video, time 27:57): <i>&quot;It will probably not, a possible change in the rules, affect people who have a few years until retirement, because (...) they will not be given enough time to, for example, change their behavior, for example, save more. It will primarily affect the generation of about 50 minus, maybe 45 minus.&quot;</i></p>\nSECTION C: <p>In the context of the statement, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) describes the demographic development and changes in the behavior of Czech society, which, according to him, necessitate a pension reform and an increase in the retirement age ( <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1096898594-udalosti-komentare/224411000371030/\">video</a> , time: 22:50). According to Jurečka, a recent projection by demographers shows, for example, that the number of people of working age who <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/myty-fakta-duchody#:~:text=FAKT%3A%20LID%C3%89%20V,na%20d%C5%AFchodov%C3%A9%20poji%C5%A1t%C4%9Bn%C3%AD\">finance</a> the pension system through pension contributions will decrease. In this context, Jurečka also claims that the latest projection assumes even worse development than the projections from previous years.</p><p> <strong>Demographic projection of the Czech Statistical Office</strong></p><p> The Czech Statistical Office (CZSO) publishes a demographic projection every five years ( <a href=\"https://www.rozpoctovarada.cz/ke-stazeni/informacni-studie-alternativni-demograficke-projekce/\">.pdf</a> , p. 3). <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/projekce-obyvatelstva-ceske-republiky-2023-2100\">The last</a> projection was published in 2023, the previous one in <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/produkty/projekce-obyvatelstva-ceske-republiky-2018-2100\">2018.</a> This task <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1991-582#p10b-1\">is assigned</a> to it by the Act on the Organization and Implementation of Social Security. The projection is intended to include the expected development of mortality, fertility and migration in the Czech Republic.</p><p> The Czech Statistical Office processes population projections in three variants – medium, low and high ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 1). These variants differ mainly in the projected number of the Czech Republic&#39;s population – in the medium variant it is stable, in the high variant it is growing, in the low variant it is decreasing ( <a href=\"https://www.rozpoctovarada.cz/ke-stazeni/informacni-studie-alternativni-demograficke-projekce/\">.pdf</a> , p. 3). The authors of the Czech Statistical Office studies state that the medium variant represents the most likely scenario for future population development ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 1). We will therefore base our assessment of Marian Jurečka&#39;s statement on data from this medium variant, comparing data from projections from 2018 and 2023.</p><p> <strong>Life expectancy</strong></p><p> Life expectancy at birth is <a href=\"https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Nad%C4%9Bje_do%C5%BEit%C3%AD\">an indicator of</a> life expectancy, which indicates the average age a child born in a given generation will live to. Marian Jurečka claims that <i>&quot;we will live to an even older age&quot;,</i> meaning that life expectancy will increase.</p><p> According to the latest projection by the Czech Statistical Office, life expectancy in the Czech Republic has actually been increasing since 1989, with the exception of higher mortality in 2020–2022 associated with the Covid-19 pandemic ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 5). Although this increase has been slowing down over the years, between 2023 and 2050, life expectancy should increase by 5.2 years to 82.2 years for men and by 4.1 years to 87.1 years for women ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 6). In contrast, the projection from 2018 ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 4) assumed a slower increase in expected life expectancy. However, as the following table shows, the older projection does not fundamentally differ from the newer one, especially in the case of data for the period of the next approximately 35 years. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" data-external=\"1\" height=\"430\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1ylDB/6/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-1ylDB\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" title=\"Life expectancy of men and women (CZSO projections 2018 and 2023)\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> <strong>Number of people of working age</strong></p><p> The productive component of the population is the age <a href=\"https://ghostarchive.org/archive/sI84D\">group</a> between 15 and 64.

The latest projection of the Czech Statistical Office predicted an increase for 2023 and 2024 ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 13).</p><p> The working-age population is projected to begin declining in the mid-1930s ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 14). By the end of the 2050s, it should fall to 6 million from the current 6.87 million. By the end of the century, according to the mid-range demographic projection from 2023, the number of working-age people will decrease to 5.39 million ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 14).</p><p> In addition to these numbers, the projections also indicate the share of the working-age population in the total population ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 11, <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 14). This value is crucial for the state of the pension system, as it shows how large a part of society will be able <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/myty-fakta-duchody#:~:text=FAKT%3A%20LID%C3%89%20V,na%20d%C5%AFchodov%C3%A9%20poji%C5%A1t%C4%9Bn%C3%AD\">to earn</a> on pensions. The projections from 2018 ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 11) and 2023 ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 14) assume that the share of the working-age population will decline, especially in the next 40 years, but the individual documents mention slightly different figures.</p><p> As can be seen in the graph below, for the period 2031–2071, the newer projection shows a higher share of the population of working age than the previous CZSO projection. <i>&quot;From the perspective of the pension system&quot;</i> , which Marian Jurečka is talking about, the newer projection for the next 50 years shows better results than the projection from 2018. The new projection assumes worse numbers compared to the older one only in the years 2081–2101. </p><figure class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"border:none;min-width:100% !important;width:0;\" data-external=\"1\" height=\"379\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NoOr3/1/\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-NoOr3\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" title=\"Proportion of working-age population\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></figure><p> <strong>Birth rate, fertility</strong></p><p> The birth rate <a href=\"https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~mak/gos/demmetodika/www.czso.cz/cz/cisla/0/02/020100/narozeni.htm#:~:text=Po%C4%8Det%20%C5%BEiv%C4%9B%20narozen%C3%BDch%20d%C4%9Bt%C3%AD%2C%20p%C5%99ipadaj%C3%ADc%C3%AD%20na%201000%20obyvatel%20st%C5%99edn%C3%ADho%20stavu.\">indicates</a> the number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants. The fertility rate makes this figure <a href=\"https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Porodnost\">more precise</a> by expressing the number of these children per thousand women of reproductive age. Statistics also calculate it directly by age (e.g. for women aged 20, 21, etc.). The sum of fertility rates for all age groups (divided by a thousand) expresses the intensity of fertility in the population and indicates the average number of live births per woman, the so-called total fertility.</p><p> Total fertility is an indicator that is <a href=\"https://encyklopedie.soc.cas.cz/w/Porodnost\">suitable</a> , for example, for international comparison. A value of 2.1 children per woman is generally considered sufficient to prevent population decline. If the value falls below 2.1, the population decreases in the long term, and vice versa. In his statement, Marian Jurečka is clearly confusing the terms total fertility and birth rate. According to the latest data from the Czech Statistical Office, the birth rate in 2023 reached about 8.4 per thousand ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/d5c66500-c681-32b9-907d-4158ccceefb9/13006924.pdf?version=1.1\">.pdf</a> , pp. 5, 36). This is therefore a completely different figure than the one Minister Jurečka is talking about.</p><p> According to CZSO data, fertility fell significantly in the 1990s, then rose again in the first two decades of the 21st century ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 2) and remained at 1.71 between 2018 and 2020. A year later, it even increased to 1.83. Then, however, there was a decline - in 2022 to 1.62 and in 2023 to <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/narozeni?pocet=10&amp;start=0&amp;podskupiny=133&amp;razeni=-datumVydani\">1.45 children</a> per woman.</p><p> The CZSO projection from November 2023, based on the current data at that time, estimated that the total fertility rate for 2023 would be 1.5 children per woman ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/de376ac6-82c8-1856-dc1f-ffecc8b88b34/13013923.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 2). In the middle, most likely variant of the CZSO projection, the CZSO assumes that fertility will reach the same value in the following years (p. 3). In contrast, the previous projection from 2018 assumed a gradual stabilization at 1.74 children per woman ( <a href=\"https://csu.gov.cz/docs/107508/73b20901-b471-9635-8861-0ccbaa3f34c3/13013918u.pdf?version=1.0\">.pdf</a> , p. 2).</p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) summarizes the conclusions of the Czech Statistical Office regarding the three aforementioned indicators – life expectancy, the number of people of working age and total fertility, which he confuses with the term <i>“birth rate”</i> . He correctly states that according to the Czech Statistical Office’s projection from 2023, life expectancy will increase, the number of people of working age will decrease and total fertility will stabilize at 1.5 children per woman.</p><p> In the statement, however, it primarily compares the CZSO projections from 2023 and 2018 and says that the newer document assumes worse results <i>&quot;from the perspective of the pension system&quot;</i> than the previous estimates. Compared to the older one, the newest projection does indeed assume a faster decline in the fertility rate and a slightly higher increase in life expectancy. In the key category of the share of the population in the working age group, however, the 2023 projection shows worse results only for the last 20 years of this century, while for the years 2031–2071 (i.e. for the next 50 years) it assumes better development than the older projection. We therefore assess the statement as misleading.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) is responding to criticism from ANO MP Klára Dostálová, who commented in the debate on the government&#39;s poor communication regarding the planned adjustment of the parameters for regular pension valorization. According to MP Dostálová, Marian Jurečka wants to submit this change too quickly, which is why there will be no time for thorough discussions with the opposition. The head of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs responded by saying that he is not going to submit the amendment in the near future, and noted that he has previously objected to such information.</p><p> <strong>Statement on the negotiations in the week of March 20-26</strong></p><p> First of all, let us mention that the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MLSA) Eva Davidová <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230327123710/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2340047\">told</a> ČTK on Friday, March 17, 2023, that the government could discuss the amendment that would amend the rules for pension valorization as early as the week of March 20-26. Eva Davidová also expressed the same opinion on <a href=\"https://cnn.iprima.cz/porady/zpravy/17032023-0\">CNN Prima News</a> (video, 13:54–15:00).

It often sends these really important materials late and denies its own words.&quot;</i></p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Spokesperson for the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs Eva Davidová told ČTK on Friday, March 17, that Petr Fiala&#39;s government is preparing to discuss the proposal for changing the rules for valorization of pensions in the week from March 20 to 26. Later that same day, however, Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka said that the cabinet would not discuss the proposal in that week. According to him, negotiations with representatives of the opposition, unions and employers should first take place and only then should the proposal be sent to the commenting office. Only then should the government discuss possible changes to the valorization.</p><p> A similar situation occurred in the case of the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs that the government would approve the adjustment of valorizations at the beginning of April. Marian Jurečka actually wrote on Twitter under Alena Schillerová&#39;s post that the proposal would first be discussed with the opposition and other partners. For these reasons, we assess the statement as true.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>Following its meeting on April 27, 2022, the government <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/vlada-prodiskutovala-tzv--balicek-rodinne-pomoci--schvalila-i-pomoc-socialnim-sluzbam-s-pokrytim-zvysenych-nakladu-na-peci-o-uprchliky-195891/\">announced</a> a set of measures at a press conference to help families with children cope with high inflation and rising energy prices.

According to the previously valid <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22604\">rules</a> , the average pension should have increased by <a href=\"https://www.penize.cz/starobni-duchod/439182-zvyseni-duchodu-v-cervnu-spocitejte-si-rozdil-valorizace\">CZK 1,770</a> .

According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#f1609384\">Act</a> No. 90/1995 Coll., on the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies, such a state can <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#p99-1\">be declared</a> in an extraordinary moment &quot; <i>when the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens or the security of the state are fundamentally threatened or when the state is threatened with significant economic damage</i> &quot;. The opposition wants to refute the government&#39;s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230403130212/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2329976\">argument</a> that the state of legislative emergency was declared precisely because of the risk of &quot;major economic damage&quot;, as it <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">believes</a> that this was unjustified.</p><p> Opposition parties <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">can</a> submit a proposal from March 20, when the amendment <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">was published</a> in <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392\">the Collection of Laws</a> . According to the chairwoman of the ANO parliamentary group, Alena Schillerová, the proposal could <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">reach</a> the Constitutional Court in early May. The movement&#39;s deputy chairman, Radek Vondráček, <a href=\"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022\">said</a> on March 19 that this could happen within a month.</p><p> After considering the proposal, the Constitutional Court then <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p70-1\">decides</a> whether the law or its individual provisions are in conflict with the Constitution. If the constitutional order has been violated, the court may annul the law in question (in this case, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392\">the amendment</a> to the Act on Lower Pension Valorization) and order the relevant state body to restore the situation prior to the violation of the Constitution. However, in the past, although the Constitutional Court did not consider a decision to be unconstitutional, it published <i>an obiter dictum</i> , which is <a href=\"https://www.ceska-justice.cz/2020/04/praha-7-ustavni-stiznost-kvuli-koronavirovym-opatrenim-nestahne-jde-nam-judikat-budoucna-tvrdi-starosta-i-pravnici/\">a non-authoritative</a> statement beyond the basic reasoning ( <a href=\"https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 11).</p><p> <strong>Finding to declare a state of emergency</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka mentions the case law when the Constitutional Court found doubts about the method of extending the state of emergency. This <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/ustavni-soud-zamitl-zadost-senatoru-unor-nouzovy-stav_2103251028_btk\">happened,</a> for example, in March 2021. At that time, the Constitutional Court was considering a proposal by a group of senators to annul the resolution <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2018-cr/andrej-babis-ii/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-27-6-2018-trva-175411/\">of the government of</a> Andrej Babiš (ANO) due to the declaration of a state of emergency at the request of the governors, which occurred immediately after the proposal to extend the previous state of emergency was not passed<a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koronavirus-v-cesku-nouzovy-stav-senat_2102171308_pj\">by the Chamber of Deputies</a> .</p><p> The Constitutional Court rejected the proposal ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 1) stating that it was not within its competence to decide on such a proposal (.pdf, p. 7. 12). However, as <i>an obiter dictum</i> , it stated ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 7) that &quot; <i>a state of emergency cannot be &#39;newly&#39; declared by the government from the moment the &#39;authorized&#39; state of emergency has ended and the Chamber of Deputies has not agreed to its extension</i> &quot;. As part of <i>the obiter dictum</i> , the Constitutional Court can therefore submit a non-binding statement ( <a href=\"https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 11) or a recommendation for the legislative process.</p><p> Let us add that in the debate with Minister Jurečka, the moderator asked about option B in the event that the Constitutional Court &quot;swept away&quot; the amendment, that is, if it recognized it as unconstitutional, and thus ordered the government to restore the status quo before the violation of the constitutional system. In such a case, the situation described by Marian Jurečka, that the Constitutional Court would <i>not &quot;change the essence&quot;</i> of the amendment, would not occur. Since the decisions of the Constitutional Court are <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/postaveni-a-pravomoci\">binding</a> , <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71\">the amended</a> law would have to return to its original form.</p><p> <strong>Finding on the amendment to the pandemic law</strong></p><p> In 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf\">.pdf</a> ) in a similar case, where a group of deputies led by Radek Vondráček (ANO) challenged <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=127\">the use of</a> a state of legislative emergency to discuss <a href=\"http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2022-39\">an amendment to</a> the pandemic law (Law No. 39/2022 Coll.) at the beginning of 2022. In September 2022, the Constitutional Court rejected the proposal of the opposition deputies ( <a href=\"https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 1), but in its ruling it stated (p. 24) that <i>&quot;the process leading to the adoption of Law No. 39/2022 Coll. cannot be considered - at a sub-constitutional level - to be flawless&quot;</i> and noted in passing that <i>&quot;the legislative process under review and its course can be considered a reflection of the current political culture, the state of which is characterized, among other things, by numerous obstructionist negotiations, the chaotic agenda and course of meetings, as well as the inflexibility of the legislative process&quot;.</i></p><p> <strong>Final evaluation</strong></p><p> Marian Jurečka truthfully states that in the past, when rejecting proposals to repeal a law, the Constitutional Court used non-binding statements, so-called obiter dictums, in which it found, for example, doubts in the legislative process. For this reason, we assess the statement as true.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The statement by the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová, relates to the amendment to the Public Procurement Act <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABPJ9RLH6\">approved</a> by the government.</p><p> The Minister states that the main reason for submitting the amendment is the effort to speed up procedures and eliminate administrative burdens, which, according to her, is to be adjusted by changing the so-called negotiation procedure without publication. At the request of the government, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies decided that this <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=862\">proposal</a> will be discussed in a state of legislative emergency, which significantly limits the legislative process. The amendment is currently on the agenda of the meeting from May 26, 2020.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173714\">The explanatory memorandum</a> (.pdf, p. 3) of the amendment to the law states:</p><p> &quot; <i>The proposed amendment removes administrative obstacles to the award of contracts in negotiated procedures without publication so that negotiated procedures without publication based on Section 63, paragraphs 3 and 5 can be implemented in the shortest possible time.</i> &quot;</p><p> And he further comments on the need for adjustments due to the situation caused by the COVID-19 epidemic:</p><p> <i>&quot;It is necessary to ensure that the negotiated procedure, which is awarded in extremely urgent circumstances, is as administratively demanding as possible. Given the need to conclude the contract as quickly as possible, <strong>it is not appropriate to insist on actions to ensure the qualification of the supplier</strong> , convene an evaluation committee, or prevent the conclusion of the contract, as the public interest in the rapid performance of the public contract prevails here.&quot;</i></p><p> The key amendment is in Section 67, which regulates the procedure (ibid., p. 1). The following paragraph is added to the current wording:</p><p> <i><strong>&quot;(3) In the case of negotiated proceedings without publication pursuant to Section 63(3) and (5), Section 48(7) and (9), Section 73, Section 86 and Section 122 shall not apply.&quot;</strong></i></p><p> This point deserves further explanation, as it contains the changes that are to be made. According to paragraphs 3 and 5 <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p63\">of Section 63</a> , the following applies:</p><ul><li> <i>“The contracting authority may also use a negotiated procedure without publication if the public contract can only be performed by a particular supplier (…)”</i></li><li> <i>“The contracting authority may also use the negotiated procedure without publication if this is necessary as a result of extremely urgent circumstances which the contracting authority could not have foreseen and which it did not cause (…)”</i></li></ul><p> The proposed amendment to the law is therefore intended to allow certain requirements of the law not to be applied in cases of a negotiated procedure without publication, if there is not a large number of suppliers on the market or if there are urgent circumstances for this procedure. The key issue, however, is which requirements of the law will not have to be complied with in these cases.</p><p> As a result of the new Section 67, paragraph 3, access to contracts in the negotiated procedure without publication is simplified, for example, for companies that do not have book-entry shares (they do not have to have a clear ownership structure), which is regulated in the current version by <a href=\"\thttps://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p48-7\">Section 48, paragraphs 7</a> and <a href=\"\thttps://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p48-9\">9.</a> Companies do not have to submit documents on qualification pursuant to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p86\">Section 86</a> , and in the case of legal entities, the contracting authority does not have to ascertain information about its beneficial owner pursuant to <a href=\"\thttps://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p122-4\">Section 122, paragraph 4.</a> At the same time, one of the basic criteria for selecting a supplier pursuant to this Act is abolished - namely, the one that provides the most economically advantageous tender pursuant to <a href=\"\thttps://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134#p122-1\">Section 122, paragraph 1</a> .</p><p> It is therefore clear that these changes will significantly simplify the process of awarding public contracts through negotiated procedures without publication. However, Transparency International Czech Republic <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/vlada-ve-stavu-nouze-navrhuje-novelu-zakona-o-zadavani-verejnych-zakazek-ktera-otevira-dvere-miliardovym-skodam-a-ohrozuje-bezpecnost-cr/\">lists</a> a number of consequences that the adoption of the amendment may have. These include, for example, suspicious purchases and potential financial damage to the state caused by providing freedom in the negotiated procedure without publication. The Ministry of Regional Development, in turn, <a href=\"https://mmr.cz/cs/ostatni/web/novinky/mmr-novela-zakona-o-verejnych-zakazkach-zajisti-r\">argues for</a> the need to simplify the administratively overly complex procedure.</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because the justification of the amendment to the Public Procurement Act and its content clearly show the goal of simplifying and accelerating the award of public contracts in cases falling under tender procedures without publication. However, this fact does not call into question the criticism directed at the discussed amendment. The amendment to the Act may be perceived as potentially dangerous.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>The Ministry of the Interior also commented on the draft Building Act in its <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNBK2CPYTM\">analysis</a> (.pdf). In her statement, Minister Dostálová criticizes the estimates of the Ministry of the Interior, which estimated one-time costs at CZK 2.2—31.6 billion (p. 4). The part of securing space for new regional building offices and the <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/pripominky-k-stavebnimu-zakonu-muze-mmr-resit-do-konce-brezna/1838883\">planned</a> Supreme Building Office is mainly criticized.</p><p> The Ministry of the Interior states in the introduction to the section <em>on Premises</em> (p. 32) that the draft law “(...) <em>currently assumes an optimistic scenario where municipalities and regions will provide the state with their current premises. This expectation is unrealistic; the capacity of municipalities and regions will not be made available, as it would bring extraordinary problems in the area of IT, operation, sharing of services (e.g. the registry office) or working in a different regime (the Act on Civil Servants vs. the Civil Service Act). In the event of delimitation, it will be necessary to provide premises.</em> ”<em> </em>Estimates for securing premises by renting are around CZK 425 million per year. The Ministry further notes that “ <em>(...) it is not possible to solve the delimitation by renting everywhere, as no suitable premises are available at all in certain locations.</em> ”<em> </em>(p. 33)</p><p> The chapter dedicated to Construction (pp. 33—34) then states that &quot; <em>The maximalist variant assumes that new premises would be built for all existing officials of building authorities, integrated affected bodies and new service personnel. This includes 13,584 employees in total. Construction expenses would reach at least 25.4 billion crowns in the maximalist variant.</em> &quot;<em> </em>(p. 34). To these costs it would be necessary to add the costs of building archives for storing documentation. These costs are around CZK 3.5 billion. In total, the Ministry of the Interior estimates the construction in the most expensive possible version at CZK 28.9 billion.<br/><br/> Minister Dostálová falsely stated that &quot; <em>(...) the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior does not state that the state currently pays municipalities for the officials who handle construction procedures&quot;</em> . The chapter Financing the Agenda in the analysis deals with this entire issue.<em> </em>(p. 36), which details the current financing of the agenda of building authorities, spatial planning and partly also the affected authorities, which are currently financed through a contribution to the performance of state administration (pursuant to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-128#p62-1\">Section 62 of Act No. 128/2000 Coll., on municipalities</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-129#p29-2\">Section 29(2) of Act No. 129/2000 Coll., on regions</a> ).</p><p> The procedures for determining the amount of the contribution for the performance of state administration for 2020 are listed in <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2019-355#f6688621\">the annex to</a> Act No. 355/2019 on the State Budget of the Czech Republic for 2020. The individual contribution amounts for specific municipalities can also be clearly found on <a href=\"https://www.prispevekobce.cz/\">the website</a> of the Ministry of the Interior.</p><p> The Ministry of the Interior further <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/KORNBK2CPYTM\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 38) that the total real costs (including overheads) for the agenda of building authorities and land planning authorities at the municipal and regional levels amount to almost 4.6 billion CZK, of which 4.2 billion CZK are spent on municipalities. However, in reality, only 2.3 billion CZK is spent on the state budget through contributions to municipalities and regions. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the real overhead costs amount to 1.1 billion CZK.</p><p> Although the probability of constructing new buildings for all planned employees of new building authorities is unknown, we assess the statement as false, because the analysis of the Ministry of the Interior also addresses the issue of financing building authorities through contributions for the performance of state administration, the amount of which differs from those mentioned in Minister Dostálová&#39;s statement.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>The entire <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-prvni-audit-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_2104232054_tzr\">process</a> investigating Andrej Babiš&#39;s potential conflict of interest has been ongoing since 2018, when Transparency International <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-podava-prvni-podnet-tykajici-se-stretu-zajmu-andreje-babise/\">pointed out</a> the potential conflict of interest and also filed <a href=\"https://www.transparency.cz/transparency-international-podava-druhy-podnet-tykajici-se-stretu-zajmu-andreje-babise-a-evropskych-dotaci-pro-agrofert/\">a complaint</a> with the European Commission. The first preliminary audit report arrived in the Czech Republic in <a href=\"https://euractiv.cz/section/cr-v-evropske-unii/news/cesky-cerven-v-eu-traskave-audity-evropske-komise/\">June</a> 2019.</p><p> The audit investigation that preceded the report also <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropske-dotace-babis-agrofert-stret-zajmu-audit-kontroly-eu_1901111806_jgr\">affected</a> , among other things, the Ministry for Regional Development (MMR), or rather the National Coordination Body (NOK), whose <a href=\"https://kormoran.vlada.cz/usneseni/usneseni_webtest.nsf/web_file/uv130612.0448.doc/$File/uv130612.0448.doc\">role</a> (.doc, p. 1) <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/fondy-eu/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci\">is performed</a> by the MMR. At that time, officials were already in charge of the Czech side&#39;s response, so the minister should not have had any influence on it, at least not directly. However, she herself <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/ministerstvo-pro-mistni-rozvoj-audit-evropska-komise-stret-zajmu-premier-andrej-babis.A190827_142058_domaci_rko\">stated</a> : <i>&quot;Now we contradict every sentence on every page. We feel very hurt because a lot of things are not true.&quot;</i> We were unable to find in publicly available sources that Minister Dostálová met with EU auditors during the audit or at any time later, or that she was in direct contact with them regarding the report on Andrej Babiš&#39;s conflict of interest.</p><p> In the case of the response to the second audit report, which was delivered to the Czech Republic in <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-prvni-audit-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_2104232054_tzr\">December 2019</a> and was supposed to contain the final conclusions of the review and also mentioned a conflict of interest, it took longer to write the response. Minister Dostálová herself <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ministerstvo-poslalo-do-bruselu-odpoved-na-audit-k-babisove-stretu-zajmu-40325921\">stated</a> at the time that responses to audit reports are processed by officials. More precisely, she named officials of the National Coordination Body and also their <i>&quot;colleagues from the affected departments&quot;</i> . <i>&nbsp;</i> As we can learn from information on <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-stret-zajmu-praha-audit-evropska-komise-agrofert-dotace_1912051210_kno\">the iROZHLAS</a> server, this was mainly the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, whose competences include drawing subsidies from the aforementioned structural funds and the Cohesion Fund.</p><p> The Minister for Regional Development, especially shortly after the arrival of this second audit report, <a href=\"https://livestream.com/accounts/17590784/events/8915480/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=false&amp;defaultDrawer=&amp;autoPlay=false&amp;mute=false\">emphasized</a> (video, 0:48) that the documents are so-called <i>confidential</i> , i.e. in a confidential regime, and that <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/dostalova-komentuje-vysledky-auditu-k-babisovu-stretu-zajmu-40305726\">not</a> even ministers have access to them and that it is purely a matter for officials. She allegedly <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/dostalova-komentuje-vysledky-auditu-k-babisovu-stretu-zajmu-40305726\">did not read</a> the report herself and <i>is not &quot;interested&quot;</i> in it. However, she had also previously <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/klara-dostalova-evropska-komise-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_1912031101_miz\">added</a> : <i>&quot;We will definitely want to talk about some things face to face.&quot;</i></p><p> The only document currently published is the final audit <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cz_functioning_report/cz_functioning_report_en.pdf\">report</a> (.pdf) of the European Commission. For example, the report states that other entities audited (.pdf, pp. 1–2) are the Ministries of the Environment, Industry and Trade, and Labour and Social Affairs. In addition to the aforementioned ministries, agencies and funds were also <a href=\"https://demagog.cz/vyrok/20770\">audited</a> , such as the Agency for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic, the Agency for the Promotion and Entrepreneurship and Investment CzechInvest, the ESI Funds Council, the Common Strategic Framework Funds Council, the National Coordination Body, the Steering and Control Committee, and the City of Prague.</p><p> In response to this final report, the Minister <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/dostalova-andrej-babis-agrofert-audit-soud-eu-evropska-komise_2104262032_ban\">stated</a> that the Czech authorities <i>“hold the legal opinion, based on the arguments sent to the European Commission, that there was no breach of regulations”</i> . She also insisted on the existence of two legal interpretations, between which only a court can decide. The Ministry for Regional Development <a href=\"https://mmr.cz/cs/ostatni/web/novinky/vyjadreni-mmr-k-auditu-evropske-komise\">states</a> in its press release that the Czech authorities in their responses to the European Commission <i>“have repeatedly stated that the management and control systems have been set up in the Czech Republic in accordance with EU and national rules governing the issue of conflict of interest and that the Czech Republic maintains this position”</i> .</p><p> In conclusion, let us summarize that we were unable to find in publicly available sources whether Klára Dostálová interfered with the officials of the National Coordination Body in formulating their responses to the European Commission, or to what extent this was done. For this reason, we assess the statement as unverifiable.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>Minister Dostálová is talking about <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173718\">the government bill</a> (.pdf) amending Act <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2016-134/zneni-20191126\">No. 134/2016 Coll.</a> , on public procurement. This bill has been submitted to the Chamber of Deputies as Chamber of Deputies Paper <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=862\">No. 862.</a> By Government <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABPJ9RLH6\">Resolution No. 534</a> (.pdf) of Monday, May 11 (4 days before the interview), the Government requested that this bill be discussed in a shortened session, and the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Radek Vondráček, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173719&amp;pdf=1\">granted</a> the request (.pdf).</p><p> According to <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/docs/laws/1995/90.html#99\">Section 99</a> of the Act on the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies, an abbreviated session in a state of legislative emergency means omitting the first reading of the bill, the possibility of omitting the general debate, and the possibility of limiting the time of individual deputies at the rostrum in the plenary session. It also gives the Speaker of the Chamber the opportunity to order the Guarantee Committee a deadline by which the committee must submit a resolution on the given proposal.</p><p> This resolution was issued by the guarantee committee, i.e. the committee for public administration and regional development, at meeting <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173728&amp;pdf=1\">No. 39</a> (.pdf, invitation) on May 13, 2020 at 10:00. Here, it issued resolution <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=173897&amp;pdf=1\">No. 203</a> (.pdf) on the proposal, in which it proposes to the Chamber of Deputies to hold a general debate, conduct a detailed debate on all parts of the proposal and conclude the discussion on the proposal by 24:00 on the same day, i.e. Wednesday, May 13, 2020. At the same time, it recommends that the PS approve the proposal.</p><p> Before the start of the Chamber of Deputies&#39; session on May 13 (which <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/048schuz/s048001.htm\">began</a> at 3:00 p.m.), press conferences were held by the parliamentary groups. From <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=1509\">the regular order</a> of speeches by the individual parties in the press atrium and the recording <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/p...220411058330513\">of the Czech Television broadcast</a> from that day, we conclude that at the original time of its press conference (2:40 p.m.), the ANO parliamentary group was still deliberating.</p><p> At 12:30, Martin Kolovratník, a member of parliament for ANO, <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;t=862\">uploaded</a> his <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176886\">amendment (.docx) to the proposed amendment</a> to the parliamentary system. At 14:16, member of parliament Pekarová Adamová (TOP 09) uploaded her amendment <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176892\">No. 5248</a> (.docx) and at about the time of the press conference, i.e. at 14:43, 3 more amendments <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176896\">No. 5251</a> (.docx), <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176898\">No. 5252</a> (.docx) and <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176900\">No. 5253</a> (.docx) from member of parliament Profant (Pirates) were already uploaded to the system. As early as May 12, there was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=176872\">amendment No. 5225</a> (.docx) from member of parliament Jelínek (SPD). At the time when the ANO parliamentary group was in session, several amendments to the government amendment to the law had already been uploaded to the parliamentary system.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/ischuze.sqw?o=8&amp;s=48&amp;pozvanka=1\">Originally,</a> the agenda of this meeting was to discuss the aforementioned government proposal. Right at the beginning of the meeting, deputies Michálek, Pikal (Pirates), Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) and Okamura (SPD) spoke out against this point. <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/detail.sqw?id=6190\">Deputy Faltýnek</a> (chairman of the ANO parliamentary group) responded <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/048schuz/s048002.htm\">by announcing</a> that at the meeting of the parliamentary group, after which they did not have time to announce this decision to the media at a press conference, they agreed not to discuss this proposal in a state of legislative emergency (in an abbreviated meeting) and to postpone its regular discussion to the next meeting. At the proposal of deputy Michálek, this point was eliminated <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=72987\">by vote</a> no. 3 with the support of 101 out of 107 registered deputies (6 abstained). The next 49th meeting of the PS is scheduled for May 26, 2020, and the first reading of the proposal is tentatively <a href=\"https://www.psp.cz/sqw/ischuze.sqw?o=8&amp;s=49&amp;pozvanka=1\">scheduled</a> there as point no. 76.</p><p> The gradual recording of amendments could therefore have been one of the reasons why the ANO parliamentary group supported the discussion of the law in the standard procedure.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>In connection with formulating the response to the European Commission&#39;s preliminary audit, which announced the existence of a conflict of interest of Prime Minister Babiš, as well as its final version from December <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/evropska-komise-prvni-audit-stret-zajmu-andrej-babis_2104232054_tzr\">2019</a> , Minister <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/ministerstvo-poslalo-do-bruselu-odpoved-na-audit-k-babisove-stretu-zajmu-40325921\">Dostálová</a> always spoke about the document being processed by officials. Specifically, she mentions officials of the National Coordination Body (NOK), whose <a href=\"https://kormoran.vlada.cz/usneseni/usneseni_webtest.nsf/web_file/uv130612.0448.doc/$File/uv130612.0448.doc\">function</a> (.doc, p. 1) <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/fondy-eu/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci\">is performed</a> by the Ministry of Regional Development, and their &quot; <i>colleagues from the affected departments&quot;.</i></p><p> In this regard, <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-stret-zajmu-praha-audit-evropska-komise-agrofert-dotace_1912051210_kno\">the iRozhlas</a> server mentions part of the preliminary audit report from June 2019, which states that this concerns &quot; <i>the drawing of subsidies from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. This is money that is redistributed primarily by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.&quot;</i></p><p> However, in the final version of the audit report <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cz_functioning_report/cz_functioning_report_en.pdf\">published by</a> the European Commission (.pdf, pp. 1–2) in April this year, we can also read a list of institutions &quot; <i>involved in the process of managing and distributing subsidies&quot;</i> that were the subject of the audit, and which are therefore the above-mentioned &quot; <i>affected departments&quot;</i> . It is these institutions that communicated with the European Commission.</p><p> In addition to the supra-ministerial <a href=\"https://www.dotacni.info/tag/spolecny-strategicky-ramec/\">Council</a> for the Common Strategic Framework Funds, <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/evropske-fondy-v-cr/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci/pracovni-skupiny/rada-pro-fondy-ssr\">the Council</a> for the ESI Funds and the Steering and Coordination <a href=\"https://www.dotaceeu.cz/cs/evropske-fondy-v-cr/narodni-organ-pro-koordinaci/koordinace/ridici-a-koordinacni-vybor\">Committee,</a> there is the already mentioned National Coordination Body. Three ministries are also listed here: the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of the Environment. In addition to them, the report also lists the Agency for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic, the Agency for Entrepreneurship and Investment Support CzechInvest and the capital city of Prague.</p><p> In total, the audit report <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cz_functioning_report/cz_functioning_report_en.pdf\">lists</a> (.pdf, pp. 1–2) 7 &quot; <i>managing and intermediary institutions&quot;</i> , which include the ministries and agencies just mentioned, and 4 &quot; <i>horizontal institutions&quot;</i> , which include the National Coordination Body and other supra-departmental institutions.</p><p> Minister Dostálová is also right that these are not only ministries led by ministers from the ANO movement. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is led by <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/ministryne\">Jana Maláčová</a> from the ČSSD, and the Mayor of Prague is <a href=\"https://www.praha.eu/jnp/cz/o_meste/primator_a_volene_organy/Primator/vizitka_primatora_hmp/index.html\">Zdeněk Hřib</a> from the Pirate Party.</p><p><br></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
