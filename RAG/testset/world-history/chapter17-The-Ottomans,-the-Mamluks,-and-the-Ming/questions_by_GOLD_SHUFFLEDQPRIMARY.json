    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>One of the points of Babiš&#39;s pre-election <a href=\"https://www.anobudelip.cz/smlouva/\">Treaty with the citizens of the Czech Republic</a> was a sharp stance against migration quotas. It is also important to mention that no party in <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/cesko-dal-bojuje-proti-kvotam-na-uprchliky-navzdory-tomu-ze/r~dd56fd0a932411e7a0c50025900fea04/\">Czech politics</a> expressed support for the quotas set by the European Union for accepting migrants. Slovakia, Hungary and Romania also expressed their opposition to <a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/lidri-eu-dosahli-prelomove-dohody-v-migraci-kvoty-jsou-minulosti-167155/\">quotas</a> within the European Union. At the moment, <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/angela-merkelova-uprchlici-kvoty_1806101118_mos\">the tendency is changing</a> and, according to the proposal of the Visegrad countries, so-called flexible solidarity in migration policy could be adopted. Individual member states would then have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to accept refugees or whether their assistance would be financial.</p><p> Illegal migration, i.e. legal entry into our territory but exceeding the permitted period of stay, has had <a href=\"http://www.policie.cz/clanek/nelegalni-migrace-v-ceske-republice-za-rok-2017.aspx\">a downward trend in recent years</a> . However, these data are of a general nature and are in no way related to the refugee crisis, in which the Czech Republic was not and is not a destination country for refugees.</p><p> The truth remains that Andrej Babiš outlined priority points in his election campaign entitled Contract with the Citizens of the Czech Republic and defended himself against migration. However, this text cannot be considered the basis for changing migration policy within the European Union. There were many initiatives and pressures in the EU to change quotas and migration policy, and the Czech Republic was also critical of quotas. The biggest supporters of quotas were the countries that were most affected by the migration wave - Greece, <a href=\"https://zpravy.idnes.cz/minisummit-evropska-unie-migrace-brusel-angela-merkelova-pmy-/zahranicni.aspx?c=A180624_152203_zahranicni_mpl\">Italy</a> , Germany and <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/polsko-i-rakousko-jsou-proti-uprchlickym-kvotam/r~c21f628efc4c11e7ad1e0cc47ab5f122/\">Austria</a> . However, even within them, the quota policy is being abandoned.</p>\nSECTION B: <p>Prime Minister Andrej Babiš <a href=\"https://www.operationsophia.eu/the-prime-minister-of-the-czech-republic-visited-operation-sophias-headquarters/\">met</a> on 28 August 2018 with Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino, who commands the EUNAVFOR MED Operation <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cs/press/press-releases/2018/05/14/eunavfor-med-operation-sophia-operation-to-contribute-to-better-information-sharing-on-crime-in-the-mediterranean/\">Sophia</a> , but his explanation of international maritime law is inaccurate. International maritime law does not recognize the concept of accidental castaway, and under this maritime law, the captain of a ship flying the flag is obliged to provide assistance to any person found on the high seas who is in danger of death. This also applies to <a href=\"https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/co-delame/migrace-v-souvislostech/zachrana-ve-stredozemnim-mori-se-ridi-mezinarodnim-pravem-3521gp\">migrants</a> rescued in the Mediterranean.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.operationsophia.eu/about-us/\">EU NAVFOR MED Operation Sophia</a> is an EU naval operation established to disrupt the operational model of migrant smugglers and human traffickers in the southern central Mediterranean. Since the start of its active phase (October 2015), the operation has contributed to the arrest of 143 suspected smugglers and human traffickers and their transfer to the Italian authorities, and has neutralised 545 vessels. The operation has also contributed to saving the lives of 44,251 people. Its mandate ends on 31 December 2018.</p><p> The rules of conduct on the seas and oceans are an internationally valid norm, the definition of which is based on the international UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf\">UNCLOS</a> ) of 1982. Currently, this agreement has been signed by <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXI-6&amp;chapter=21&amp;Temp=mtdsg3&amp;clang=_en#1\">157</a> states and actors. Libya is one of the first signatories (1982), but the treaty has not yet been ratified. Italy signed the treaty in 1984 and approved it in 1995. For the sake of the image of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, it signed this agreement already in 1982, but without ratification. This took place only after the division of the republic. The Czech Republic <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#Czech%20Upon%20ratification\">adopted</a> the treaty in 1996 as part of the solution to access to the sea through neighboring Germany.</p><p> Therefore, when it comes to international maritime law, certain rights and obligations arise for the signatories. One of them is the obligation to provide assistance. This fact is described in Article 98 of the UNCLOS Treaty ( <a href=\"http://www.windsea.cz/public/Image/sekce-typ-117/umluva-osn-o-morskem-pravu.pdf\">pdf</a> ., p.25) as follows:</p><p> &quot; <em>Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, if he can do so without serious danger to the ship, its crew or passengers:</em></p><p> <em>(a) rendered assistance to any person found at sea in danger of life;</em></p><p> <em>(b) proceed with the greatest possible speed to the rescue of persons in danger, if he is informed that they need assistance and if such action could reasonably be expected;</em></p><p> <em>(c) after the collision, render assistance to the other ship, its crew and its passengers and, if possible, inform the other ship of the name of its own ship, its home port and the nearest port to which it is sailing.</em></p><p> <em>All coastal States shall facilitate the establishment, operation and maintenance of adequate and effective search and rescue services for the purpose of ensuring safety at and above the sea and, where circumstances so require, shall conclude regional agreements for mutual cooperation with neighbouring States for this purpose.”</em><br/><br/> The International Maritime Organization (IMO) further elaborates on the internationally recognized procedure for rescue at sea in its <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/personsrescued/Documents/Resolution%20A.920(22).pdf\">resolution</a> number A920 from 2001, where it grants the right to rescue to all in danger of life, regardless of their nationality, status and circumstances that led them to a threatening situation. It also determines that the rescuing ship or ships must transport the rescued to safety and treat the rescued in accordance with IMO rules and maritime traditions. The IOM describes general rules and guidelines <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/personsrescued/Pages/Default.aspx\">here</a> .</p><p> The issue of human trafficking is a highly complicated problem, the growing scope of which is also beginning to be perceived internationally, when, following the latest CNN report, the UN imposed <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/06/1011751\">sanctions</a> in June 2018 on several individuals suspected of participating in human trafficking in Libya and called for increased efforts to address this problem.</p><p></p><p></p>\nSECTION C: <p>The statement is assessed as true because both interested parties, according to their public statements, have indeed agreed on the aforementioned steps.</p><p> The result of another meeting, which was attended by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, among others, was a promise that none of the H-System clients would be evicted from Horoměřice until the case was resolved. Representatives of the Svatopluk association agreed with the bankruptcy administrator Josef Monsport that they would not apply <a href=\"http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/klienti-h-systemu-musi-podle-ns-vyklidit-byty-do-mesice-odmitaji-to/1645466\">the Supreme Court&#39;s decision</a> for the time being, according to which H-System clients were to move out of their homes in Horoměřice within thirty days.</p><p> The main success was the agreement to prepare a new expert opinion that will determine the value of the properties. According to the bankruptcy trustee, they are worth about 140 million, according to their residents, ten and a half million. Until the opinion is prepared and evaluated, no one will move. The creditors&#39; committee will decide on August 30 who will prepare the opinion. &quot; <em>Milestone number two will be an agreement on the method of assignment, milestone number three will be an evaluation on both sides,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said the cooperative&#39;s legal representative, Svatopluk</a> Lubomír Kincl. &quot; <em>The opinion should look for what the usual price of the properties is in 2018, but also what it was on several previous dates,</em> &quot; <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2551771-monsport-pocka-do-vyreseni-pripadu-klienti-h-systemu-zustanou-v-horomericich\">said Josef Monsport.</a></p><p> In 1993, the H-System company concluded contracts with hundreds of interested parties for the construction and transfer of apartments and houses. In the autumn of 1997, it went bankrupt, having completed only 34 family houses. Thousands of people lost about a billion after the collapse of H-System. The Svatopluk housing cooperative was founded by some of the damaged clients in October 1997 with the aim of continuing construction even at the cost of additional investments. The then bankruptcy administrator Karel Kudláček allowed them to do so under certain conditions. However, his successor Monsport later called on them to vacate the properties and enable the sale, with all the clients of the bankrupt company to be satisfied from the proceeds. The members of the cooperative have been in dispute with Monsport since 2000 so that they would not have to move out.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>The current situation in Libya is indeed quite problematic. The political factions seeking to govern are divided by both their divergent interests and their unwillingness to recognize the authority of any one of them.</p><p> This situation could be resolved by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/macron-hosts-libyan-factions-in-paris-in-push-to-secure-elections\">the elections scheduled</a> for December 10, 2018; according to the agreement, the parties should reach a decision on the regulations according to which these elections will take place by September 16, 2018.</p><p> However, since the May meeting of Libyan factions, there have been several changes in the influence of individual groups. <a href=\"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/why-libyan-elections-probably-wont-happen-year\">Confidence</a> in the formation of a stable government and the very promise of elections is not strengthened by previous unsuccessful attempts to establish a unified government and the fragmented political situation in the country.</p><p> Italy has also joined the talks between political groups in Libya. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-libya/italys-pm-conte-sees-no-rush-for-libyan-election-idUSKBN1KT1PH\">Giuseppe Conte said</a> he would organize a separate conference to stabilize Libya, with the support of Donald Trump, which could take place in November. Asked about the opinion of Emmanuel Macron, who led the previous agreement, he added that this agreement is in no way detrimental to any previous agreement made by other European countries.</p><p> As for the part of the statement regarding Operation <a href=\"https://www.operationsophia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Press-Kit.pdf\">Sophia</a> (.pdf), it is true that the Czech Republic is one of the 26 participating Member States. The main task of the operation is to cooperate with the Libyan Coast Guard and Navy in maintaining control over parts of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p> However, its effectiveness, according to data for the first half of 2018, is less than fifty percent. According to the Washington Post, the Libyan Coast Guard <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/fewer-migrants-are-making-it-to-europe-heres-why/2018/07/23/80b56082-8c57-11e8-9d59-dccc2c0cabcf_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.128395d0f156\">intercepted</a> only one in nine migrants crossing the Mediterranean in 2017.

He stated that the BIS and the National Center for Organized Crime (NCOZ) had last year uncovered and dismantled a spy network that was being built in the Czech Republic by the Russian intelligence service. The Russian Embassy denied this claim.</p><p> The BIS <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/vyrocni-zpravy/vyrocni-zprava-bezpecnostni-informacni-sluzby-za-rok-2017-d85907e6.html\">annual report</a> from 2017 also talks about Russian and Chinese influence. The report talks about two cyberattacks on <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/public/site/bis.cz/content/vyrocni-zpravy/2017-vz-cz.pdf\">the Foreign Ministry</a> (.pdf, pp. 15-16), about the &quot;infiltration&quot; of the Russian diplomatic mission by people with contacts in intelligence services (pp. 6-8), but also about disinformation websites (pp. 7-8).</p><p> A BIS spokesperson <a href=\"https://denikn.cz/minuta/221224/\">defended himself</a> against Miloš Zeman&#39;s statement of October 24, 2019, saying: <em>&quot;The fight against corruption is not within the legal competence of the BIS. This issue is addressed by special units of the Czech Police.&quot;</em></p><p> The status and scope of the BIS are determined by Act <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153\">No. 153/1994 Coll.</a> on the Intelligence Services of the Czech Republic. According to <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1994-153#p5-1-d\">Section 5,</a> the BIS provides information on activities whose consequences may threaten the security or significant economic interests of the Czech Republic. According to the official website of the BIS, a significant economic interest <a href=\"https://www.bis.cz/ekonomicke-zajmy-statu/\">is understood to be</a> an interest in the functionality of systems with a broad economic reach and in the optimal management of assets, the loss of which could threaten the basic functions of the state. <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1993ps/tisky/t101600.htm\">The explanatory memorandum</a> to the Act on Intelligence Services speaks of the need to &quot; <em>detect through intelligence efforts also efforts directed against the mechanisms of the financial and economic functioning of the state in cases where their consequences may damage the interests of the Czech Republic&quot;.</em> These economic interests may be influenced, among other things, by illegal activities, which can include corruption, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the law or on the BIS website.</p><p> It cannot be ruled out that a specific case of corruption that would significantly threaten the economic interests of the Czech Republic could fall within the scope of the BIS. However, in general, the fight against economic crime is not within the scope of the BIS. This is investigated by specialized units of the Czech Police, <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/uokfk-skpv-utvar-odhalovani-korupce-a-financni-kriminality-skpv.aspx\"></a> for example, the Corruption and Financial Crime Detection <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/uokfk-skpv-utvar-odhalovani-korupce-a-financni-kriminality-skpv.aspx\">Unit</a> or the Organized Crime Detection <a href=\"https://www.policie.cz/clanek/utvar-pro-odhalovani-organizovaneho-zlocinu-skpv-199737.aspx\">Unit</a> of the SKPV.</p>\nSECTION B: <p><a href=\"https://www.litcentrum.sk/autor/vojtech-mihalik/zivotopis-autora\">Vojtech Mihálik</a> was a Slovak poet and politician. In the years 1954–1959 he was the secretary of the Slovak Writers&#39; Association, and in the years 1965–1967 he was its chairman. He also worked as the editor-in-chief of the publishing house Slovenský spisovateľ. Since 1969 he has also held political and state positions, being the chairman of the Chamber of Nations in the Federal Assembly of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and also an advisor to the government. In the years 1966–1981 <a href=\"http://195.46.72.16/free/jsp/search/view/ViewerFoto.jsp?Document=..%2F..%2FFondyF%2F11%2F03%2F572524-1.1%40Foto&amp;QueryText=\">he was</a> a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS).</p><p> One of <a href=\"https://obetiokupace.dejepis21.cz/\">the victims</a> of the Warsaw Pact occupation was the Slovak student <a href=\"https://www.ustrcr.cz/uvod/srpen-1968/obeti-okupace/obeti-okupace-zapadni-slovensko/\">Dana Košanová</a> . On August 21, 1968, in the afternoon, she was <a href=\"http://okupace.evangnet.cz/kosanova-margita\">hit</a> by fire from Soviet soldiers on the steps of Comenius University in Bratislava. With a serious injury to her lumbar region, she was transported to the II. Surgical Department of the Faculty Hospital in Partyzánská Street in Bratislava, where she died the same day despite the care provided. Dana Košanová&#39;s name is listed on a memorial <a href=\"http://multimedia.ctk.cz/foto/document/2072179/2\">plaque</a> at the entrance to the Faculty of Law of Comenius University.</p><p> Vojtech Mihálik responded suggestively to the entry of Soviet troops and the tragic death of student Dana Košanová in his poem <em>Requiem</em> , <a href=\"https://is.muni.cz/th/m54go/DiseDise_240918.pdf\">published</a> (p. 163) on September 5, 1968 in a special edition of the weekly <em>Nové slovo.</em> With the help of the library staff of the Faculty of Social Sciences of Charles University, we managed to obtain the original text of the poem, from which President Zeman correctly quoted the part that deals with the murder of Dana Košanová.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>President Miloš Zeman, at a meeting with foreign ambassadors on October 27, 2019, did indeed begin <a href=\"https://www.hrad.cz/cs/prezident-cr/soucasny-prezident-cr/vybrane-projevy-a-rozhovory/projev-prezidenta-republiky-pri-setkani-se-cleny-diplomatickeho-sboru-15112\">his speech</a> with almost identical words: <em>&quot;Distinguished ambassadors, dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends of the Czech Republic, welcome to a successful country! Welcome to a country that has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, stable economic growth, and very low national debt.&quot;</em> He did not mention the declining national debt at the time.</p><p> We consider the opening words to be true in terms of content as well. The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is indeed the lowest in the European Union. According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics\">Eurostat data from October 2019</a> , it is 2.2%, while the average unemployment rate in the EU-28 is 6.3%.</p><p> If we measure economic growth by GDP, then the Czech Republic is truly in a period of growth. According to <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/92010940/chmu100119.xlsx/d8a25f9f-e671-4fd1-a1f7-0b090610fbbd?version=1.0\">Czech Statistical Office data</a> (.xlsx), GDP has been growing by at least 2.5% year-on-year since 2013.</p><p> President Miloš Zeman says that the state debt is relatively decreasing and low. It is true that in relative terms of state debt to GDP, the debt is indeed decreasing. As can be seen <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">in Eurostat data</a> , this trend has been evident since 2013, when the debt was at 44.9%. In 2018, the share of state debt to GDP was 32.6%. However, in absolute numbers, state debt is not clearly decreasing, on the contrary, it is rather fluctuating, which can be traced <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/rizeni-statniho-dluhu/dluhova-statistika/struktura-a-vyvoj-statniho-dluhu\">in the data of the Ministry of Finance</a> . According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en\">Eurostat data,</a> the debt of the Czech Republic is one of the lowest in the EU. The average share of state debt to GDP in the EU is 80.4%. Estonia and Bulgaria, for example, have lower relative state debt than the Czech Republic.</p><p> The average wage growth is reported <a href=\"https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/prace_a_mzdy_prace\">by the Czech Statistical Office</a> . In the 3rd quarter of 2019, the average wage reached CZK 33,697 (increased by 6.9% year-on-year).</p><p> The growth of old-age pensions can be monitored, for example, <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/verejny-sektor/statni-rozpocet/hospodareni-systemu-duchodoveho-pojisten\">on data from the Ministry of Finance</a> . In 2016, the average old-age pension was CZK 11,460, in 2017 it was CZK 11,850, and in 2018 the average old-age pension reached CZK 12,418.</p>\nSECTION D: <p>To evaluate this statement, we will use only a quote from the Constitution of the Czech Republic. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl68\">Article 68</a> , which states:</p><p> <i>“(1) The Government is responsible to the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> <i>(2) The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President of the Republic and, upon his proposal, shall appoint the other members of the Government and entrust them with the management of ministries or other offices.</i></p><p> <i>(3) The Government shall appear before the Chamber of Deputies within thirty days of its appointment and request a vote of confidence.</i></p><p> <i>(4) If the newly appointed government does not gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the procedure shall be as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. If the government thus appointed also fails to gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Republic shall appoint the Prime Minister on the proposal of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</i></p><p> It is precisely the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned article in the Constitution that describes that in the event of a vote of no confidence being cast on the first attempt, the same procedure is followed again. However, if a vote of no confidence is cast on the second attempt, a third attempt follows, during which the power to select the Prime Minister lies with the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.</p><p> Let us add that this constitutional procedure gives the President of the Republic considerable room for discretion. In particular, the Constitution does not dictate to the President who should be appointed Prime Minister in each attempt to form a government. As a rule, this is the chairman of the party that won the election, but as Miloš Zeman mentions in a verified interview, the coalition potential of individual parliamentary parties also plays a role. Let us recall the parliamentary elections in 2010, when the ČSSD won, but President Klaus instead of Bohuslav Sobotka <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sanci-vyjednat-vladu-ma-necas-sobotku-klaus-zklamal/r~i:article:670008/\">entrusted</a> the formation of the government to the chairman of <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2010/ps2?xjazyk=CZ\">the second</a> ODS, Petr Nečas, whom he subsequently <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/klaus-jmenoval-necase-premierem-45608\">appointed</a> Prime Minister.</p><p> A similar case occurred in 2013 after the fall of the Nečas government, when the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Miroslava Němcová had 101 parliamentary signatures in support of a possible new government, but President Zeman instead <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1090181-vladu-sestavi-ekonom-rusnok-rozhodl-zeman\">tasked</a> Jiří Rusnok with forming a caretaker government and subsequently <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/-vladu-odborniku-povede-rusnok-prezident-zeman-ho-jmenoval-premierem_201306251920_mskalicky\">appointed</a> him prime minister.</p><p> Even in the second attempt to appoint a prime minister who will form a government with confidence, there is no stipulation as to who should be appointed, especially that it should be the “second in line.” In 2018, for example, President Zeman <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/premier-andrej-babis-prezident-milos-zeman-podruhe_1806061400_ako\">appointed</a> Andrej Babiš as prime minister even after his government failed to win confidence in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>\nSECTION E: <p>The ruling <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-za-novu-do-konce-dubna.A030318_144623_domaci_has\">refers</a> to property disputes from 1999 to 2003 between TV Nova CEO Vladimír Železný (or CET 21, the broadcasting license <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/zelezny-prejmenuje-cet-21-na-tv-nova.A_990419_170757_domaci_jpl\">holder</a> ) and American investors (CME). CME claims that its investments in TV Nova were <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/cesko-musi-cme-zaplatit-10-miliard-korun_200303151837_mtaborska\">damaged</a> by Vladimír Železný&#39;s attempt to cut off foreign investors.</p><p> CEO Železný was <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/cesko-zaplati-kvuli-nove-miliardy.A030314_200747_domaci_jpl\">supported</a> in his attempt to spin off TV Nova from CME in 1999 by the Radio and Television Broadcasting Council, which is vaguely referred to in the ruling. These circumstances resulted in arbitration proceedings (or arbitral proceedings) that ended against the Czech Republic, which had <a href=\"https://www.mfcr.cz/assets/cs/media/Dohoda_DPOI-USA-cesky.pdf\">an obligation</a> (.pdf) to protect American foreign investments. The victorious company CME <a href=\"https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/rozhodnuto-cesko-za-arbitraz-zaplatilo.A030515_095759_domaci_has\">received</a> over 10 billion crowns from the state in the arbitration dispute.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>General Motors is an American multinational corporation that is one of the world&#39;s largest car manufacturers. However, it ran into major problems, among other things due to the effects of the global economic crisis of 2008. GM has had enough of its own problems over the past decade, such as a constantly declining market share, with the price per share gradually <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/05/31/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy_looms/index.htm?postversion=2009053112\">falling</a> to almost 75 cents. </p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/chart_gm_shrinking.03.gif\"><figcaption> Source: <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2009/06/01/news/companies/gm_bankruptcy/\">CNN</a></figcaption></figure><p> But the Great Recession also meant that car sales dropped significantly. All of these factors led GM to declare <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/ceska-ekonomika/obri-bankrot-automobilky-je-tu-gm-chce-ochranu/r~i:article:638814/?redirected=1532723355\">bankruptcy</a> on June 1, 2009. On the same day, the company filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. The administration of then-President Barack Obama bailed out GM with a nearly $50 billion <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">injection</a> of cash, for which it acquired a 60.8% stake in the company. Canada also <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/1405425-automobilka-general-motors-zbankrotovala\">bought</a> part of the company, and the United Auto Workers union bought another part. The United States then gradually sold off this stake, for which it collected $39 billion. The last part of its stake <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/12/09/government-treasury-gm-general-motors-tarp-bailout-exit-sale/3925515/\">was sold by</a> the United States in December 2013.</p><p> General Motors remained in bankruptcy for only 39 days and soon returned to the stock market thanks to reorganization. As part of the restructuring, the company <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/automobilka-gm-se-z-bankrotu-v-roce-2009-zotavila-vyrabi-osm-milionu-vozu-rocne-1359402\">stopped</a> production of some unprofitable brands such as Hummer, Pontiac and Saturn. The company also closed some of its factories and focused on a narrower selection of brands - such as Chevrolet and Cadillac. The US entry into car manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler ultimately saved 1.5 million jobs. It is estimated that the US <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-bailout-study-idUSL1N0JO0XU20131209\">saved</a> $ 105 billion in collecting social security payments and social benefits for people who would have lost their jobs due to the bankruptcy.</p><p> The Czech Republic can help Czech companies in this way. <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66746670-vlada-hodla-vstoupit-do-vyznamnych-soukromych-firem\">According to</a> Deputy Prime Minister Karel Havlíček, this would be a similar model to that outlined by Miloš Zeman using the example of the USA and General Motors. &quot; <i>We call it the American model, it is not socialization, as we are now being criticized a lot.&quot;</i> Many states are trying to save their strategic companies in this way, as are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesasquith/2020/04/01/could-airlines-be-nationalised-as-italy-takes-full-ownership-of-alitalia-will-more-airlines-follow/#59f3640877df\">airlines</a> .</p><p> Finance Minister Alena Schillerová and the government of Andrej Babiš have <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66751220-schillerova-chce-zestatnovat\">proposed</a> that shares in some Czech companies, such as CSA, should be bought back and then <a href=\"https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66749800-deficit-200-miliard-i-pristi-rok\">sold</a> again, following the American model. Czech Airlines <a href=\"https://www.lidovky.cz/byznys/doprava/zachrana-csa-verdikt-zrejme-padne-do-dvou-tydnu.A200416_130657_ln-doprava_ele\">is</a> currently 98 percent owned by Smartwings, 49 percent of which is owned by the Chinese state-owned company CITIC. However, this proposal is criticized by many economists and experts who do not consider CSA to be a strategic enterprise, and <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/koronahelpdesk-e15/v-cesku-zadna-strategicka-firma-ke-znarodneni-neni-shoduje-se-opozice-s-analytiky-1368824\">the opposition</a> is also opposed. Petr Bartoň, the chief economist of the Natland group, compared the situation between CSA and GM for <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/clanek/znarodneni-csa-nic-neresi-rika-ekonom-40321128\">Novinky.cz</a> : &quot; <i>The management is not in a state of catastrophic failure and it is not an irreplaceable critical infrastructure. CSA was only prohibited from offering its services. There would be demand, but citizens are prohibited from traveling anywhere. This can be solved with existing programs to maintain economic relations for the rest of the economy. That is, if those programs were sufficient.&quot;</i></p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

I assume that there were 14 applicants for the position, some kind of selection procedure took place here.

This (passenger transport, note Demagog.cz) was the only item where we did not do it (we did not vote for a VAT reduction, note Demagog.cz), because transport companies would make money from it without it being reflected in reduced fares for people.\nSECTION C: ...and I discussed it with him (Wolfgang Schäuble - note: Demagogue) and he always understood us, he saw it at the press conference and said yes, here is the Czech Republic, and the V4 have a different history, they don&#39;t have the multicultural model and we don&#39;t want it, because the foreigners haven&#39;t been integrated in the individual states. \nSECTION D: Look at how we are increasing pensions.
