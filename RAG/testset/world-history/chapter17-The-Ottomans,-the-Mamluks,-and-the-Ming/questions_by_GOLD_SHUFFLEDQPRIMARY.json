    "Determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the content and a number of short explanations with additional information. Only one of the following explanations is relevant:\nSECTION A: <p>The European Commission&#39;s preliminary conclusions on the network sharing agreement in the Czech Republic between O2 CZ/CETIN and T-Mobile CZ can be found in the European Commission&#39;s press <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/ip_19_5110\">release</a> from August 2019.</p><p> The report states that network sharing is &quot; <em>a common practice that can reduce costs and facilitate the development of electronic communications networks. In most cases it leads to greater efficiency. However, in certain circumstances it can have negative effects on competition</em> .&quot;</p><p> According to the same source, Commissioner Margrethe Vestager commented on the situation in the Czech Republic as follows:</p><p> <em>“Network sharing by operators is generally beneficial to consumers, as it leads to faster network development, cost savings and coverage of rural areas. However, if there are indications that cooperation agreements may harm consumers, it is our duty to investigate them and ensure that there is real competition in the market. In this case, we are concerned that a network sharing agreement between the two largest operators in the Czech Republic is restricting competition in more densely populated parts of the country.”</em></p><p> The Commission identified two aspects as specific variables occurring on the Czech market:</p><ul><li> high concentration of the Czech market with only three mobile operators</li><li> The operators O2 and T-Mobile, which are affected by the sharing, control three quarters of the market</li></ul><p> The press release concludes with the following:</p><p> <em>&quot;The Commission therefore preliminarily concludes that the network sharing agreement between the two main Czech mobile operators</em> <em><strong>restricts competition, thereby hindering innovation</strong></em> <em>, and thus infringes EU antitrust rules. The Commission is of the opinion that in this specific case the agreement does not lead to greater efficiency and quality of services, but rather likely to lead to a lack</em> <strong><em>of incentives for the operators concerned to improve their networks and services for the benefit of users</em></strong> .&quot;</p><p> We assess the statement as true, because in his statement the Minister fulfilled the essence of the wording of the European Commission&#39;s press release. It is necessary to note that the Minister is not entirely precise (the use of the word &quot;eliminate&quot;). However, <a href=\"http://synonymus.cz/doslova/\">we will not</a> take the final part of the Minister&#39;s statement as an attempt at an exact quotation, because the expression &quot;literally and literally&quot; can have different meanings (for example, &quot;word by word&quot;, but also &quot;really&quot;).</p>\nSECTION B: <p>The national energy mix <a href=\"https://www.ote-cr.cz/cs/statistika/narodni-energeticky-mix\">represents</a> the share of energy sources in a country. It is an overview of the use of energy from individual <a href=\"https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/about-energy-mix\">primary sources</a> such as fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, oil), nuclear sources and renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and others).</p><p> The resulting energy mix <a href=\"https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/about-energy-mix\">varies</a> from region to region and country. It depends on the given natural, economic and social conditions. Historical, geopolitical, environmental and other factors also play a role.</p><p> The Czech Republic&#39;s energy policy is based on <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/dokumenty/52841/60959/636207/priloha006.pdf\">the State Energy Concept of the Czech Republic</a> (.pdf). This represents a long-term national strategy that is set &quot; <em>in accordance with the long-term energy strategy of the European Union focused on decarbonization, high security of supply and competitive energy prices</em> &quot; ( <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/dokumenty/52841/60959/636207/priloha006.pdf\">.pdf</a> , p. 5).</p><p> European Union legislation in the field <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/cs/sheet/68/energy-policy-general-principles\">of energy</a> focuses mainly on issues of the common market and the environment.</p><p> Energy is covered by Title XXI of Part Three <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT\">of the Treaty</a> on the Functioning of the European Union. Article 194(1) of the Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">sets out</a> (.pdf, p. 134) the objectives of EU policy and its scope in the field of energy: &quot; <em>To ensure the functioning of the energy market; to ensure the security of energy supply in the Union; to promote energy efficiency and energy saving as well as the development of new and renewable energy sources; and to promote the interconnection of energy networks.</em> &quot;</p><p> Paragraph 2 of Article 194 <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">declares</a> (.pdf, p. 135) the independence of Member States in the formulation of their own energy policies. The article states that legislation and measures to achieve the objectives of paragraph 1 shall not affect &quot; <em>the right of a Member State to determine the conditions for the exploitation of its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the fundamental composition of its energy supply.</em> &quot;</p><p> There are therefore standards and regulations that influence the energy policy of individual EU member states, but the composition of the energy mix is the responsibility of the states.</p><p> One of the measures concerning the EU internal market and also affecting the energy sector is illegal aid. This is defined in Article 107 of <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT\">the Treaty</a> on the Functioning of the European Union: &quot; <em>Any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market, save as otherwise provided in the Treaties</em> &quot; ( <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">.pdf</a> , p. 91).</p><p> The Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 92) that the Commission monitors the compatibility of state aid with the internal market and may, where appropriate, order the state to abolish or adjust unlawful aid (Article 108(2)).</p><p> Furthermore, the Treaty <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=CS\">states</a> (.pdf, p. 92) that “ <em>the Commission must be informed in sufficient time of any plans to grant or alter aid in order to enable it to submit its observations. If it considers that such a plan is not compatible with the internal market having regard to Article 107, it shall immediately initiate the procedure referred to in paragraph 2. The Member State concerned shall not put the envisaged measures into effect until the Commission has taken a final decision on the procedure</em> ” (Article 108(3)).</p><p> Another example of legislative criteria are environmental commitments. In 2015, the European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_15_4485\">presented</a> the so-called Energy Union, which aims to ensure a secure, sustainable, affordable and competitive energy system in the EU. There are a number of EU strategies and targets in the field of climate and energy (e.g. Energy Strategy <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2030-energy-strategy\">2030</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2050-energy-strategy\">2050</a> ).</p><p> One of the EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2030-energy-strategy\">requirements</a> is to introduce a 32% share of renewable energy sources by 2030. This and other requirements are implemented by the National Energy and Climate <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/2019/11/Vnitrostani-plan-CR-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu.docx\">Plan</a> of the Czech Republic (.docx). This climate and energy <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/2019/11/Vnitrostani-plan-CR-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu.docx\">plan</a> (.docx, pp. 26–27) states that “ <em>The Czech Republic plans to achieve a share of renewable energy sources in gross final consumption of 22% by 2030, which is an increase of 9 percentage points compared to the national target of 13% for 2020. The stated share of 22% corresponds to the requirement to express a national contribution to achieving the binding EU target of 32% by 2030 according to Article 3 of the revised version</em> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0028\"><em>of Directive 2009/28/EC</em></a> <em>on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (</em> <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018L2001\"><em>Directive 2018/2001</em></a> <em>).</em> “</p><p> The National Climate and Energy <a href=\"https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/2019/11/Vnitrostani-plan-CR-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu.docx\">Plan</a> (.docx, p. 1) corresponds to the priorities of the European Commission, which presented them on November 30, 2016 as part of the &quot;Clean Energy for All Europeans&quot; <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/IP_16_4009\">package</a> .</p><p> The EU&#39;s nuclear policy is based on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/CS/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012A/TXT\">the Treaty</a> establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. EU countries <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/nuclear-energy/overview\">decide</a> for themselves whether to include nuclear energy in their energy mixes.</p>\nSECTION C: <p>In his statement, Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlíček gives an illustrative example of the increasing costs of completing the Mochovce nuclear power plant in Slovakia.</p><p> Construction of the Slovak Mochovce nuclear power plant began in 1981. The two originally planned units with a total output of 880 MW were <a href=\"https://www.skoda-js.cz/reference/jaderna-elektrarna-mochovce-2/\">completed</a> and commissioned in 1998 and 2000, respectively, while the construction of units 3 and 4, which Minister Havlíček is talking about, was <a href=\"http://www.seas.sk/data/file/87/sz-eia-mo34-sk.pdf\">suspended</a> in 1992 (.pdf, pp. 1–3) and <a href=\"http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf\">preserved</a> for a long time (.pdf, p. 11).<br/><br/> The actual construction work <a href=\"http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf\">began</a> (.pdf, p. 12) in 2008 with a planned completion date of 2013 or 2014, but there have been several delays and the construction has become more expensive, for example due to <a href=\"https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/slovensky-urad-zjistil-nedostatky-v-budovane-jaderne-elektrarne-1362287\">the introduction of</a> new safety features. According to the current plan, the power plant should be <a href=\"https://cz.seas.sk/jaderna-elektrarna-mochovce\">completed</a> in 2020. However, developments <a href=\"https://oenergetice.cz/rychle-zpravy/dokonceni-slovenske-jaderne-elektrarny-mochovce-se-prodrazi-a-opet-opozdi/\">indicate</a> that completion or start of operation on schedule may not happen again.</p><p> The construction of units 3 and 4 was stopped at a relatively advanced stage. At the time of the construction of the building, approximately 70% of the construction work had already <a href=\"http://www.allforpower.cz/UserFiles/files/2011/modrany_mochovce.pdf\">been completed</a> (.pdf, p. 11) and approximately 30% of the equipment had been delivered. If Minister Havlíček is talking about this basis for the construction of the nuclear power plant worth 1 to 2 billion euros, then we have not been able to verify this amount. However, given the scope of the work carried out, it is likely that the amounts involved are in the order of billions of euros, as Havlíček correctly states.</p><p> If we now take a closer look at the financing of the completion of the Mochovce power plant, the latest reported cost increase <a href=\"https://oenergetice.cz/rychle-zpravy/dokonceni-slovenske-jaderne-elektrarny-mochovce-se-prodrazi-a-opet-opozdi/\">is</a> 5.67 billion euros, which is 144.6 billion crowns at <a href=\"https://www.kurzy.cz/kurzy-men/nejlepsi-kurzy/EUR-euro/\">the exchange rate</a> of 25 November 2019. For example, in 2014, the estimated costs <a href=\"https://www.seas.sk/clanok/akcionari-schvalili-rozpocet-na-dokoncenie-mochoviec/138\">were</a> 4.6 billion euros, which would be 117.3 billion crowns at today&#39;s exchange rate. If the price of the power plant was set at 7 billion euros, the price of the power plant would be 178.5 billion crowns at today&#39;s exchange rate. Similar prices are not <a href=\"https://oenergetice.cz/jaderne-elektrarny/jake-jsou-ceny-za-jaderne-reaktory-iii-generace/\">unusual</a> .</p><p> Let us add that <a href=\"https://www.seas.sk/mochovce-3-4-npp\">the output</a> of the parts of the nuclear power plant being built should be 2 x 471 MWe, a total close to the 1000 MW stated by Havlíček.</p><p></p>\nSECTION D: <p>Minister Havlíček <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/internet-a-pc/mobil/clanek/ctvrty-operator-v-cesku-ministerstvo-zvazuje-posunuti-aukce-5g-siti-40306971\">opposed</a> the proposed terms of the frequency auction prepared by the Czech Telecommunications Office. He defended his words by saying that the proposed method would not attract a sufficient number of interested parties.</p><p> The situation escalated at the end of January 2020. On January 27, the then Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Office, Jaromír Novák, submitted his resignation effective January 1. The Ministry of Industry and Trade managed <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABLBBAHHQ\">to dismiss</a> Novák on January 27. Jaromír Novák justified his resignation by saying that the new proposed auction conditions would not lead to an improvement in the competitive environment, would jeopardize the rapid deployment of 5G networks, and would lead to a number of lawsuits.</p><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"cs\" dir=\"ltr\"> I summarized the reasons for my resignation in a letter. <a href=\"https://t.co/dSK8o623vq\">pic.twitter.com/dSK8o623vq</a></p> — Jaromir Novak (@xmireknovak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xmireknovak/status/1221716597624184833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2020</a> </blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p> Jaromír Novák also said that the final moment when he decided to resign came when the government was allegedly discussing a new auction proposal, but he <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/internet-a-pc/mobil/clanek/odvolany-predseda-rady-ctu-jaromir-novak-prichod-ctvrteho-operatora-je-ohrozen-40311903\">was not</a> invited to the meeting.</p><p> Before his resignation, Jaromír Novák positively <a href=\"https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/kmitocty-jaromira-novaka-od-aukce-pres-velkoobchodni-nabidky-az-k-zakonu/\">assessed</a> the prepared conditions of the auction: <em>&quot;We prepared the auction with the utmost responsibility and care, and we believe it has the potential to meet the goals that the government was informed about last year, namely in particular strengthening competition through the entry of a nationwide fourth infrastructure operator and starting the development of 5G networks. We can also see this in the market responses, where there is a real interest from new players in participating in the auction, as well as the concerns of existing operators about new competition that would stimulate competition in the household segment and ensure better conditions for customers nationwide.&quot;</em> Even after leaving office, the former chairman <a href=\"https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/predseda-rady-ctu-jaromir-novak-rezignoval-kvuli-tlaku-ministra-na-aukci-5g-kmitoctu/\">defended</a> the course of preparation and the result itself in the form of the auction rules.</p><p> As for the CTU <a href=\"https://www.ctu.cz/rada-ctu\">Council</a> , we found only one mention of the original CTU proposal. And that was by the current chairwoman Hana Tóvárková, who was <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/operator-mobilni-operatori-v-cr-cesko-hana-tovarkova-ctu-cesky-telekomunikacni_2001291830_ako\">appointed</a> to replace Jaromír Novák. On November 12, 2019, the then member of the CTU Council Tóvárková <a href=\"https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/aukce-5g-kmitoctu-je-do-velke-miry-politicka-zalezitost-rika-nova-radni-ctu-hana-tovarkova/\">said</a> that the proposal could be subject to changes, but she also supported the then chairwoman Novák in saying that the auction must take place as quickly as possible.</p><p> We did not find any public statements from other members of the CTU Council, specifically Jiří Peterka, Josef Chomyn and Lukáš Zelený, regarding the auction or the upcoming changes. However, we do not know whether they opposed the conditions prepared by the CTU in closed negotiations with the Ministry of Industry and Trade or elsewhere. Therefore, we assess the statement as unverifiable.</p>\nSECTION E: <p><a href=\"https://www.nukib.cz/cs/o-nukib/\">NÚKIB</a> is the central administrative authority for cybersecurity, including the protection of classified information in the field of information and communication systems and cryptographic protection. The abbreviation NÚKIB stands for National Office for Cyber and Information Security.</p><p> On December 17, 2018, the agency issued <a href=\"https://www.nukib.cz/cs/uredni-deska/\">a warning</a> against the use of software and hardware from Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. The agency&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.nukib.cz/download/uredni-deska/Varov%C3%A1n%C3%AD%20N%C3%9AKIB%202018-122-17.pdf\">report</a> (.pdf, p. 1) states, among other things, that &quot; <em>the use of technical or program resources from the above-mentioned companies poses a threat to cybersecurity</em> .&quot; The agency justifies its position, among other things, by saying that Chinese laws and the political environment &quot; <em>require private companies to cooperate in pursuing the interests of the PRC, including participation in intelligence activities&quot;</em> (p. 1).<br/><br/> State agencies and private companies that manage critical information infrastructure or important information systems <a href=\"https://www.itbiz.cz/zpravicky/huawei-vyvoj-kauzy\">are required</a> by law to conduct a security audit based on a warning from the National Cybersecurity Office. The institutions <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/huawei-kauza-vyrobky-cinska-firma-varovani-nukib-analyza-audit-riziko_1901250600_kno\">are not required</a> to publish their analysis or submit it to the government. By law, only the Cybersecurity Office can review the audits.</p><p> Analyses of critical systems falling under the Cybersecurity Act were already <a href=\"https://www.nukib.cz/cs/informacni-servis/aktuality/1349-ministerstva-urady-i-firmy-provedly-predepsane-analyzy-prijimaji-opatreni-ke-snizeni-rizika/\">completed</a> in the first half of this year. Other systems have also undergone analysis; for example, the Ministry of the Interior planned <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/varovani-nukib-huawei-bezpecnostni-hrozba-ministerstva_1903260600_tec\">to complete</a> the analyses of all systems only by the end of the third quarter of 2019. However, this was due to the large number of systems that the ministry manages. On the contrary, the Ministries of Health and Labor and Social Affairs, for example, completed audits of all their systems in the spring of 2019.</p><p> We therefore assess the statement as false, because even though we cannot rule out that some audit is actually underway, most of them, especially audits of critical infrastructure, have already been completed.</p>\nSECTION F: <p>The Minister of Industry and Trade, Karel Havlíček, has indeed announced to the media his intentions to postpone the frequency auction in which the fourth operator is to be selected. The first mentions appeared in <a href=\"https://www.respekt.cz/spolecnost/ministr-premysli-ze-odlozi-aukci-na-ctvrteho-operatora\">October</a> 2019. At that time, the start of the auction was <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/ctu-presunul-zahajeni-aukce-mobilnich-kmitoctu-na-leden/1810374\">postponed</a> to the beginning of January 2020. According to the media, the reason was Vodafone&#39;s complaint to the European Commission about network sharing by CETIN and T-Mobile, or rather the Commission&#39;s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/cs/ip_19_5110\">communication</a> , which implies a possible restriction of competition.</p><p> Talk of a further shift began again in <a href=\"https://www.novinky.cz/internet-a-pc/mobil/clanek/ctvrty-operator-v-cesku-ministerstvo-zvazuje-posunuti-aukce-5g-siti-40306971\">December</a> 2019. Minister Havlíček argued that the current auction conditions would not attract a sufficient number of bidders.</p><p> A fundamental change was brought about by the resignation, or rather the dismissal, of the head of the Czech Telecommunications Office, Jaromír Novák. He submitted his resignation on January 31, 2020. The government <a href=\"https://apps.odok.cz/attachment/-/down/RCIABLBBAHHQ\">managed</a> to dismiss him that day. Jaromír Novák <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xmireknovak/status/1221716597624184833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1221716597624184833&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lupa.cz%2Fclanky%2Fpredseda-rady-ctu-jaromir-novak-rezignoval-kvuli-tlaku-ministra-na-aukci-5g-kmitoctu%2F\">justified</a> his resignation by saying that he was dissatisfied with the development of the auction conditions.</p><p> As for the argument about security risks, we were unable to find any statements or reports in connection with the Ministry of Industry and Trade mentioning a potential security risk. The only mentions of the security issue were made after Jaromír Novák was dismissed. In an article for <a href=\"https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/proc-verim-ve-ctvrteho-operatora/\">the Lupa.cz</a> server, Novák stated that he had asked the Prime Minister to check the economic ties between potential participants in the auction and the resulting security risks. He said that he had not encountered any problems that would lead to the exclusion of any participant from the auction. In an interview for <a href=\"https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66713970-zlevneni-prinese-jen-silny-ctvrty-operator-inspirace-slovenskem-nicemu-nepomuze-rika-odvolany-sef-ctu-novak\">Hospodářské noviny</a> , he also stated that he had not received any information from the security services last autumn.</p><p> We cannot therefore decide whether the Ministry of Industry and Trade or Minister Havlíček personally warned anyone about the security risks of potentially setting the auction in favor of one participant. However, no one from the Ministry of Industry and Trade spoke publicly about such a risk.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",

However, as <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/zakaz-koalic-s-komunisty-ods-nepomohl-mesta-ho-porusuji/r~4464b4d4560511e49bec0025900fea04/?redirected=1533021181\">the Aktuálně.cz</a> server found out, the cell there eventually reached an agreement with the party leadership and kept its license. This was despite the fact that the ODS members in Rychnov continued to form a coalition with the KSČM. For example, in Týnec nad Sázavou, the party cell was actually dissolved and the representatives continued to exercise their mandate as independents. At the same time, there are known cases where ODS members who entered a coalition with the communists at the local level announced their withdrawal from the ODS and decided to continue in the coalition as independents. This happened, for example, in <a href=\"https://vary.idnes.cz/starostove-kterym-zrusili-sdruzeni-chteji-opustit-ods-p2j-/vary-zpravy.aspx?c=A110301_095926_vary-zpravy_sou\">Aš and Březová</a> .</p><p> The ODS Executive Board dealt with the revocation of licenses from local cells due to coalition cooperation with the KSČM, for example, in 2007, when, according to the <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/vykonna-rada-ods-resi-spolupraci-strany-s-komunisty-na-komunalni-urovni_200703312105_mmatusu\">iRozhlas.cz</a> server, two licenses were revoked in the Olomouc region. Thus, licenses are revoked from party cells in the event of non-compliance with the resolution from the 17th Congress prohibiting cooperation with the KSČM, although in some cases the license was ultimately not revoked.</p><p></p>\nSECTION B: <p>At the outset, it should be clarified that Chairman Fiala is talking about <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236\">Act</a> No. 236/1995 Coll. (abbreviated as the salary of constitutional officials). The so-called <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236#p3-3\">automaton</a> , or linking the salary of constitutional officials to the state of the economy, is reflected in the determination of a certain <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-236#p8-1\">coefficient</a> by which the so-called salary base is multiplied. This is 2.75 times the &quot; <em>average nominal monthly salary of natural persons in the non-business sphere achieved according to published data from the Czech Statistical Office for the calendar year before last</em> &quot; <em>.</em> In other words, for 2019, the salary base is calculated as 2.75 times the average monthly salary for 2017 and determined by the communication of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.</p><p> The above-described machine itself was already part of <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2002-309#cast33\">Act</a> No. 309/2002 Coll., on amendments to laws related to the adoption of the Act on the Service of Civil Servants in Administrative Offices. At that time, the salary base for representatives designated by the Act was to be three times the average monthly wage for the year before last. The purpose of this establishment was actually <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=28676\">to establish</a> a &quot; <em>stable link between the salaries of constitutional officials and the development of wages in the non-business sphere</em> &quot; (.doc, p. 36). The procedural history of this provision then consisted primarily in the several postponements of the effectiveness of this act or the annulment of individual provisions of the Act on the Salary of Constitutional Officials by the Constitutional Court. The final <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359\">amendment</a> to Act No. 359/2014 Coll. from 2014 <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=191422&amp;pdf=1\">comes</a> (.pdf) from the pen of Jan Hamáček, the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. The original government proposal (Bohuslav Sobotka&#39;s government) <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=110647\">envisaged</a> (.pdf) a fixed salary of CZK 52,248 for the next four years, and in the end, Hamáček&#39;s amendment was <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=7&amp;t=277\">accepted</a> instead.</p><p> The new salary range was thus determined by determining a new <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359#f5469272\">multiple</a> for deputies (2.75) and a special multiple for judges (3.00). Given the difference between the fixed amount for 2014 and the amount given by the multiple in 2015, Hamáček&#39;s proposal <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359#f5469273\">provided for</a> a gradual annual increase in the multiple over four years. The salary base should thus reach 2.5 times the average wage for the year before last in 2018.</p><p> Petr Fiala and the entire ODS did not vote for either Hamáček&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=60088\">amendment</a> or the final wording <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?G=60089\">of the law</a> . The majority abstained, and in the second vote two deputies were against. Therefore, the expression &quot; <em>we agreed</em> &quot; used by Chairman Fiala in his statement is somewhat questionable.</p><p> As for the meaning of the statement about &quot; <em>creating a solution that we will not have to return to</em> &quot;, the amendment may directly imply an effort after 2018 (when the salary was calculated by a multiple of 2.5) to immediately jump to calculating with a multiple of 2.75 in the following year. According to <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2643791-pirati-a-spd-pozadali-o-schuzi-snemovny-k-platum-bude-asi-16-listopadu\">data</a> from Czech Television (infobox note), however, such a procedure would cause the salary of a deputy and senator to increase by 14,700 CZK. The government, which proposed <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=8&amp;T=167\">an amendment</a> to the Act on the Salaries of Constitutional Officials, is probably aware of this. It <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=135103\">should</a> (.pdf, p. 3) permanently reduce the multiple for the calculation back to 2.5 and also change the average that will be multiplied.</p><p> It was also the ODS&#39;s votes that moved the proposal from the first reading to committees, which means that the Chamber of Deputies, including the ODS, will consider this proposal and will return to addressing the salaries of MPs, thanks to the ODS.</p><p> To summarize the assessment, the timing of the adoption of the amendment is appropriate, but the intention not to return to discussing salaries does not follow from the ODS&#39;s vote so far, which concerns the new government draft amendment (the discussion <a href=\"http://www.psp.cz/eknih/2017ps/stenprot/022schuz/22-1.html\">took place</a> on November 15, 2018).</p>\nSECTION C: <p>In Kladno, after gaining <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1211?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xv=1&amp;xdz=8&amp;xnumnuts=2103&amp;xstat=1&amp;xvyber=0\">202,233 votes</a> , the Volba pro Kladno party won, as in 2014. It thus won 13 seats in the council, which has a total of 33 members. The party will nevertheless eventually head to the opposition. The parties ODS, SPD, ANO and the Kladeňáci movement <a href=\"https://www.irozhlas.cz/volby/volby-2018-komunalni-volby-volba-pro-kladno-opozice_1810071733_dbr\">have agreed</a> to cooperate, and according to the coalition agreement, Dan Jiránek (ODS), who has already led the city in the past, is to be the mayor.</p><p> Petr Fiala <a href=\"https://volby.idnes.cz/kladno-koalice-ods-spd-top-09-hrozba-vylouceni-ze-strany-pip-/volby.aspx?c=A181008_121958_volby_kop\">stated</a> through a press spokesman that the situation in Kladno &quot; <em>is not entirely standard.</em> &quot; And further: &quot; <em>As far as I know, the campaign in Kladno was very heated, accompanied by massive anonymous attacks on the opposition.</em> &quot; ODS deputy chairman Martin Kupka also pointed out the heated nature of the election campaign and <a href=\"https://volby.idnes.cz/kladno-koalice-ods-spd-top-09-hrozba-vylouceni-ze-strany-pip-/volby.aspx?c=A181008_121958_volby_kop\">said</a> about cooperation with the SPD: <em>&quot;It is a coalition that I do not prefer, but I understand the arguments that my colleagues</em> (from the Kladno ODS, note: Demagog.cz) <em>presented to the ODS</em> <em>.</em> &quot;</p><p> However, not every party leadership is as tolerant of the formation of a coalition with the SPD as the ODS leadership. <a href=\"https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/okamura-se-raduje-ods-a-top-09-pomohly-jeho-strane-k-vladnou/r~9a3f8512cab611e8b634ac1f6b220ee8/?redirected=1542212809\">Petr Hašek</a> , a member of TOP 09 and also a member of the Kladeňáci movement, was faced with the choice of either leaving the coalition or the party. In the end, he decided on the latter option.</p><p> The aforementioned escalation of the campaign in Kladno can be proven by the post-election <a href=\"https://kladensky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/povolebni-boj-pokracuje-v-kladne-se-mnozi-trestni-oznameni-20181010.html\">developments</a> . Criminal charges were filed by both the old-new mayor Dan Jiránek from the ODS and representatives of the former mayor Milan Volf (Volba pro Kladno). However, we were unable to find any concrete evidence that would illustrate the escalation of the campaign, nor any credible information about the spreaders of defamatory news.</p><p> Kladno is not the only city where the ODS cell deviated from its preferred line; in other cases, however, it is primarily about cooperation with the KSČM. In <a href=\"https://www.volby.cz/pls/kv2018/kv1111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xid=1&amp;xdz=2&amp;xnumnuts=7104&amp;xobec=513750&amp;xstat=0&amp;xvyber=0\">Hranice,</a> a broad coalition (or rather a &quot; <em>working</em> <a href=\"https://olomouc.idnes.cz/hranice-siroka-koalice-zastupitelstvo-funkce-kritika-opozice-tajemnik-rezignace-gip-/olomouc-zpravy.aspx?c=A181109_438556_olomouc-zpravy_stk\"><em>group</em></a> <em>aimed at developing the city</em> &quot;) was formed of seven parties and movements that made it to the council. These are ANO, the association Our Beautiful Hranice, Hranice for Life, Hranice 2000, the communists, the ODS with the support of the Free Democrats, and the SPD. In response to <a href=\"https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/218411030501104#t=4m38s\">criticism</a> (video, 4:41) of cooperation with the KSČM, the six-member local ODS council in Hranice <a href=\"https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/mistnim-sdruzenim-ods-ktere-spolupracuji-s-kscm-hrozi-zruseni/1683221\">resigned</a> , and the Regional Council <a href=\"https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2644691-hranicka-ods-ma-prijit-o-licenci-duvodem-je-zakazana-povolebni-spoluprace-s\">proposed</a> revoking the license of the local ODS association in Hranice. Given that the ODS is resolving the coalition in Hranice (although more in connection with cooperation with the KSČM, which regional cells are prohibited from doing), Kladno remains the only tolerated city with a coalition with the SPD.</p>\n Respond only with either TRUE or FALSE and the correct section name, examples: TRUE, SECTION A.",
