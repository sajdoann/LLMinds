First, I'd like to give you a very rough overview of what is going to happen in this semester. So this is the course outline. As you see, we start at the end. We will discuss the evaluation first and you will learn very quickly why evaluation is so important for all the research that you are doing. And then, in the next lecture, we will discuss the overview of various approaches to machine translation. This class is called statistical machine translation but nowadays all machine translation systems are statistical in some sense, so we will just say machine translation. It's simply automatic that all the systems are statistical. And that obviously includes neural machine translation. Neural machine translation has changed the field a few years ago, so we're going to discuss it very briefly already on the third lecture and then we'll get to that later on as well. So in the first three lectures we will get like a glimpse and an overview of everything and then from the fourth lecture onwards we'll be a little bit going back in the history and discussing the important algorithms and approaches that finally build up to what we have now, the highly multilingual neural machine translation systems. So these would be the advanced lectures. The field of machine translation is a field which at least to me at the beginning seemed to guarantee that I would get hold of the meaning of the sentence, because it was impossible for me to realize or to think that we would be translating from one language to another language and not operating with the sense, with the meaning of the sentence. Luckily or unfortunately, it depends on the way you look at it, you can deliver perfect translations by some magical components and these components do not understand the meaning of the sentence at all. So it turns out that performing very well in machine translation can be kind of mocked, simulated, faked by just clever copy-pasting and adjusting pieces of texts that humans previously translated. So one of the last lectures towards the end of the semester is also going to be devoted to the question of meaning, how much the systems actually internally kind of understand, whatever it means, and whether the neural MT is making this understanding more accessible or actually less accessible. So we'll discuss that later on. And I'm again highlighting the last point. At the very end of the semester your projects will be presented and that's the cornerstone of this seminar. So it's not only the lectures but it will be also your research work.
