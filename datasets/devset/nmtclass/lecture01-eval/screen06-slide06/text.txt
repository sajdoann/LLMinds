Yeah, so then basic directions of manual evaluation. When you are designing a manual evaluation method, you need to decide what to show to the annotators, what context they should consider, and what are you asking. So what to show? You can show the source text, or you can show the reference translation, which already distorts the scores a bit, because the single reference translation could have highlighted something which was not so important in the source. And so it is really like text interpretation that happens when the translator provides the reference translation. So the source is kind of more reliable but that slows down the process and you need bilingual people to assess that. So the best is possible to show them both but this definitely like changes the overall setting. Then there is the question of context to consider and for many years people in machine translation field focus only on the sentence level. So machine translation systems these days operate on the level of sentences. If you shuffle the sentences you get the same outputs. Well, there is some randomness in the system, so not all the time, but in deterministic systems, yes, you get the same output regardless of the order and there is no cross sentence information or relations preserved. Document level score would be something which asks the human assessor to judge the whole document and say how good it is, whether the cross sentence phenomena are also well preserved. And there you obtain or there you ask for one single score for the whole document. And document aware is something of a mix. You are going to show people smaller pieces, so individual sentences, but you give them the whole context. And you are asking whether these sentences, each of them, is good given the whole source document and also given the whole target output. So then what to ask? You can show people two different outputs or more different outputs and ask them to relatively sort them in some way, so some relative comparison, or you can show people just one output and say how good it is on some scale. And this also has the various consequences on the results of the evaluation. And you can also ask some more complicated questions.
