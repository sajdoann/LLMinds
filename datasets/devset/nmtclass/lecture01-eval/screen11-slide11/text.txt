An underlying reason for this particular result, but we are actually getting towards the time when machine translation will be very much similar in quality to human translation. Here in 2018 the reason was probably this. Humans, when they were producing these reference translations, were translating whole documents and the machines were translating individual segments. No one cared about document level context in 2018. Like we knew that it is important, but we had other problems. And the evaluation was also done at the level of individual segments. So here is the benefit that the MT got. The sentences when judged without the context can seem more natural if they were created without the context. But if you evaluate the sentence in the proper context of the document, then suddenly I'm quite confident that the human scores would be higher. Okay, so that's a very important thing to realize, that you can easily give some benefit to your systems just by the way you design your evaluation. And it's very difficult to be fair in this. So there people have then later on followed up on this and there are many studies that like discuss how much we are on par with humans, but it's the critical question is what you
