Another setup which was run at the same time is this source-based pseudo-document or direct assessment and there you are scoring the sentences one by one as you did before but you are showing the sentences in the original order of the document. So people, the assessors, will actually read the whole article so they will have the context in their heads and they can score the coming sentences worse and worse when they see that the sentences depart from the meaning of the whole document. So it's mentally manageable. But the way it was done, it was again like a very quick hack. There was no way to go back to the previous sentence. So you score the first sentence high because you seemed it makes sense. But then as you were reading the article, you realized there was some very bad word choice in the first sentence and there was no way to indicate it anymore. And another problem is that all the sentences in the whole document must come from the same system. Otherwise you would not be judging the coherence in the document. So that requests for more judgments so that you cover all the systems with sufficient number of judgments. So that's the problem. And another problem that I see here is that these probes, these questions to the humans, are no longer independent of each other. And that's one of the assumptions of the underlying statistical evaluation afterwards. So I'm not so good in statistical tests but I'm afraid some of these statistics can also be skewed by this change.
