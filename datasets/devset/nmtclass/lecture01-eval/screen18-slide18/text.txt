numbers can be tricky. This is just a suggestion for a project, if you still have not decided what your project could be. I've also run a little eye tracking study on this. I had, I think, just eight colleagues, so a small study. They were doing these assessments under an eye tracker. We could also redo that. We have an eye tracker here as well. I was curious what people do mostly. Indeed, they mostly start with reading the source, then they read the reference and then they read one by one the candidates and then they score it. And maybe they could be doing some pairwise comparisons. So this is some analysis which was no longer done with the data. I like the number of pairwise comparisons compared to like rereading and it would be interesting to see whether people like focused on errors and whether the score correlates with the errors appearing there and so on. So this is an invitation for anyone to analyze the data.
