So, better than any other system judged. So, A took part in two screens and out of these two screens it was better than any other system in one case. So, A got one out of two possible points, B got zero of two points and so on, and E is the only system which gets one out of one. Obviously this is too small evaluation, so this is an unreliable number but yeah of the one screen where E was, it was the best system. So based on this score
