evaluation. Here is another way of scoring. This is the GCSE style of evaluation, the maturita in Czech. So we were checking this year how the best systems translate audit reports. It was auditors who assess them, and they use scores similar to what students are tested on when they write their essays for GCSE. So whether the language is used well in spelling and morphology, whether the vocabulary is chosen adequately for the content and whether the text is clear or not clear because of the vocabulary choice, whether the syntax and word order are good and overall whether the text is understandable.

So this indicates that not only in... so this is 2019 so this is the same evaluation where the direct assessment said that significantly humans are better and here in one of the scales it said that significantly the machine was better, so again different questions give you different results. So here's one more test that
