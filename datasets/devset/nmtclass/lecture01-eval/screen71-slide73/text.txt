Because it already feels bad translating the text, which you already have translated, translating it a few more times. We have played around with BLEU scores at the seminary in 2007. And there we were trying... So at that year we were first starting with our English to Czech systems. And we didn't have test sets, which would be in Czech. So we created a test set ourselves. We ourselves created four reference translations. So these are BLEU scores on the same set of sentences, either used in the direction from Czech into English and their professional translators provided the reference translations, or from English to Czech and there was students of maths and physics. So I'm showing this to just give you the idea that the BLEU scores differ a lot. They differ because of the language difference. So here we are comparing human translation against three other human translations. So depending on which you choose the scores will vary and if you then average it the scores will also vary. And for translation into English we were getting scores like 35 or up to 50 and for the other direction English into Czech we were getting scores almost an order of magnitude lower. This is because Czech is harder, there is more words to choose from. And also this is non-professional translation. So if the references are bad, they differ from each other more. So that's why you get fewer n-grams confirmed. But I would like to ask why the number of references is so critical for the actual value of the BLEU score. If you have one reference, it's 35. If you use three references, the score is 52. Can anyone say why the more references you have the higher the score will arise. Because there's a finite number of ways to translate some. Yeah, so that's you are answering exactly correctly. So it boils down to the question to what extent do we match the human translation? And if we have more possible, more allowed human translations there is a bigger chance that our n-grams will be confirmed by any of those. So the more references you have, the higher the chance, the higher the number of n-grams you will score. So the number of references is an absolutely critical information when you score. But the main message that you should learn today is that you should not trust any numbers unless you have evaluated them yourself. So unless you saw the outputs of the system and you ran the evaluation yourself. So there is heavy dependence on the number of references. More differences allow to match more n-grams and there is also heavy dependence on the translation direction and translation quality.
