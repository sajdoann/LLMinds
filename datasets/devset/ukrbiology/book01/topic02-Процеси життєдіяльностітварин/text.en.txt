movement, irritability, reproduction and development of animal organisms.

we use organic substances: they break them down in cells
and store energy for their needs. Energy is needed for movement,
growth, development, reproduction.
In addition, animals use organic substances for
building their own bodies. They convert some organic substances
on others - those that they need.

The structure of the digestive system of animals is related
with their place of life, their way of feeding
and level of organization (Figure 31.2).
Methods of feeding animals:
• filtering (whales, mussels);
• puncture followed by suction
(bedbugs, aphids);
• suction only (butterflies);
• eating food in separate pieces for a while
using jaws, teeth or beak (wolves, birds
etc).

Transport of substances in animals

and closed circulatory systems that perform

Transport of substances in animals
Vessels
The channels for fluid movement are represented by blood vessels.
There are three types of such vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. According to the arte-
teres, the fluid flows from the contractile organ (they have the thickest
walls). Blood flows through the veins to the contractile organ. Capillaries are
the thinnest vessels. They carry out the exchange of substances between the trans-
sports fluid and tissues.
Transport fluid
Transport functions in animals are performed by blood or hemolymph.
The term "blood" is usually used for a fluid that moves
only inside the blood vessels and does not enter the body cavities of the organism.
Accordingly, if the liquid in some areas leaks into the cavities

after several molts. After the first molt, it will be even
small, and then quickly overtakes the surviving claw in size.
Some animals with internal skeletons (e.g., newts) also
can regrow lost limbs. But most of them are capable of
only heal fractures and other injuries. They can
do this because their skeleton is made of living tannin.
A fantastic dream about riding beetles
The body size of animals with external skeletons is limited by the laws of physics. Their muscles
should be placed inside the tubular limbs, and the large limbs should
have thick walls to support the weight of the animal. Because of this, inside the tubular
limbs cannot accommodate muscles with a large cross-sectional area —
it is limited by the diameter of the limb. Namely, the cross-sectional area determines the force
muscles. In this case, the musculoskeletal system will not have enough strength to provide
body movements with a large mass. That's why horse-sized beetles will remain
only in the pages of fantasy novels.

Old age and death
After maturity comes old age — a natural period in life
An animal, when it stops reproducing, becomes less viable.
Her chances of survival decrease, and the likelihood of death increases.
Death is the cessation of existence. Thanks to death on the planet
there is a change of generations, and therefore, evolution takes place. Thus
Thus, the death of an individual contributes to the development of the species.
Indirect postembryonic development
In indirect development, a larva hatches or is born.

between animals and their larvae. For example, butterflies
feed on nectar, and their caterpillars feed on plant leaves; adult frogs
eat insects, while tadpoles feed on plant foods. In addition,
This type of development promotes the settlement of sedentary organisms (for example,
clade, mollusk larvae determine the spread of the species). Indirect
development can manifest itself in two main forms: with full and
incomplete transformation.
Indirect development with complete transformation
Development with complete transformation occurs when there is a stage
rest (pupa) (Fig. 42.3, p. 170). This development is characteristic of
a large number of insects: butterflies, ants, bees, flies, mosquitoes, etc.

organisms, learned to compare the structure of animals of different groups
as a result of adaptation to their environments.
You have become familiar with the main properties and features
animals: nutrition, respiration, excretion, reproduction, growth,
development. Now you can not only talk about the structure and function of
of animal organisms of different groups, but also to find cause-and-effect relationships
connections between them.
Such a connection can also be found between the features of the
markets and environmental factors. It was formed during
evolution and underlies the unity of the organic world.
