are actually evaluating. So one attempt to fix it, but that's a very simple attempt, hacked quickly together for last year's evaluation for 2019, was to, well, ask people to score the whole document. So this is the direct assessment, but instead of one sentence, you see here the whole news article and then you give one number. So obviously this is mentally impossible to score it reliably. And another problem is that you are getting too few judgments. So this will make your statistics run over two small set of numbers, and these statistics are generally unreliable. So that's the problem of a very simple way of handling document level scores.
