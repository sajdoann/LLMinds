There are other languages and in English to German there is this result that the Facebook system appears significantly better than the professional translation. And there is one more thing to realize. Well, there is more speakers and more researchers of German area than for Czech. So the number of participating systems in English to German is very high. It's a very competitive task. And the number of hours that people can spend on assessing them is limited. So there is a huge chunk of incomparable systems. So we have this one that is significantly better than the others, but the others is actually about 20 systems, all that cannot be distinguished. Statistically, they are on par. There is differences between them, but they are in the same chunk. So you have to do many more judgments to see whether Microsoft was better than humans or not. Now with confidence we can say that all these systems are just on par, there were only two systems which were like worse.
