So what was in the past? And let's quickly discuss this because there was a period of 80 years of WMT evaluation where some other simplification was used and it's called the relative ranking. So in the relative ranking, you run by sentences and you are showing the source, the reference, and you are showing five outputs of MT systems. Possibly there could be human output as well, but you would have to pay twice for the test set translation because you would have to... Well, you could run this also without showing the reference, but if you want to show the reference you need to create a separate human translation independently. So this is what you see and this is kind of people who are used to looking at this. It took a while to realize where to put scores, but essentially you put bullet points to indicate that these first two sentences are the best, they are on the same rank and then this one is the worst and these are like on par again somewhere in the middle. So this is the way you would score it. The benefit is that you are saving time, you are reading the source sentence only once and you are assessing five systems at a time. So that is some saving, but the limitation is that the context of the document is not considered and also the interpretation of
