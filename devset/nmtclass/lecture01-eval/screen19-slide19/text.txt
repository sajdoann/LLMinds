And there is the obvious problem that the sentences can be bad at different places. So if the first sentence is bad at the beginning and the second sentence is bad at the end, how do you rank them? Are they both equally bad or what do you do? So that's a sentence level problem already. And now imagine that we are going to evaluate the whole document. So it's absolutely inevitable that these two documents will be incomparable. I would say. So when people are still doing the sentence level evaluation, they deemed a sentence is maybe too long unit to compare, so they also tried doing relative ranking of just a part of a sentence. So here you are given the whole sentence content, but you are assessing only the highlighted phrase. So that gives you some simplification for the annotators, but again you are not evaluating even the whole sentence, so maybe the verb is lost, this method will not notice.
