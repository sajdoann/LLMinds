So here is a little intermezzo. If you have these scores, how do you get the winner of the MT system? And the main message from this is whatever field you are working in, whatever evaluation method is established there, you need to very carefully see what is behind the scenes and what is actually being done. So when interpreting these middle ranks, what you are getting from people is these screens of annotations or we can maybe call them blocks.
