This block of annotation is the dots where you put them. I've simplified it. I'm using four systems here and not five in the picture. But system A was the best here, B and C were on par, and D was the worst, and the annotator even said it's like a little more worse than just one bit worse. So this is one screen. That will show to one person. Then maybe to another person,
