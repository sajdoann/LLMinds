The question is who wins the competition. I would like to highlight that the point of the competition is not really to win. It is only now when the media are following that. The competition was always to see what works best. And the next year you would follow the article, the system description from the previous year of your competitors, of your colleagues. And in a friendly way you would learn what worked for them and you would implement it in your system which is often very different in internals and by this mutual cross-fertilization, that's a favorite word, you would get the best systems altogether. So this is a fast progress and it's not too important who wins. It's definitely like a wrong idea to shake your medals. We are not giving out any medals at the competition and that's for a good reason. So it's because there are many caveats to this evaluation. But anyway, if we want to sort the system in some way, how do we interpret these scores?
