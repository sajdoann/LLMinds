Well, we do this simulated pairwise thing actually. So we interpret all these judgments as pairwise comparisons and here in pairwise comparisons A is compared with B and it is better. A is compared with C and it is better. A is compared with D and it is better and so on. So one screen here creates six pairwise judgments because it's four systems and if you have five systems it creates ten pairwise comparisons.
