But in some cases the results will differ. So in the simulated pairwise, B seems better because it was better than in more pairs, whereas A won more screens, so to say. So I'm showing this again to highlight that the actual calculation of the score can affect what you will get as the end result. And the eye tracking was also performed with the idea in mind, maybe when people are shown five systems at once, we should not interpret these five scores as pairwise comparisons. If they don't do pairwise comparisons, these pairwise comparisons can be unreliable. So we have something which is statistically better because it is based on more numbers, but the human process behind that is less stable. So that is why people keep questioning the way things are evaluated. And this is something that you should always keep questioning.
