And the second person checks whether these corrected sentences, blindly corrected sentences, preserve the meaning. So the second person validates whether the first person has understood. And this is a nice way of evaluation. Again, it is costly in some way, but it's nice because it easily, it directly tells you the proportion of sentences that were correctly understood by the first person who didn't have access to anything else, only to the system output. So that's the, that's the computation.
