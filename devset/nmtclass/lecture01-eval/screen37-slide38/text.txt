Here is another thing. I've talked about the task-based evaluation, so giving people instructions translated by machine and checking whether they do what they are supposed to do. We made a simplification of that. We asked them to answer a quiz-like questions. So we prepared English texts. We found them so that the text will be hopefully written by native speakers, and then we machine translated them into Czech and we equipped each of these texts with three questions and these questions were already in check because we were checking whether the Czech speakers would be able to correctly answer the question given the machine translated or machine produced Czech. And these texts came from different areas it was like when do you meet and where do we go, then directions, how do you get to a monument, some basic quizzes from various areas and also the domain of the machine translation systems which is the news articles. So election chances and similar stuff. So the annotation is Given machine translated snippet answer the questions.
