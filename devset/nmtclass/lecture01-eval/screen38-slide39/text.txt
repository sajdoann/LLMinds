Here is an example. It's from 2010 and like one system is from 2010, one is from 2007. Well, you can read the Czech and there is obvious errors in the outputs, but still you are somewhat able to answer these questions whether a particular institution, DCU, which is the Dublin City University, is on one particular street or not whether there are roundabouts, where there are traffic lights on roundabouts in that city, which seems kind of unnatural for Czech people. And if the description says that you should do something on a roundabout and a traffic light at the roundabout, then you will be able to answer yes and on which side of the street the institution is. Now the problem here is that the questions revealed too much. So in general it was too easy to answer these questions because you were just able to spot even if there was some error in the translation, you were able to spot whether something is mentioned or not. And this mentioning was sufficient. So this kind of explains why gisting machine translation with low quality for a language that you don't speak works so well, if you have the context what's the question. If you know what you are after, you will find it even in some very badly translated output. So that's an approximation of the task
