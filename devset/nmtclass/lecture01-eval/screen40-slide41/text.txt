we've used these superhuman machine translation systems to translate agreements. So this is a sub-lease agreement, something that you could easily be signing if you are living in Prague, because it's non-professionally translated. There is a landlord and he will show you like double-sided agreement. One side will be in Czech, you don't understand it at all. The other side will be in English, some vague, some maybe bad English, but it will indicate what is the agreement about. And then if you are Czech living somewhere else, you may get the agreement in English and you want to machine translate it into Czech so that you understand better. So, well, let's not read this as a whole, but it's some sublease agreement that some person, Marta Boreshova and Karolina Cherna, they are entering this and... Yeah, so there's a lot of details.
