in a big run. And I'm showing these because we're in Prague and while in Prague we must not forget tectogrammatics, the deep representation of the sentence, deep syntactic. And it is very close to what H. Mann and Hume do. So if your other area of studies is in any way related to syntax or deep syntax, if you have worked with the Prague dependency treebank and so on this would be a nice project for you. Use the available tools to get to the deep syntax or there's this universal dependencies that are also going deep in the recent years. So you can you could build an evaluation measure which relies on this deep syntax of the source. So that could be a research question.
