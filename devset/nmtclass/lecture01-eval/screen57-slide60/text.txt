project. A simpler way which doesn't require people to have syntactic knowledge is to just label for errors. So here is a simplified classification of errors that we tried at this seminar and we have asked our colleague students to label words which are wrong. And the words can be wrong for various reasons. So there can be bad word form, the word itself is correct but the form doesn't fit the sentence, or it can be bad sense, and there we were distinguishing two categories, whether it is like clear that it was misunderstood by the system, or whether it was like you cannot really pinpoint where the mistake is, but the meaning of the chosen word doesn't fit the sentence very well. So that's bad disambiguation. And obviously words can be missing, and if they are missing, it can be a missing content word or a missing auxiliary word a and there can be also bad punctuation errors, this is easy, and there can be errors in word order, so maybe some local error or the word can be too far away from its best position, there will be some long-range word-level error. So this is a simpler hierarchy.
