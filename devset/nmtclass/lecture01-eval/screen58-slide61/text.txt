that we used. This is something which got later standardized and the translation industry also uses that, so I need to mention this multi-dimensional quality metrics. They have similar issues. For accuracy they are checking for omission or mistranslation and addition. There can be also words that should not appear in the output and they are also checking for the fluency, which is the spelling, typography and the style or register of the document or whether the whole sentence was totally unintelligible and they are also checking the verity, which is like the practical usability of that sentence in the setting. So the example to illustrate verity is if you are translating driving instructions from German into English and you are doing it for driving in Australia or in the UK and you are saying drive on the left-hand side and you preserve the side of the road then it will cause crashes in those countries. So that's like the local applicability. If the translation will fit the local context of where it is going to be used. So this is the standardized classification of errors and
