So here's an example how the BLEU score correlates badly with humans. It is 2008 results and here you would like to see like a diagonal, the better the higher the BLEU score the better the human rank should be. And that applies to the phrase based systems, a simple version and an improved version, but it doesn't apply to our system which is based on this deep syntax. And also to the commercial system. The commercial system did not care about n-grams, it cared about the users, so it focused on not forgetting the words, if you remember, and it scored well in the human rank and very low in the BLEU score. So that's the correlation.
