So this is what happens here. So we have the direct assessment and we have the Suckerblatt score and we have the individual systems. How well they score in each of these metrics. As you are moving to this part where the good systems are, then it becomes more of a cloud and less of a straight line and actually the seemingly high correlation in this particle language pair was to a big extent caused by this outlier and this second outlier and there it is still like there is some reasonable correlation. But the correlation vanishes when you are limiting yourself to top four systems and these top four systems are actually totally in the reverse order. So there BLEU score correlates negatively. So this is something that we still have to work on. Like what is a fair way of comparing metrics given the underlying set of systems. In each of the languages, language pairs, the set of systems is different, so there is outliers in different areas and we want to avoid outliers, so we want to have some stable and general impression, but then there will be many counter examples. So this picture
