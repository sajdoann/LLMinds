Animal behavior
We will get acquainted with interesting material related to the bodies of
ki characteristics of animals, because only they are characterized by certain behavior.
We know of examples of unique and often inexplicable behavior

So in this section we will try to answer the question
"Why?" What is the biological meaning of this or that behavior?
What elements does it consist of? It answers these questions
the science of ethology, which you will also learn about. After studying this
section, the world of animals will become more understandable and interesting for you.

Homing
The word "homing" comes from the English home -
to return home. This is the name given to the instinct of home, which we can
observed in many animals. This is best seen in animals that
undertake long-distance migrations. These include eels, sea turtles, salmon, and
other animals. They can travel thousands of kilometers, but for
reproductions still return to the place where they were born.
For example, one species of sea turtle reproduces only on certain

there, simultaneously arriving from the shores of Canada and the Mediterranean
sea, and from the Azores. The good memory of these turtles is evidenced by
also the fact that for the first time after birth they enter their native
beach only at the age of 30 - after completing puberty.

Animal behavior
The main forms of behavior are territorial,

include many additional factors, such as
example, hierarchical relationships, ritual behavior,
communication. This generates a significant diversity in
animal behavior.
Territorial behavior

nuts and mushrooms for the winter. The hare's relatives, the pika, even make special stitches
from grass, thus storing food for the winter. Hence the second name of these animals -
haymakers.
Aggressive and defensive behavior
Defensive, or protective, behavior is aimed at avoiding un-
security. It manifests itself in threatening postures, sounds, attacks,
causing injuries. Most animals resort to aggression during
reproduction. In the absence of an aggressor, aggression can accumulate
and aim at any object. Provoke aggressive behavior
An animal that defends a territory it considers its own can also behave this way.
This type of aggressive behavior occurs quite often in dogs.
Although it can be seen in other animals - cats, roosters, lions
etc.
Exploratory behavior
Exploratory behavior is an essential part of the behavior of any
of any animal. When an animal is looking for food, water, shelter, a mate
partner, she engages in exploratory behavior. Thanks to this
type of behavior animals learn about the world around them and know where they are
can find food or other animals of their own kind.
184

Animal behavior
Exploratory behavior is very important for detecting creatures.
This is especially true for herbivores, which are afraid of
predators. Pay attention to how a roe deer or horse approaches
to an unfamiliar place or watering hole (this is often shown in scientific
popular movies). Ears catch every sound, eyes react to
the slightest movements, the nose sniffs and catches the faintest suspects
smells. It is very difficult for a predator to remain unnoticed by such
research animal.
Hygienic behavior
Hygienic behavior of animals is aimed at maintaining cleanliness
body coverings and toileting issues. For nomadic animals,
who move around a lot, there are no special problems with the toilet: where
stopped - there is a toilet there. So they immediately move on. But
sedentary animals have to deal with this issue much more
more seriously, because littering your territory is not very good
idea. In addition, it also increases the risk of getting sick. Given the

which serve as their toilets.
A great example of hygienic behavior is insect hunting in monkeys. In monkeys,

During such examinations, monkeys also remove dead skin scales and hairs,

Such reactions are called social behavior.
Communications
Social behavior increases chances of survival
of the entire group and species. For such groups, the system is important

people communicate using sounds (speech, laughter, clapping),
gestures, body postures, etc. Birds communicate through sounds, postures,

with which hen A will peck any hen, hen B will peck all but
chicken A, chicken B - all except chicken A and chicken B, etc. Such
This type of hierarchy is typical of cows, mice, rats, baboons, etc.
An animal's position in the hierarchy is usually determined by size,
strength, aggressiveness and remains constant in birds in a certain
group.

Types of animal groups

K. Lorenz established that all groups of animals
can be divided into two large groups. The first of them is
anonymous groups that do not have a defined
structures. The second is individualized groups,
which have a certain structure and in which each animal
plays one role or another.
clusters and groupings
Animals can gather together, forming clusters and clumps.
A herd is simply a collection of animals that have gathered together.

in the pond because there is a lot of food there. They do not even form
primitive community and do not distinguish between "their own" and "strangers".
Groups differ from clusters precisely because animals
they can distinguish between "their own" and "strangers". They recognize those who
belongs to their group, and may have a negative attitude towards animals
from other groups.
anonymous groups
Animals from anonymous groups distinguish
members of their group from other animals of the same species
(Fig. 48.1). But they do not distinguish between group members
among themselves. Often used for recognition
there is a smell: this individual smells like a member of our
group, so it is "one of its own."
In different animals, the arrival of a "stranger" to the group
can cause different reactions. If the group
giraffes or kangaroos will be joined by a new person-
on, then others will react to it quite calmly.
After some time, they will get used to the newcomer, and he will become
"their own." Such anonymous groups are called

Types of animal groups
But there are also closed anonymous groups. Their members are
They meet "strangers" very aggressively. For example, rats can
just kill a stranger.
Anonymous groups significantly increase the chances of their members
for survival. They have no leaders, and leading a group
can be any animal. Usually an animal that has noticed danger,
gives a signal. It can be audible (like birds chirping) or have
other nature. Thus, fish that see danger emit special
substances, and their neighbors react to the smell.
individualized groups
In these groups, animals know each other "by face."
Individualized groups are built on personal contacts
animals among themselves. In them, each animal plays a certain role, so
you can see the leaders there. The leaders play the main roles —
dominate other members of the group. But at the same time, such groups

There are many examples of such groups. This is a pack of wolves, a group of
baboons, a pride of lions, even chickens living in a henhouse with one

The ability to recognize individuals of their own group allows animals to
to dream very complex actions. For example, wolves hunt prey, arrange
carrying out real raids.

adaptations of the organism to the environment. Various forms of
behaviors are selected in the process of evolution according to the principle of facilitation

Conclusion
We have considered very important aspects of animal life that are related to
with behavior. Behavior is based on a general property of living things
organisms - irritability. The evolution of animals was aimed at
the development of this property, due to which animals have a nervous
system and reflexes. Reflexes underlie behavior. Further
complication was observed in the appearance of instincts - innate enough

in stable conditions. The ability to learn significantly increased the chances
