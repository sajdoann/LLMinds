      "context": "Compared with an English summer, that of Auckland is but little warmer, though much longer; but the nights in New Zealand are always cool and refreshing.... The days are one hour shorter in the summer, and one hour longer in the winter than in England! of twilight there is little or none.",

      "context": "The southern hemisphere cannot revolve more rapidly than the northern! The distance round a globe would be the same at 50° south as at 50° north, and as the whole globe would revolve once in 24 hours, the surface at the two places would move underneath the Sun with the same velocity, and the light would approach in the morning and recede in the evening in exactly the same manner; yet the very contrary is the fact! The twilight in England in summer is slow and gradual, but in New Zealand it is rapid and abrupt; a difference which is altogether incompatible with the doctrine of the Earth’s rotundity.",
