      "question": "Why does the Sun appear larger when rising and setting than when on the meridian?",
      "context": "The latter (H 5) represents the greater amount of atmosphere which the Sun has to shine through when approaching the horizon; and as the air near the Earth is both more dense and more damp, or holds more watery particles in solution, the light of the Sun must be dilated or enlarged as well as modified in colour.",

      "question": "What is the explanation for the apparent enlargement of the Sun when rising and setting?",
      "context": "“If the angle of the Sun or Moon be taken either with a tube or micrometer when they appear so large to the eye in the horizon, the measure is identical when they are in the meridian and appear to the eye and mind but half the size. The apparent distance of the horizon is three or four times greater than the zenith.",
