      "question": "What motivates the need for incremental machine translation, especially when processing text input?",
      "context": "One of the clear motivations is that the input is still being uttered. So if you are talking about incremental machine translation that means that it is text based so there is some text source but the sentence is not fully complete as you are translating.",
