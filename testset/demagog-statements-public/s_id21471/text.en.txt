statement: And as Prime Minister, I already sent a letter to the President of the European Commission on December 22nd on behalf of the Czech Republic, where I say: our government considers the core to be extremely important, I ask you to take this into account when making decisions, and here I am attaching the decision of our Parliament, which shows that this is what the Czech Republic wants across the political spectrum. additional context:<p>The letter mentioned by Petr Fiala We were unable to find it in publicly available sources, so we contacted the European Commission Representation in the Czech Republic to ask whether the President of the European Commission had received a letter from Prime Minister Petr Fiala with the request that Fiala was talking about.</p><p>The Head of the Press Department of the Representation <a href="https://czechia.representation.ec.europa.eu/novinky-udalosti/tiskove-centrum_cs"> Magdaléna Frouzová</a> confirmed to us that the President of the European Commission Von Der Leyen had received a letter from Fiala: <i>"Yes, we can confirm that the President of the Commission received a letter from the Czech Prime Minister, in which she formulates the position of the Czech government supporting the inclusion of gas and nuclear energy in the EU taxonomy, in full accordance with the resolution adopted by both chambers of the Czech Parliament on 15.12.2021."</i></p><p>Petr Fiala The statement also mentions a resolution of the Czech Parliament. On December 14, 2021, the Chamber of Deputies voted on the PS Resolution on the Necessary Role of Nuclear Energy in the Decarbonization of the Economy. This is a resolution according to which the Chamber of Deputies: notes that the Czech Republic has committed itself to the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal, appreciates that the EU recognizes the right of member states to freely choose the composition of the energy mix, emphasizes that the Czech Republic, due to its geographical conditions, is unable to meet its commitments without the use of nuclear energy, recalls that the important role of nuclear energy has also been confirmed by the President of the European Commission, therefore notes that nuclear energy must be fully recognized as part of the solution for decarbonizing the economy. It cannot be considered just as a "transitional" category, but as a tool that "enables" the low-carbon transformation of the economy and makes it economically and socially sustainable in the long term. The criteria for the sustainability of its low-carbon economic transformation should be technologically neutral and must not differentiate between generations of nuclear facilities or reactor technology. It also states that the Czech Republic intends to temporarily use natural gas in its mix. It calls on the EU to include gas as a transitional source and nuclear energy as a sustainable source. It instructs Andrej Babiš, the outgoing Prime Minister, to present this position to the European Council at its meeting on December 15, 2021. The majority of MPs, with the exception of SPD representatives, voted in favor of this proposal.
