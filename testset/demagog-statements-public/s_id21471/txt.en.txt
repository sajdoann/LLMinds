statement:
And I, as Prime Minister, I think, on 22 December, sent a letter to the President of the European Commission on behalf of the Czech Republic saying: our government considers the core to be extremely important, I ask you to take this into account in your decision-making, and I attach here a decision of our Parliament which shows that across the political spectrum the Czech Republic wants this.
Additional context:
<p>We have not been able to find the letter referred to by Petr Fiala in publicly available sources, so we have contacted the Representation of the European Commission in the&nbsp;Czech Republic to ask whether the President of the European Commission has received a letter from Prime Minister Petr Fiala with the&nbsp;request referred to by Fiala.</p><p>Head of the Press Department of the Representation <a href="https://czechia.representation.ec.europa. eu/news-events/press-centre_cs"&gt;Magdaléna Frouzová</a> confirmed to us that European Commission President Von Der Leyen had received a letter from Fiala: <i>"Yes, we can confirm that the President of the Commission has received a letter from the Czech Prime Minister, in which she formulates the position of the Czech government supporting the inclusion of gas and nuclear energy in the EU taxonomy, in full compliance with the resolution adopted by both chambers of the Czech Parliament on 15. </i></p><p>In his statement, Petr Fiala also mentions the resolution of the Czech Parliament. On 14 December 2021, the Chamber of Deputies <a href="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2021ps/stenprot/004schuz/bqbs/b02100901.htm">voted</a> on the <i>Resolution on the necessary role of nuclear energy in the decarbonisation of the economy</i>. It is &lt;a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/cms.sqw? z=15300"&gt;resolution</a>, under which the Chamber of Deputies: </p><ul><li>Notes that the Czech Republic has signed up to the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement and in the the Green Deal for Europe,</li><li>appreciates that the EU recognises the right of Member States to freely choose the composition of the energy mix,</li><li>stresses that the Czech Republic, due to its geographical conditions, is unable to meet its commitments without the use of nuclear energy,</li><li>recalls that the important role of nuclear energy has been confirmed by the President of the European Commission,</li><li>therefore notes that nuclear energy must be fully recognised as part of the solution to decarbonising the economy. It must not be seen as a ‘transitional’ category, but as a tool that ‘enables’ the low-carbon transformation of the economy and makes it economically and socially sustainable in the long term. Its criteria for the sustainability of the low-carbon transformation of the economy are to be technology neutral and must not discriminate either by generation of nuclear installations or by reactor technology,</li><li>also notes that the Czech Republic intends to use natural gas in its mix on a temporary basis,</li><li>calls on the EU to include gas as a transitional resource and nuclear energy as a sustainable resource,</li><li>instructs Andrej Babiš, Prime Minister in office, to present this position to the European Council at its meeting on 15 March 2008. </li></ul><p><a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=77438&amp;l=cz"></a> A majority of MEPs, with the exception of the SPD, were in<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=77438&amp;l=cz">favour of</a> the proposal. The House resolution <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/senat-ve-shode-se-snemovnou-podporil-vyuzivani-jaderne-energie/2133449">was supported by the</a> Senate the following day.</p>
