statement:
I would like to recall the statements of former Finance Minister Schillerová from the spring of last year, when she said that the path to budget consolidation lies, among other things, in not valorizing, not increasing the salaries of employees in the state sector. And that only the salaries of teachers, firefighters, police officers, and so on will increase. And that's exactly what we did.
additional context:
<p>In the spring of 2021, Alena Schillerová <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/ekonomika/statni-zamestnanci-platy-za-rok-2020-vzrust-prumerneho-platu_2105150933_kuc">spoke</a> about freezing the salaries of civil servants. According to the former Minister of Finance, salaries should be increased only for teachers, healthcare workers and social service workers as part of the consolidation of public finances. In&nbsp;<a href="https://cnn.iprima.cz/pojdme-rusit-danove-vyjimky-vyzvala-alena-schillerova-dane-pry-zvysovat-nechce-23442">April</a>, she stated several times <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/schillerova-chci-obnovit-eet-40358028">that she did not want to reduce the salaries of firefighters and&nbsp;police officers, but she did not talk about increasing their salaries.</p><p>Let us also add that in&nbsp;<a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3326254-odbory-kritizuji-plan-na-zmrazeni-platu-statnich-zamestnancu-schillerova-na-nem">June 2021</a>, the government approved Andrej Babiš's draft state budget, which envisaged that the salary freeze would apply not only to civil servants, but also to police officers, firefighters and soldiers. The only exception was to be teachers' salaries. Alena Schillerová stated at the time that the government could not afford to increase the salaries of civil servants due to the high state budget deficit.</p><p>The then Minister of the Interior Hamáček had long opposed the freezing of the salaries of police officers and firefighters, who, on the contrary, proposed a salary increase for these groups of 3.5%.</p><p>However, in September 2021, former Minister Schillerová finally reversed course and href="https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/platy-statnich-zamestnancu-nakonec-vzrostou-potvrdila-poprve-schillerova-40372366">agreed</a> to increase the salaries of all state employees, including firefighters and police officers, even though debates continued over the rate of increase. The ČSSD opposed a percentage increase and proposed a fixed monetary amount. In mid-November, the government of Andrej Babiš finally approved a blanket increase in the salaries of state employees by more than a thousand crowns, starting in January 2022.</p><p>The government of Petr Fiala <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3398176-zive-vlada-k-mimoradne-pomoci-kvuli-zdrazovani-energii"> href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/vlada-prida-socialnim-pracovnikum-zdravotnikum-a-ucitelum/2138652">approved</a> a salary increase for only some state employees on December 29, 2021. The new government had previously announced that it did not agree with a general increase. Salaries of social service workers are to increase by 700 crowns from January 2022, salaries of health workers by 6% and teachers by 2%. The government also approved an increase in the salaries of soldiers, firefighters and police officers by 700 crowns. The government of Petr Fiala has decided to freeze the salaries of civil servants in ministries and other offices from January.</p><p>In the spring of last year, Alena Schillerová publicly stated that she wanted to save on the salaries of civil servants as part of the consolidation. She wanted to increase salaries only for teachers, health workers and social service workers. In September, she proposed increasing salaries for all civil servants. However, neither position corresponds to the move by the Fiala government. She agreed to an increase for more groups of employees than Alena Schillerová proposed in the spring, but at the same time the new cabinet increased salaries less than the then minister had planned in September.</p><p>Petr Fiala thus incorrectly states that his government did exactly what Alena Schillerová proposed. In addition, the Prime Minister points out the former minister's alleged hypocrisy by drawing attention to her relatively restrictive position from the spring, but neglecting her more budgetary relaxed position from September 2021.</p>
