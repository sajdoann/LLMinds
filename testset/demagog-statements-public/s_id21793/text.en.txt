statement:Mr. Balák did not personally enrich himself in this case. Secondly, no economic damage was caused. And thirdly, he received three years in prison for allegedly favoring a construction company, by the way, it was the Kladno company ESG with Jaromír Jágr, (...) and the favor consisted of allowing it to tour the Lánská obory.
additional context:
<p>President Zeman <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/milos-balak-milost-lany-prezident-zeman-zduvodneni-ustni-zadost_2204160500_tec">granted</a> on March 26, 2022 a pardon to Miloš Balák, director of the Lány Forest Administration, which is a contributory organization of the Office of the President of the Republic. Balák was sentenced to three years in prison in May last year for manipulating a contract to secure and drain the slopes of the water reservoir in Lány. He also <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">received</a> a fine of 1.8 million crowns and a ban on working in the state administration for four years (counting from his release from prison). The sentence was subsequently confirmed by the Regional Court in Prague on March 24, 2022. In addition to Miloš Balák, the manager of the Energie - stavební a báňská (ESB) company, Libor Tkadlec, was also sentenced. The court gave him probation and a fine of 600,000 crowns. The ESB company received a fine of 5.4 million crowns and a ban on participating in public procurement for 3 years. Let us add that although Miloš Zeman uses the abbreviation "ESG", he clearly means the company ESB.</p><p>The whole case <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3459550-balak-z-lesni-spravy-lany-musi-na-tri-roky-do-vezeni-potvrdil-soud">results</a> from the manipulation of a public contract worth more than 200 million crowns. Specifically, it concerns a tender for securing and draining the slopes of the Klíčava reservoir in the Lánská oboře.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">judgment</a> of the court, Miloš Balák determined the contractor in advance. At the same time, he allowed ESB to participate in the preparation of the project and made non-public information available to the company, which the company used to win the tender. Libor Tkadlec then mentioned in the interviews that he planned to overvalue some of the contract items. The police also had an expert opinion prepared to calculate the profit from the unauthorized acquisition of the contract. ESB's profit was supposed to be almost 9 million crowns, but due to the initiation of criminal proceedings, this <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/lesni-sprava-lany-soud-milos-balak-libor-tkadlec-obzaloba-zakazka_2105070933_ban">did not happen</a>. <i>"It's a minimalist option. It could easily have been more, considering how the defendants planned it,"</i> <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">commented</a> the amount of the judge who issued a non-final verdict on the entire case last year.</p><p>According to police wiretaps, <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">Libor Tkadlec planned to obtain tens of millions of crowns from the budget of the Office of the President of the Republic. However, due to the police activity, Chancellor Mynář had part of the ongoing work stopped, and the final price of the tender was 191 million crowns. Originally, however, the value of the contract was supposed to be 230 million.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.energie-as.cz/management-spolecnosti.html?id=128">ESB's board of directors</a> includes hockey player Jaromír Jágr. However, it is important to mention that he was not a member of the board during the illegal actions. He only became one in 2021, the case itself with Miloš Balák <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/soud-balak-vezeni/r~b5a3243aaefc11ebb0fa0cc47ab5f122/">started</a> after a police raid in Lány in 2017. At that time, however, his father, Jaromír Jágr Sr., was the vice-chairman of the board of directors. Let us add that the head of the Lán Forest Administration is now being indicted in another case. He was supposed to <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/lany-misto-kamenolomu-terenni-upravy/r~efd3b39ac08511ecb5bd0cc47ab5f122/">turn</a> the Lany area into a quarry without the appropriate permit, extract a total of 40,000 tons of stone, and then sell part of it at a low price to the ESB company, which also figured in the case of the modification of the slopes of the water reservoir.</p><p>Finally, let's summarize our assessment. From the available information, it is not clear that Miloš Balák directly enriched himself by favoring ESB. It is also not clear whether the state suffered financial damage. ESB's profit from the illegal acquisition of the contract was supposed to be almost 9 million crowns (according to the court, at least 9 million), but due to the initiation of criminal prosecution, this did not happen.</p><p>Nevertheless, we assess Miloš Zeman's statement as untrue. It is not true that Balák only allowed ESB to inspect the Lánská obora before the tender was announced. Based on the court ruling, it is clear that he cooperated with Balák on the project planning and provided it with non-public information even before the tender was announced. According to the court, the head of the forest administration thus determined the contractor in advance.</p>
