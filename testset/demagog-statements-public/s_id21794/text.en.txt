statement: Václav Havel gave two thousand pardons, Václav Klaus four hundred, I twenty, or more precisely twenty-one. Among these pardons there was no parricide, because Václav Havel pardoned the parricide Mr. Odložil, there was no restitution fraudster, while Václav Havel pardoned Mrs. Chadimová, who was then defended by Pavel Rychetský.
additional context:
<p>Václav Havel <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/1061767-zeman-bude-udelovat-jen-nektere-milosti-tridit-je-bude-ministerstvo">granted</a> pardons to a total of 860 people between 1993 and 2002 and more than 1,000 pardons during his time as federal president. In contrast, Václav Klaus pardoned 412 people in his 10 years in office. Miloš Zeman actually pardoned 21 people.</p><p>Let us now focus on the individual cases of pardons granted by Václav Havel, which Miloš Zeman criticizes. Martin Odložil, the son of the famous gymnast Věra Čáslavská, in 1993, during an argument <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/kajinek-neni-prvni-havel-a-klaus-take-davali-sporne-milosti/r~888b87d8372511e79680002590604f2e/v~sl:9e8fcf6d9cb6f33bc09339aea463d111/">hit</a> his father Josef Odložil. He hit his head as a result of the unfortunate fall and died. The police then charged Martin Odložil with grievous bodily harm resulting in death and the court sent him to prison for four years without a final decision. Before the appeals court could decide the case, President Havel granted Odložil clemency. Although Martin Odložil was not charged with murder, in 2011 he <a href="https://www.lidovky.cz/relax/lide/pohnute-osudy-syn-very-caslavske-zabil-sveho-otce-od-vezeni-ho-zachranila-milost.A160303_201015_lide_ele">spoke</a> about killing his father. The term "patricide" is nevertheless very simplistic.</p><p>Marta Chadimová <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/kajinek-neni-prvni-havel-a-klaus-take-davali-sporne-milosti/r~888b87d8372511e79680002590604f2e/v~sl:0eb05e51241930648939959bb7240a9f/">was</a> in 1992 <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/chadimova-po-letech-vyuzila-milost.A031031_123202_domaci_jan">accused</a> of fraud, forgery and alteration of public documents and obstructing the execution of an official decision, in connection with the restitution of a house on Loretánské Square. The then President Havel granted her a pardon in 1995. In the Czech News Agency, he said: "She is in custody for the third time, (...) the trial has been going on for three and a half years, there is no end in sight, the verdict is not in sight and she is very seriously ill." Chadimová only accepted the pardon in 2003, when the trial had already dragged on for over 10 years. Pavel Rychetský was <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/soudce-jiri-kulvejt-zkolaboval-v-budove-vrchniho-soudu-v-praze.A130129_144200_domaci_jav">really</a> one of Marta Chadimová's defense lawyers. Miloš Zeman calls Marta Chadimová a restitution fraudster. However, a final judgment was never issued, so this designation is again relatively simplistic. We therefore assess the statement as true with reservations.</p><p>In conclusion, let us state that Miloš Zeman, in an interview for CNN Prima NEWS, compares these controversial pardons of Václav Havel with the pardon he granted to his subordinate Miloš Balák, the head of the <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3459550-balak-z-lesni-spravy-lany-musi-na-tri-roky-do-vezeni-potvrdvil-soud">Forest Administration</a> of Lány. He was <a href="https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/prezident-zeman-udelil-milost-obvinenemu-sefovi-lanske-obory-balakovi/2184952">finally</a> convicted of influencing a public procurement contract in the Lánská obor. President <a href="https://www.hrad.cz/cs/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/aktualni-tiskove-zpravy/prezident-republiky-udelil-milost-16350#from-list">Zeman</a> justified his decision to grant a pardon, among other things, by saying that Balák was <i>"an exceptionally hard-working and qualified senior employee"</i>.</p>
