statement: In the past, there have been judgments where the Constitutional Court stated that, for example, it found some doubts about the legislative process, but did not change the substance or said that the substance had some defects from the Constitutional Court's perspective, but gave a deadline or said how it would see the correction. additional context:<p><strong>Context&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka is talking about a possible decision by the Constitutional Court (ÚS) in the matter of the newly adopted reduction in pension valorization in June 2023. Currently, the ANO movement is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqIebm42vdI">working</a> (video) on complaints (or <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p64-1">draft</a> on <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-1#cl87-1-a">repeal</a> of the law), which it wants to challenge the amendment to the act on pension valorization. The SPD movement also wants to <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572040-na ustavni-soud-se-opozice-obrati-jakmile-zmena-valorizace-duchodu-vyjde-ve-sbirce">join</a> the submission.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us note that due to the newly adopted amendment to the law, which <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu">was also signed</a> by President Petr Pavel, during the extraordinary valorization of pensions in June <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">will increase</a> pensions on average by only 760 CZK (<a href="https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/">.doc</a>, p.&nbsp;1). According to the previously valid <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22604">rules</a>, the average pension was to increase by <a href="https://www.penize.cz/starobni-duchod/439182-zvyseni-duchodu-v-cervnu-spocitejte-si-rozdil-valorizace">1,770 CZK</a>.

The government now expects pension spending to increase by only CZK 15 billion (<a href="https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/ALBSCP3NBAM8/">.doc</a>, pp. 5–6).</p><p>The opposition <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572110-prezident-pavel-podepsal-snizeni-cervnove-mimoradne-valorizace-duchodu">cites</a> several reasons for submitting a proposal to the Constitutional Court. The first is the so-called <a href="https://cit.vfu.cz/ppoz/okruhypdf/1pravnipredpisyzakladnipojmyadruhypravnichpredpisu.pdf">retroactivity</a> (.pdf, pp. 2–3), or retroactivity. The opposition movement <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">claims</a> that in the case of the amendment, the change in the legal regulation was approved only after the <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-3">valorization mechanism</a> was launched. "<i>We believe that it was created on January 31," </i><a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">justifies</a> Alena Schillerová's retroactivity as one of the pillars of the prepared proposal, because the amendment only entered into force <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71">effectiveness</a> after the mentioned date, specifically March 20, 2023.</p><p>As a second reason for submitting a proposal to repeal the amendment, the ANO movement <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">reports</a> the state of legislative emergency declared by the government, thanks to which the submitted government proposal <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hp.sqw?k=314">is being discussed</a> in an abbreviated session. Such a state of emergency can be declared under <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#f1609384">Act</a> No. 90/1995 Coll., on the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies, <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-90#p99-1">declare</a> in an emergency, "<i>when the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens or the security of the state are fundamentally threatened or when the state is threatened with significant economic damage</i>". The opposition wants to refute the government's argument that the state of legislative emergency was declared precisely because of the risk of "major economic damage", as it believes that it was unjustified.&nbsp;</p><p>Opposition parties <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">can</a> submit a proposal from March 20, when the amendment <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71">was published</a> in the <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392">Collection of Laws</a>. According to the chairwoman of the ANO parliamentary group, Alena Schillerová, the proposal to the Constitutional Court could <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">be submitted</a> in early May. On March 19, the movement's deputy chairman Radek Vondráček <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-opozice-uz-sepisuje-ustavni-stiznost-k-duchodum-hotova-bude-ale-az-v-kvetnu-228022">stated</a> that this could happen within a month.</p><p>After discussing the proposal, the Constitutional Court will then <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1993-182#p70-1">decide</a> whether the law or its individual provisions are in conflict with the constitution. If the constitutional order has been violated, the court may annul the law in question (in this case, the <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=392">amendment</a> to the Act on Lower Pension Valorization) and order the relevant state authority to restore the status quo prior to the violation of the Constitution. In the past, however, although the Constitutional Court did not consider the decision unconstitutional, it published the so-called <i> obiter dictum</i>, which is a <a href="https://www.ceska-justice.cz/2020/04/praha-7-ustavni-stiznost-kvuli-koronavirovym-opatrenim-nestahne-jde-nam-judikat-budoucna-tvrdi-starosta-i-pravnici/">non-authoritative</a> statement beyond the basic reasoning (<a href="https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf">.pdf</a>, p. 11).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judgment on the declaration of a state of emergency</strong></p><p>Marian Jurečka mentions the case law when the Constitutional Court found doubts in the manner extension of the state of emergency. For example, this is what happened in March 2021. At that time, the Constitutional Court considered a proposal by a group of senators to cancel the resolution of the government of Andrej Babiš (ANO) due to the declaration of a state of emergency at the request of the governors, which occurred immediately after the <a href="https://www.vlada.cz/cz/clenove-vlady/historie-minulych-vlad/prehled-vlad-cr/1993-2018-cr/andrej-babis-ii/prehled-clenu-vlady-andreje-babise-27-6-2018-trva-175411/"> href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/koronavirus-v-cesku-nouzovy-stav-senat_2102171308_pj">The Senate</a> did not pass the proposal to extend the previous state of emergency.</p><p>The Constitutional Court rejected the proposal (<a href="https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf">.pdf</a>, p. 1), stating that it is not within its competence to decide on such a proposal (.pdf, p. 7. 12). However, as an <i>obiter dictum</i>, he stated (<a href="https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2021/Usneseni/Pl._US_12_21_vcetne_disentu.pdf">.pdf</a>, p. 7) that "<i>a state of emergency cannot be 'newly' declared by the government from the moment the 'authorized' state of emergency has ended and the Chamber of Deputies has not agreed to its extension</i>". Within the framework of <i>obiter dictum</i>, the Constitutional Court can submit a non-binding statement (<a href="https://www.jurisprudence.cz/cz/casopis/obiter-dictum-a-jeho-misto-a-funkce-v-ceskem-pravnim-systemu.dm-547.pdf">.pdf</a>, p. 11) or recommendations for the legislative process.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us add that in the debate with Minister Jurečka, the moderator asked about option B in the event that the Constitutional Court "swept away" the amendment, i.e. if it recognized it as unconstitutional, and thus ordered the government to restore the status quo before the violation of the constitutional system. In such a case, the situation described by Marian Jurečka, that the Constitutional Court would not "<i>change the essence" of the amendment, would not occur. Since the decisions of the Constitutional Court are <a href="https://www.usoud.cz/postaveni-a-pravomoci">binding</a>, the <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2023-71">amended</a> law would have to return to its original form.</p><p><strong>Rule on the Amendment to the Pandemic Act</strong></p><p>In 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled (<a href="https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf">.pdf</a>) in a similar case, where a group of deputies led by Radek Vondráček (ANO) challenged the <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=9&amp;t=127">use</a> of the state of legislative emergency to discussion of the <a href="http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2022-39">amendment</a> of the pandemic act (Act No. 39/2022 Coll.) at the beginning of 2022. In September 2022, the Constitutional Court rejected the proposal of the opposition deputies (<a href="https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Tiskova_mluvci/Publikovane_nalezy/2022/Pl._US_7_22_na_web.pdf">.pdf</a>, p. 1), but stated in its ruling (p. 24) that <i>"the process leading to the adoption of Act No. 39/2022 Coll. cannot be considered – at the sub-constitutional level – as flawless"</i> and noted in passing that <i>"the legislative process under review and its course can be considered a reflection of the current political culture, the state of which is characterized, among other things, by numerous obstructionist actions, the chaotic agenda and course of meetings, as well as the inflexibility of the legislative process".</i></p><p><strong>Final assessment&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Marian Jurečka truthfully states that in the past, when rejecting proposals to repeal a law, the Constitutional Court used to provide non-binding statements, so-called obiter dictums, in which, for example, it found doubts in the legislative process. For this reason, we assess the statement as true.</p>
