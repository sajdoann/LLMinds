statement:On Friday (March 17, 2023, note by Demagog.cz), information appeared that was not from me, I immediately responded to it, I denied that I would not submit an amendment to this act (regulating the valorization mechanism, note by Demagog.cz) to the government either this week or next week until negotiations with social partners, with the opposition, and I had completed the proper interdepartmental comment procedure. (...) I also wrote this clearly yesterday under the account of the Chairwoman Alena Schillerová on Twitter.
additional context:<p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) is responding to criticism from ANO MP Klára Dostálová, who commented in the debate on the government's poor communication regarding the planned adjustment of the parameters for regular valorization of pensions. According to MP Dostálová, Marian Jurečka wants to submit this amendment too quickly, and therefore there will be no time for thorough discussion with the opposition. The head of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs responded by saying that he was not going to submit the amendment in the near future, and pointed out that he had previously objected to such information.</p><p><strong>Statement on the negotiations in the week of March 20–26</strong></p><p>First of all, let us mention that the spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MLSA) Eva Davidová told ČTK on Friday, March 17, 2023 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230327123710/https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2340047">that the government could discuss the amendment, which would amend the rules for pension valorization, as early as the week of March 20th to 26th. Eva Davidová expressed the same opinion on the <a href="https://cnn.iprima.cz/porady/zpravy/17032023-0">CNN Prima News</a> television broadcast (video, 1:54–3:00 p.m.). Here, among other things, she stated that she expected the proposal to be <i>"approved by the government within the next week"</i> (video, 14:54).</p><p>Later on the same day, however, Marian Jurečka <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-zmeny-valorizaci-penzi-nejsou-na-poradu-dne-jurecka-slibil-standardni-legislativni-proces-40426160">announced</a> that Petr Fiala's cabinet would <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572522-jurecka-chce-v-pristich-tydnech-jednat-o-zmene-valorizace-duchodu-s-opozici-i-odbory">not</a> discuss such a proposal in the aforementioned week. At the press conference, he specifically stated (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/mpsvcz/videos/615199293757846">video</a>, 3:10): <i>"I have started negotiations with representatives of the opposition, in the next few days I will also negotiate (…) with colleagues from the SPD and also with representatives of trade unions and employers. When I have conducted these consultations with them (…), only then will the interdepartmental comment procedure begin and only then will such material go to the government."</i></p><p>Let us mention that Marian Jurečka <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3572522-jurecka-chce-v-pristich-tydnech-jednat-o-zmene-valorizace-duchodu-s-opozici-i-odbory">met</a> before the press conference. The chairwoman of the ANO parliamentary group, Alena Schillerová, later told the daily Právo <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-vlada-s-trvalymi-zmenami-penzi-specha-mely-by-platit-uz-od-leta-40426389">that Minister Jurečka should have handed over only a questionnaire regarding the reform to the participants in the meeting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Statements about the meeting at the beginning of April</strong></p><p>However, on March 17, it became relatively difficult to understand the individual statements of the representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. The situation was repeated again when the ministry spokesperson stated information that Minister Jurečka subsequently denied.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-vlada-projedna-zmenu-v-navysovani-penzi-v-dubnu-variantu-ma-pouze-jednu-227939">Seznam Zprávy</a> server reported in its article on Friday, March 17, that according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230317122628/https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-politika-vlada-projedna-zmenu-v-navysovani-penzi-v-dubnu-variantu-ma-pouze-jednu-227939">spokesperson</a> of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the government should approve the adjustment of the valorizations <i>"at its meeting early April". The spokeswoman made the same statement on Monday <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-vlada-s-trvalymi-zmenami-penzi-specha-mely-by-platit-uz-od-leta-40426389">March 20</a> for the daily Právo, which published her quote the following day (<i>Právo</i>, March 21, 2023, p.&nbsp;1). Representatives of the ANO movement subsequently reacted to this.</p><p>Among other things, MP Schillerová criticized Minister Jurečka on her Twitter account, where she wrote: <i>“The information that [Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka] plans to submit fundamental changes to the valorization mechanisms to the government at the beginning of April, effective from July, is absolutely shocking. Especially if the meeting with us, the strongest opposition party, is to take place at the same time. That is a mockery.”</i></p><p>However, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs subsequently opposed this in the discussion under the post <a href="https://twitter.com/MJureka/status/1638269197963907072">reserved</a>:</p><figure class="embed"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="cs" dir="ltr">And did you notice that I denied this information, which appeared in the media space, on Friday?

According to the ČT24 server, the government coalition wants to count only a third of the growth in real wages into the proper increase in pensions, not <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1995-155#p67-8">half</a>, as is the case now. Let us add that Marian Jurečka <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3573198-jurecka-s-opozici-jedna-o-dalsim-zpomaleni-rustu-penzi-dohoda-je-ale-v-nedohlednu">also wants</a> to reduce the benefits of early retirement.</p><p>With SPD representatives, Marian Jurečka <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-fiala-spd-po-jednani-s-jurecká-odmitame-snizeni-realnych-duchodu-40426514?fbclid=IwAR05IcQiNxPhTmXIzrFhjmPRUyeRj5nSNB6rbL5ivn8J5wiDUSO jS1V-aJM#source=hp&amp;seq_no=10&amp;dop_ab_variant=0&amp;dop_source_zone_name=novinky.sznhp.box&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_medium=z-boxiku&amp;utm_source=www.seznam.cz">sešel</a> March 22.

He also said that his pension commission would also include representatives of opposition movements.</p><p>Let us add that the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions (ČMKOS) criticized Minister Jureček for his communication <a href="https://www.cmkos.cz/cs/obsah/219/tiskova-zprava-vlada-je-patrne-bezradna-zrejme-proto-tresta/333054">in February of this year.

He often sends the really important materials late and denies his own words.”</i></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>On Friday, March 17, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs spokeswoman Eva Davidová told ČTK that Petr Fiala's government was preparing to discuss the proposal to change the rules for pension valorization in the week from March 20 to 26. Later that same day, however, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka said that the cabinet would not discuss the proposal in that week. According to him, negotiations with representatives of the opposition, trade unions and employers should first take place and only then should the proposal be sent to the commenting institution. Only then should the government discuss possible changes to the valorization.</p><p>A similar situation occurred in the case of the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs that the government would approve the adjustment of the valorization at the beginning of April. Marian Jurečka actually wrote on Twitter under Alena Schillerová's post that the proposal would first be discussed with the opposition and other partners. For these reasons, we assess the statement as true.</p>
