Statement: We pay the housing allowance within the deadlines set by law. In most regions, we are between 15 and 21 days. In Prague, we are at the limit of around 30 days. And in 98 percent of cases, this is only because we have asked the client to deliver something to us, and he has not yet provided us with the requested document or information. Additional context: <p>Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka (KDU-ČSL) is talking about the length of the housing allowance application process, not the time period between processing the application and paying the allowance – the editor is asking about the system for granting social benefits, not about their payment. Jurečka, with his words <i>"we pay the housing allowance within the terms given to us by law"</i>, clearly points out that timely processing of the application helps to pay the allowance for the retroactively recognized period within the statutory deadline. However, he then relates the mentioned number of days to the length of the procedure itself. Let us state that the deadline for processing an application for housing allowance is, according to the Administrative Code, <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p71-3">30 days</a>, or up to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-500#p71-3-a">60</a> days if it is a complex case or if the Labour Office <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/socialni-davky-prispevek-na-bydleni-zpozdeni-urad-prace-jurecka_2303291008_ako">carry out</a> a social investigation (<a href="https://www.ochrance.cz/letaky/rizeni-o-davkach-pomoci-v-hn/rizeni-o-davkach-pomoci-v-hn.pdf">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;2).</p><p>We could not find statistics on the length of the housing allowance application process in publicly available sources. We therefore asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MPSV) to send us the data that Minister Jureček draws on in his statement. We subsequently received a graph with internal data from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, which documents the average processing time for applications for housing allowance within the individual regional directorates of the Labour Office in the period from June 1 to July 28 of this year. However, the average processing time alone does not exclude the possibility that in individual cases applications could be processed beyond the statutory deadline. Likewise, the graph did not in any way support Minister Jurečka's claim that <i>"in&nbsp;98 percent of cases&nbsp;</i> (the processing of an application takes around the 30&nbsp;days, note:&nbsp;Demagog.cz) <i>it is only because we have asked the client to deliver something to us, and he has not yet provided us with the requested document or information".</i></p><p>We therefore contacted the Ministry again with a request for statistics on all cases where the deadline was met and when it was not, and also for substantiation of the claim about the reasons for the 30&nbsp;days for processing applications for the allowance in Prague. However, we have not received another response, and&nbsp;we therefore assess the statement as unverifiable.</p>
