statement: If we look at the increase in the number of foreigners in our society in general, in 2020 the number of foreigners in our society was about 6.5%. Currently, it is about 11.5%, 11–11.5%, it is twice the number of foreigners. Criminal activity by foreigners in 2020 was 8.5%, this year it is 11.5%.
additional context:
<p>Interior Minister Vít Rakušan is responding with this statement to <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22915">words</a> by Tomi Okamura, who spoke about&nbsp;criminality by foreigners and&nbsp;mentioned that last year&nbsp;most offenses committed by foreigners were committed by Ukrainian citizens. In his response, the Austrian stated that with the <a href="https://demagog.cz/vyrok/22920">increase</a> in the number of Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, it is logical that <i>"criminal activity is also increasing in&nbsp;this group"</i>. In the statement we verified, it illustrates that the increase in crime committed by foreigners does not correspond to the overall increase in foreigners living in the Czech Republic.</p><p><strong>Number of foreigners</strong> <strong>in the Czech Republic</strong></p><p>According to the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO), in 2020, a total of 10,701,777 inhabitants lived in the Czech Republic (<a href="https://www.czso.cz/documents/11350/121768518/oby032221.xlsx/a8c817b5-693f-4cbd-8462-ca838eaed251?version=1.0">.xlsx</a>). This number <a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/pocet_obyvatel_m">includes</a> both citizens of the Czech Republic and foreigners. The Ministry of the Interior's annual report on the state of public administration states that 634,790 foreigners were residing in the Czech Republic at the end of the year (<a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/vyrocni-zprava-o-stavu-verejne-spravy-v-cr-vr-2020.aspx">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;34). The representation of foreigners in society at the end of 2020 was approximately 5.9% ( <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/migrace/soubor/zprava-o- situaciu-v-oblasti-migrace-a-integrace-cizincu-na-uzemi-ceske-republiky-v-roce-2021.aspx">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;77).</p><p>The latest data on the number of inhabitants <a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/cri/pohyb-obyvatelstva-1-ctvrtleti-2023">was published</a> by the CZSO on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230901124029/https:/www.czso.cz/csu/czso/obyvatelstvo_lide">March 31</a> 2023, when the republic had 10,850,620 inhabitants. According to the Ministry of the Interior, on the same date, a total of 1,010,692 persons of foreign nationality were registered (<a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/migrace/soubor/ctvrtletni-zpravy-o-situaci-v-oblasti-migrace-dokumenty-ctvrtletni-zprava-o-migraci-i-2023.aspx">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;1), and the share of foreigners was therefore 9.3%. For the sake of completeness, let us add that according to later published data, this share reached 9.5% at the end of June (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230914150552/https:/www.czso.cz/csu/czso/obyvatelstvo_lide">at the end of June (<a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/zpravy-o-migraci-ctvrtletni-zprava-o-migraci-ii-2023.aspx">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;1).</p><p>Vít Rakušan does not provide completely accurate figures for 2020 and 2023, especially in the case of the share of foreigners in the total population of the Czech Republic, but he is right that the number of foreigners has roughly doubled.

In the first half of 2023, foreigners were responsible for approximately 10.9% of solved crimes.
