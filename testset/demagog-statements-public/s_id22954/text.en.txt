statement: The draft (budget for next year, note Demagog.cz) of the Ministry of Finance counted on a deficit of 235 billion crowns, it was not a government proposal, but it was a calculation of some parameters, then we determined within the budget framework that the budget deficit for next year must not exceed 270 billion. (...) Finally, we agreed on a deficit of 252 billion for next year.
additional context:
<p>In June 2023, Petr Fiala's government adopted a <a href="https://odok.cz/portal/zvlady/usneseni/2023/449/">resolution</a> (<a href="https://odok.cz/portal/services/download/attachment/2023/449/pdf/">.pdf</a>), by which it approved the Ministry of Finance's preliminary proposal for the amount of state budget revenues and expenditures for 2024. It was not a finished government budget proposal, but only a <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3595254-vlada-schvalila-predbezny-navrh-rozpoctu-na-rok-2024-se-schodkem-235-miliard">preliminary</a> plan, which did not contain a detailed outline of individual components on the revenue and expenditure side. This proposal <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/ministerstvo/media/tiskove-zpravy/2023/vlada-schvalila-predpokladane-parametry-51706">calculated</a> a deficit of 235 billion CZK. Prime Minister Petr Fiala added to the proposal that the final budget deficit would not exceed CZK 270 billion, which the government had already set as the budget deficit ceiling before adopting the resolution. At the end of the href="https://www.odok.cz/portal/veklep/material/KORNCV8KBV8T/">August</a> then the Ministry of Finance <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/ministerstvo/media/tiskove-zpravy/2023/navrh-rozpoctu-na-rok-2024-52808">submitted</a> the final draft budget for 2024 to the government, which includes&nbsp;total revenues of 1&nbsp;921.2&nbsp;billion&nbsp;CZK and&nbsp;expenditures of 2&nbsp;173.2&nbsp;billion&nbsp;CZK. The budget deficit is thus <a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/ekonomika/3611504-ministerstvo-predlozilo-vlade-navrh-rozpoctu-se-schodkem-252-miliard">planned</a> at 252&nbsp;billion.&nbsp;CZK (<a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AuXRjwyZOj5-szj-hbJ8QyXVm69H?e=n9R2tm">.docx</a>, p.&nbsp;1).</p><p>So let's summarize that the Ministry of Finance proposed a state budget deficit for next year of 235&nbsp;billion crowns. It was not actually a&nbsp;government proposal, but only a&nbsp;preliminary plan of the ministry. Even before the approval of this proposal, cabinet representatives stated that the deficit would not exceed 270 billion CZK. The final budget proposal for 2024 then calculates a deficit of 252 billion CZK. We therefore assess the statement as true.</p>
