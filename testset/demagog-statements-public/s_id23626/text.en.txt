statement:At that time, sometime in (…) about 2015, there was an agreement between the opposition and the coalition. At that time, ANO and the Social Democrats were in power, and we (the STAN movement, note: Demagog.cz) were in opposition. And we said: let's set the machine so that when the economy is doing well, the salaries (of politicians, note: Demagog.cz) grow, when the economy is doing badly, the salaries don't grow.

<p>Vít Rakušan (STAN) responds in an interview to a question about the <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/platy-politiku-soudcu-zvyseni-jurecka-navrh-schillerova_2410131347_har">proposal</a> of the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka to increase the salaries of MPs and other constitutional officials. He mentions that politicians should not decide on their salaries. In this context, he adds that, in his opinion, the agreement concluded around 2015 by the then government <a href="https://vlada.gov.cz/cz/media-centrum/dulezite-dokumenty/koalicni-smlouva-mezi-cssd--hnutim-ano-2011-a-kdu-csl-na-volebni-obdobi-2013---2017-115459/">coalition</a> and the opposition, whose aim was to automate the growth of politicians' salaries, should have been respected. According to the Austrian, this agreement was to ensure that salaries would rise in the event of a good economic situation, and would not increase if the economy were to decline.</p><p>The Minister of the Interior is talking about the <a href="https://vlada.gov.cz/cz/media-centrum/dulezite-dokumenty/koalicni-smlouva-mezi-cssd--hnutim-ano-2011-a-kdu-csl-na-volebni-obdobi-2013---2017-115459/">government</a> of Bohuslav Sobotka, when the government coalition consisted of the Social Democrats, ANO and the People's Party. The Mayors and Independents (STAN) and the closely connected Mayors for the Liberecky Region (SLK) were then part of the opposition. In the 2013 elections to the Chamber of Deputies, they specifically <a href="https://www.top09.cz/co-delame/medialni-vystupy/spoluprace-mezi-top-09-a-stan-byla-uspesna-21659.html">ran</a> on the TOP&nbsp;09 candidate list and<a href="https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps111?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xkraj=0&amp;xstrana=0&amp;xv=2&amp;xt=2">won</a> a total of four mandates.

Unlike the <a href="https://www.e-sbirka.cz/sb/1995/236/2013-01-01#par_3-odst_3">previous</a> version, this old-new mechanism determined two <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359">different</a> salary bases, one for judges and&nbsp;the other for other constitutional officials, i.e.&nbsp;MPs, senators&nbsp;etc. Above all, it stipulated that instead of the previous <a href="https://www.e-sbirka.cz/sb/1995/236/2013-01-01#par_3-odst_3">2.75 times</a> the average wage (in the non-business sphere), the salary base of politicians will correspond to <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359">2.25 times</a> the average wage from 2015.</p><p>For the following three years, the amendment <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359">set</a> a gradual increase in the salary base, which in 2018 corresponded to 2.5 times the average wage. For the following years, the <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-359">amendment</a> did not include any further adjustments, which meant that from 2019 the base would return to <a href="https://www.e-sbirka.cz/sb/1995/236/2014-10-01#par_3-odst_3">2.75 times</a> the average wage.

The initial version of the amendment only envisaged a simple freezing of the base at around 52,000 CZK (<a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=110647">.pdf</a>, p.&nbsp;3 of&nbsp;8).</p><p>Other amendments were also in play at the time. The main one was the proposal of the parliamentary budget committee, which also demanded the reintroduction of the automatic system.

They neither supported nor voted against the resulting amendment that reintroduced the automatic mechanism when it was later voted on. It is not clear whether they disagreed with the introduction of the automatic mechanism as such, or with its parameters, which were contained in the promoted proposal by Jan Hamáček.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Although the media published some information about how negotiations on the automatic mechanism for increasing politicians' salaries took place at the turn of 2014 and 2015, based on the available sources, it is impossible to confirm or deny whether representatives of the STAN movement participated in these agreements.
