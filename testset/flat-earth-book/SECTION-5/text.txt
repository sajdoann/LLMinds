SECTION 5.
THE DIAMETER OF THE SUN’S PATH IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING—DIMINISHING FROM DECEMBER 21ST TO JUNE 15TH, AND ENLARGING FROM JUNE TO DECEMBER.

This is a matter of absolute certainty, proved by what is called, in technical language, the northern and southern declination, which is simply saying that the Sun’s path is nearest the north pole in summer, and farthest away from it in winter. This difference in position gives rise to the difference of altitude, as observed at various periods of the year, and which is shewn in the following table, given in “The Illustrated London Almanack,” for 1848, by Mr. Glaisher, of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
