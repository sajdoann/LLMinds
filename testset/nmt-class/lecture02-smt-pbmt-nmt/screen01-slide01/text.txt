 Welcome to the second lecture on statistical machine translation. We have discussed machine translation evaluation techniques last session and we're going to discuss an overview of the approaches to statistical machine translation today. So it will be again a packed lecture but don't be afraid this is an introductory lecture so all the topics or many of the topics that we on here will be then elaborated in the upcoming lecture. So this is to give you a full overview of the task of machine translation and then we will come back to the details again.
