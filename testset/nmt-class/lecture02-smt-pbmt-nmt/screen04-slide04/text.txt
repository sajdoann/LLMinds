 Okay, so I'm not good with history in general, but I have to have a slide on history on machine translation. So that's without years, without any dates. Here is a very, very short summary of the history. So first people tried using a rule-based system, so they were coding what word in what position in the sentence should be translated as what word. That was obviously hard to maintain and in a car, how do you turn the engine on and what errors you're fixing. So you can produce the text, which is actually under the hoods, very structured and formalized. And from this structured and formalized representation, you generate into the many target languages. So it is like a rule-based approach to machine translation already by controlling the source text construction. It's not machine translation in the sense that you would take any input sentence and produce the corresponding output. What worked in the past for this unconstrained scenario was example-based machine translation, which was a follow-up research based on translation memories. So people at translation agencies have used translation memories for many decades now. translation memory is only a database of sentences that you have translated in the past. And whenever a new sentence comes, the system compares or searches the database for the most similar sentences and then offers these as a reminder. And example-based machine translation goes a little bit further. It tries to use these identified examples and replace things which are easy to replace there. So for example, if there is a sentence which was translated already and it differs from the current input in the date, it's very easy to create the translation of the new sentence. So that's the idea of example-based machine translation. And then there are approaches to statistical machine translation. And it started with word-level translation and then the units got larger. So phrase-based machine translation, which we'll briefly summarize today. And then syntax-based machine translation, where the units are linguistically motivated. And then neural MT. So I would just like to highlight one more difference between the example-based and statistical. In example-based, you take the longest units that you have from humans and you modify a bit of those long units. In statistical machine translation, before neural approach, you decompose everything into much smaller units. And then you were reconstructing the sentence from these smaller pieces. So that's some difference which also affected me. ... ... ... ... ...
