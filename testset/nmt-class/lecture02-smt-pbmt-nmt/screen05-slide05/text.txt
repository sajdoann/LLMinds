 performance and domain specificity of those systems. So some important people from the history, just a handful of them. Warren Weaver was the first one to introduce this statistical approach and back that was after the war the idea was to approach machine translation as a deciphering problem. So the deciphering problem has been heavily studied during the World War and now that was reused. So the idea is that someone was actually thinking English and it just happened that this message got coded in his mouth and so, maybe coded on purpose or maybe coded by noise and in the end the words that came out of the mouth of that person were in Russian. So the idea is that this the original English in the head of the person needs to be just stripped of the code or the noise has to be removed and from this now Russian text we remove the code and get the English which is behind the scene. So that's the idea of Warren Weaver and that's where probabilities were introduced to the field. Then Noam Chomsky, a famous linguist, said that the notion of probability of a sentence is totally useless, is ill-defined, there is no way to define this notion of probability of a sentence in a way so that it makes sense and we'll see that there are some reasons to agree with this but still without even without this proper grounding of the term we can get very far away with the probability of the sentence. The idea is probably based on the rejection of probability of a sentence as an idea that comes from the fact like if you put all the sentences of a language together then which one is the most probable, that makes no sense at all. Given some communication situation you immediately know which of the sentences are more probable but without that that doesn't make any sense and by the way the number of sentences in language is infinite so that we already have a little technical problem with that. Then the practical people, I would like to mention Frederick Jelinek or Jelinek or he was a Czech guy and in the 80s he worked for IBM and there he set up the machine translation system of IBM and then later he worked at John Hopkins University and he also had very strong links to our department so he helped us in many ways in the past with our Therefore, the engineers focus on the majority of cases. And they don't care about exceptions. And if they cover a large portion, if they get 90% of accuracy, then obviously the users are the most happy they can be. Linguists are interested in those exceptions. So if you have someone in your team who is constantly bringing exceptions into the consideration and who is distracting you with these exceptions, then you can focus badly. and you may forget or you are not paying attention to the majority of cases. So yes, linguists can be distracting, but still they will warn you about things that like you are hiding under the carpet. And if you are hiding something which is critically important for the general performance, then this will fire back to you sooner or later anyway. So it's good to talk to linguists. So what I like best is the approach of and he likes equations. So he even used equations to define what MT is. MT is linguistic modeling and statistical decision theory. So there is, you clearly see that these two fields should work in a unified way and not fight against each other. I think they really see the two find Š Millnobikbooks have a Deutsche Startup. And that is, DOSРU щ is the most important part. But theyear Schedule is not about expanding Collection points to refine each other. Currently, we think RUBIC Nora is a long verg pobre to decide that we are solely available by the worldwide unit in a unified way. The BAR32 we succeed is to define yourself with TRU trade challenges and a percentage between each other. Okay. I think RUBICalet. I think RUBICalet. What do you think RUBIC vamos up for more and more diverse? No, but that petits points to design in first-second line or can the IBZF há more.
