 What makes MT statistical? And now the ultimate goal of traditional statistical machine translation, so traditional means before new MT, the quest was to find minimum translation units so that they are frequent across many sentence pairs, so that you can reuse information across sentence pairs, and so that these units are easy to process, like, because you don't have to reorder and so on. And ideally, these units should be discoverable automatically from the given data. And the data are of two types. You have very large collections of monolingual texts, and you have smaller collections of parallel texts where people already translated these sentences. And optionally, you can use any automatic linguistic analysis on these data if that helps you in finding the units and finding the important points where the system should look at. a lot And O Your idea o
