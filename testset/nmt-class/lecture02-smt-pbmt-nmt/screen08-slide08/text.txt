 Okay, so now the probability. How do we divide the probability? Let's define the task of statistical machine translation. We have a source sentence in a foreign language, so F1 till Fj. That's the sequence of words. And we are expected to produce a target language, E1 till Ei, because they can have different lengths. The F and I come from English and French. That was the original language pair studied. But we will use it regardless of the source and target languages. And here is the critical formula that everybody has to remember and understand. It's pretty easy. Somehow we will define the probability of the target sentence given the source. And then when we have this probability defined, we are searching for such a target sentence which maximizes this probability. And this is the particular sentence that we will Is it? Or takim on theè©² shoulder sentiment Boss That would be more such sentences. More sentences can have the same probability. In that case we will emit one of those. So the argmax does not deal with ambiguity much. So now the question is how do we define this probability, this conditional probability of the target sentences given the source sentences?
