 And that is where the systems differ, obviously. So here is an example. This is a brute force machine translation. It is based on the translation memories approach. And the idea is that we have a list of translated sentences and we will define the probability to be one if we have seen this pair in our collection. And we will set it to zero if we have not seen it. deprivation or not, that is the reality here. So podr It's not a probability, yes. So what is the technical problem here? Some sentence translated to multiple. Exactly. And that's what happens here. So this how are you has two translations. And depending on what is your source and what is your target, it can easily happen that this probability would sum to more than one. So you don't want a probability to sum to more than one.
