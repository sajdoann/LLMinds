 These are the two problems. So in order to make it a probability so that it sums to one, you need to normalize. So you use the counts of sentence occurrences. That will already give you some numbers that are between zero and one. That's useful. And the more important problem that you've mentioned, this only zeros and ones, is that this probability distribution is not smooth enough. And smooth enough means that it doesn't generalize Also, if you ask for a sentence pair which is listed in the table, you will get a very high probability. And if you ask for just a slightly changed sentence, then suddenly you are at zero. So there is like a jump in the probability distribution. So good morning is dobre r√°no and that gives you the conditional probability of one, given this small database. And good evening is pretty close. to produce at least half of the output and the user will be half happy. But you don't have anything in your output, in your table, so the probability will be zero, regardless of what target sentence you consider. So that's the problem.
