 of the definition. So what do we do with that? So remember in our formula we are searching for the highest scoring, the most probable target sentence given the source. So we have this conditional probability. What can we do if we have a formula and there is conditional probability? Well, if you are a statistician and you see conditional probability anywhere you will apply Bayes' law. So that's I think the idea where it came from. a formula. It's non-decomposable. You don't know what to do with that. Well, Bayes' law at least applies, allows you to break it into two parts. So let's do it. So you simply use Bayes' law to rewrite this conditional probability as the reversed one. And then while doing so, there is also the probabilities of the source sentence alone and of the target sentence alone. So this is simply the application of the Bayes' law. And then you have to realize that in this formula, this formula is not used as like not just the fraction. You are using this fraction within the argmax. So what does the argmax do? The argmax searches for the particular target sentence which gets the highest result of this calculation. And all elements in this comparison are divided by the same number, the probability of the source sentence. So regardless of the source sentence, what the probability of a sentence is will be the same. And if you have a set of elements and all of them are divided by the same number, you can find the highest scoring element even without actually dividing it by the number. So you can just ignore the probability of that constant. Okay, so that's it. That's the simplification. So the Bayes' law allowed us to decompose this probability First class, we could see the probability of the target sentence given the source into two separate probabilities, Probability of the source given the target. That is somewhat strange, but it's talking about the same aspect. The relation between the source and target languages. The source and target variants of the sentence. And then a new element is that the probability of the target sentence
