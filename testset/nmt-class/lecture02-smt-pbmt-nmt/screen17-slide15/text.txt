 And the way to handle this is to... There are many methods of smoothing. So one of the simple ones is simply backing off to shorter n-grams. So in the end you will define the probability of the whole sentence as a product of three different models. One is the trigram probability, another one is the bigram probability where there is a lower chance of having some n-gram zero. now with this backoff approach will be zero. So actually this is not a backoff, this is interpolation if you use all the considerations at the same time. If you use backoff the idea is that if the trigram is known you will not consider the bigrams and you resort to bigrams only if the trigram is not known. In interpolation you use all these models at the same time so the results vary. Sometimes interpolation is better, sometimes especially if all tension弄 Д8s each three times A5s backoff was better.
