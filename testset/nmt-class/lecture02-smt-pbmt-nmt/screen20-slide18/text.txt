 is that, well, we always use this formula within the argmax. And this constant, this summation of all the points that we have distributed is identical across all these sentences. So we don't need to calculate that sum at all. So because we are using this fraction within the argmax, we don't have to bother about summing. So we only have to distribute points to define feature points.
