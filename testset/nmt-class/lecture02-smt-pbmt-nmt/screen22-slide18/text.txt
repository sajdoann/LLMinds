 Okay, so to summarize, the Logliner model uses the idea of feature functions to score candidates' translations from different aspects. Each of these feature functions is associated with a weight, and that weight will tell you how important the feature function is. To make it a proper probability, you would have to go over all sentence pairs and see how many points you have distributed those. But because we are only searching for the high-scoring candidate, we do not have to normalize at all. So that's the final Logliner model.
