 get the balance right. Okay, so there is something wrong with this formula. We have used the base law, the noisy channel approach, and already the base law, the separation of the language model from the translation model, causes the problem that the language model is likely to prefer shorter sentences, so sentences without negation, and it doesn't consider the source anymore, so that's already one problem. apartment, and the other problem is the decomposition into the phrases which allowed us to propose these wrong outputs. The the main problem is already here, the base decomposition as soon as you have something which disregards the source, it can easily break your translation units.
