 identified weights. These weights are indicating the positions and slopes of the lines. And then there is some non-linear function which is part of the computation. And there is some fine weights also for the fine neuron. And that's it. So in order to separate points in the center from points on the circular it is sufficient to have three, six, nine, twelve, thirteen numbers. If you are able to find thirteen real numbers then given your training data then this system can train automatically. So you need thirteen numbers and this architecture of the computation to separate that.
