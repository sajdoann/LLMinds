 If you use perfect coordinates, if you use perfect inputs, which could be x1 squared and x2 squared, you do not need any hidden layer at all. Because the formula for the circle is x squared plus y squared equals 1, or x1 squared plus x2 squared minus 1 is less than 0. So this is an exact calculation of the points in the center versus the points on the circumference.
