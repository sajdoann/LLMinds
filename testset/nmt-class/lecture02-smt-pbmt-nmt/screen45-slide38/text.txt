 If you have unfortunate features, the X and Y coordinates, there is no way to linearly combine them to separate the center from the circumference. So all what neural networks do is just linear separation. But they first change the coordinates in some way. If your coordinates are unfortunate and you use them directly, there is no way you can linearly separate that. We have seen the lucky case where we use the
