 The bigger problem is that there is no relation between words. This is again not smooth representation. That's the issue. So if you are considering whether the next output word should be the zebra or sleeping or question mark, then all these words are like on the same level. They are not different from each other. So if you are considering then that's like much more easier or much more sensible question to ask than the and zebra or whatever. So the relation between words is something which is not captured in this one-hot representation. This is called one-hot representation and words are either identical, so you have a cat and you have a cat and that's the identical word, or you have a cat and then you have a dog and that's distinct, but that's identically distinct as the cat is distinct from a willow or from a big goss. So that's a bad property if you, like, a kitten and a big goss are equally, like, similar candidates if you cannot come up with a cat. So if you're searching for a replacement for a cat and you are considering kitten versus because, and they seem equally good candidates, there is something wrong with the representation. So So
