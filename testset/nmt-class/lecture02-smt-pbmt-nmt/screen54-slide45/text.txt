 If the sub-word is for incantus veze, s to English translated would be quid. Well, this is a different s. So it's s and this extra symbol. So this is indeed distinct, but there is another problem. This migranti was automatically decomposed into mi and granti. So that's grants and not migrants. And here, yes, there is a new ambiguity. So in the source, the source is always ambiguous. There are many words that have more meanings and the system has to identify what is the possible meaning of that word and it decides based on the other words in the sentence. So here, if it sees granti alone, it will translate it as grants. And if it sees me and this joining mark and then granti, it will know already it should use the word migrants. So it uses the context to disambiguate. The support units only increase the ambiguity of the source.
