 So we also need to handle the variable length input. And when we were discussing the basics of neural networks, we had a fixed number of inputs. So the idea how to digest a variable length input is to use the same matrix, same operation calculation to one unit at a time and consume the input sensor. sisters, an intentional sentence into some sentence level representation, and then again, produce the longer output from that representation. So, the same trained transformation is used every time at the input, and you need some tricks to be able to train it, because the network then suddenly becomes much deeper. So the same parameters are trained in multiple steps, we'll come to the details But essentially there is too long path from the inputs to the outputs. And when training there is a problem of vanishing gradients. So you need to use some particular basic units of neural network to avoid the...
