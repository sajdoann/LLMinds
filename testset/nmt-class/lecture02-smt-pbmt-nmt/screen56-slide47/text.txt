 Numerical issues. So the first time neural networks were successfully used in machine translation was when they were, when Kyun Kun Cho scored phrases in the phrase-based system. So there was a standard phrase-based system and that has this feature which scores how well a short sequence of words corresponds to a short sequence of the target words. But these phrases are of varying length, the number of of words in these phrases varies. So this is where he first used the encoder-decoder architecture. So an encoder consumed the source words in the phrase and the decoder produced or looked at the target phrase and checked if it's a likely translation. So this was a new scoring for an old component in the original phrase-based pipeline. And that helped a lot.
