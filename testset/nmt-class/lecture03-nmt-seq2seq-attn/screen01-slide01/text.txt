 So good morning again. Welcome to the third lecture on statistical machine translation. And today we'll focus on the basics of NeuralMT. We have had some of that already in the overview lecture previous, as a previous session. Today we are going to cover the basic sequence to sequence architecture and we're also going to add the attention to that. is not the current state of the art of NeuralMT. So expect after some series of lectures on the more traditional approach, expect also the details about the transformer.
