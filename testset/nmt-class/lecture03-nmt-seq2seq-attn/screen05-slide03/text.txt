 In the lecture you will see how some words get in, but how is this related to the meaning of the sentence? That is something that no one should ask me. So it somehow handles the meaning of the sentence automatically just by observing parallel data. So there is no direct link between the architecture, the maths underneath and any of the linguistics.
