 So here is again an example of what a four layer network can do with the coordinate system. So we have two coordinates x and y as the input and we are always given a point and we need to say the color of the point. So we need to linearly separate between all the points in x and y plane. One half of the points should be red and one half should be blue. The problem is in the other half of the screen. And we don't know how to do this transformation exactly by ourselves, but we can simply ask the neural network to train itself. So all that we do is that we specify that we want to have four layers, four of the network, so the previous structure of computation. So there will be four weight matrices, each transforming two input coordinates into two input coordinates. I'm not pretty sure, have a look at the block. And then at the end we definitely go to two coordinates at the output and there is also a bus vector at each of these layers. We initialize the weights randomly and then we let it train. So this is how the training gradually progresses, how it's getting better and better at separating these two sets of points. So originally the set of points on the part of the spiral were like in that area and they were entangled with the blue spiral. But as the coordinates are changing, as the weights are getting updated, the original space gets like squashed and pulled and torn and so on. And after a sequence of these updates, there is a way how to draw a line that linearly separates the red points, and the blue points. It is important to realize that there are also many other points on the X and Y input plane, but no one is going to ask what is the color of this other point or this other point. We are always going to be asked about the points around the training examples. So the training examples are the many points on these two spirals and the test examples will also come from this similar position. If you ask about the color of this of this point, then there is no intuition what the answer should be and second the network has no evidence what to put there. So this kind of illustrates the capability of neural networks to interpolate. So if we ask about points close or between points that we know, it will be easy for the network to classify them correctly.
