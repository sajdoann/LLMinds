 We have already seen this slide. This is the very simple way of representing the input sentence. The input sentence is the cat is on the mat and we will represent this sentence as a matrix with columnar vectors. Each of these vectors will have zeros everywhere except for a single one and the one will be at that position in the vector which corresponds to the position in the dictionary. so we have all English words assigned to the individual coordinates elements of the vector and there is the technical problem that in English it is vector of length 1 million and in Czech it would be vector of length 2 million or more. So that is that is impossible to process. So what do we do?
