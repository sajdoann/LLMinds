 Let the network update its choice or like let during the decoding let the network start the outputs with something which is not necessarily the best scoring individual words but in the end it pays off. So the beam search is one of the other approaches. here the network here you run the network in a way which allows to produce also less likely beginnings of the sentences, less likely words and then benefit and get to the highly probable final sentence later in later stages. In the greedy decoding the network will prefer two common words to one uncommon and then something which recovers the
