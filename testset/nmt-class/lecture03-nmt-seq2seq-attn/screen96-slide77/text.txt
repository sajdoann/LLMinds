 Needless to say they do not match the attentions, do not match the alignments. So here is the word alignment with the blue squares and you see that the attentions actually peak one word after that. And that is totally possible. So the encoder is free to like show the most important information once the second step after the word. So it does happen very often that the attentions cannot be interpreted as word alignment because the attentions are kind of alignments between the state of the encoder and state of the decoder and not between the words. Yeah, that's a big difference that you should keep.
