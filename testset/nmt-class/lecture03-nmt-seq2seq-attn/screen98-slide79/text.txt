 It is very flexible and clever. It is also successful in image captioning. So if you have an attentive image captioner, it is producing a caption description of the image and the attention over the image is now not like the unit. It's the attention is now two dimensional not just one dimensional thing and here the network learns to attend to parts of the the pictures. So when it is producing the word dog, it is mostly attending to the area of the image where the dog is present and if it's talking about trees and there was a giraffe, it is actually considering everything in the picture but the area of the giraffe and so on.
