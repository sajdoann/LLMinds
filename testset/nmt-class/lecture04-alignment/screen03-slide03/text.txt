 So, first, a little bit of motivation. Why do we need the word alignment or why did we need it for the previous state of the art? So the previous state of the art was phrase-based machine translation and there you started with some parallel corpus that was previously translated by humans and you needed to extract some clever type of dictionary that contained all the phrases and their translations. And these phrases were extracted so that they are consistent with the word alignment. So the dictionary of phrases was constructed on the basis of knowing which words in one language correspond to which words in the other language. So this is the word alignment. These word alignments need not be always one to one. So sometimes they are one to one like this faster and rychle or the full stop at the end of the sentences. But sometimes these word alignments translate more words at once. So this Czech word nyn√≠ can be translated as this time around. and if you know these word alignments, you can extract phrases and then you can use these phrases to cover input sentences. And that's the way to proceed with the standard classical statistical machine translation. But how do we get these alignment points for the individual words? And that's the topic of the lecture today.
