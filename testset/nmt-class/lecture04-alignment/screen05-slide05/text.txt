 about discussing the data that we have had for our language pair of interest that is Czech and English and we have already quite some history of data gathering for this language pair so I'll briefly summarize the history and the effects of the data on the translation quality. So in one of the very early releases of that corpus, CENG 0.7, we were able to find and include the sources of texts. So it was legal texts which was the European Union and back then the Czech Republic was part of the European Union only for a couple of years so that was not too big of a collection and then there were other documents except aside from the the corpus that the Union has already collected. Then we were able to get hold of some stories or news commentaries so Reader's Digest stories or some books from the project Gutenberg or Palmknihy back then so some e-book which were available and then also this project syndicate which is news commentaries this project still exists and it's volunteers journalists who publish their essays and they translate it in very high quality to many languages. So these were the stories and commentaries and then we also were seeking for some user supplied data and this the user supplied data that we were able to find were primarily translations or localizations of open source projects or desktop environments like KDE or GNOME. So these are not full sentences these were mainly labels of many items and so on but it's it is still some vocabulary which which can be useful. And then there was some commercial translation company that decided to translate the English Wikipedia into Czech and ask users to correct these translations and that was called the Davaho project. This project is now dead because the translations were not as good as expected and the users didn't provide too many translations but in the early stages some reasonable amount of sentence level corrections of manual of machine outputs were gathered. So that's... knead for age,aben to make sense we've seen these to the needed predictions too many going on which are operating powers
