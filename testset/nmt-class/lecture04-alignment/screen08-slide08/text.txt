 The community supply data, if it's not anonymous, if it's people who sign in into the system, then it's suddenly of perfect quality. So the KDE and GNOME localizations, the people contributing under their own name, really try hard. They may be using some nicknames, but still they are part of the community, so they do want to have a good impression on the community. self relationship level, super stoic. There is obviously no vandalism and the quality is almost professional. So this is, this is a very good source, but the domain is different. It's only very short very short segments.
