 The thing that we noticed though when we were collecting this data was that there are many more texts available that already have translations in the internet. Just the licensing conditions are not quite clear. So the bolded lines, the professional translations and the community translations are what we included in that release of Cheng back then. And you see that it is about 21 or 22 million tokens but another 28 million tokens could be obtained if we used community translations of proprietary texts and if we use other proprietary translations that we just found somewhere but that had no indication of the license. So you see that the available data is much larger than what is labelled for reuse and for explicitly marked that it can be used for training of machine translation systems. This is just a call to action to everybody who is gathering any data. The situation has changed a lot in the last 10 years. So people are now quite used to labelling the licenses for the data. But please do so and please use permissive licenses. If you do not the data is not available for good purposes because there is just legal uncertainty. The Czech authorship law is good in this respect because it allows us to use all the data for research and non-commercial purposes. And that's something that we have been relying on for the past years.
