 So now let's talk about the effect that the training data has on translation quality. So this is the total data that we had in 2008. We have discussed this in-domain and professional translation. So that is the legal text that we had and the stories. Then there is some out-of-domain professional translation. Then we have the community supplied data with proper copyright labeling. that's very small as you see. So this is the remark I've made a second ago that people were not used to label their data with copyright text. And then we have this unclear status of the data. It's community supplied but it's not labeled. It's based on some proprietary text. Probably you may be asking what is this large data source. The community the translations and the original texts are of proprietary status. Obviously it's subtitles. So if you are watching a movie you are legally allowed to watch the movie and enjoy it. But you actually should not be taking notes and you should not be translating the content of the movie unless you have the permission of the company that created the movie. So this is pretty annoying. All the subtitles that were created by listening to the movies and writing down the source and translating it to the many target languages. All these subtitles stand in like shaky legal position. But everybody uses these subtitles. Everybody relies on them. And in the Czech Republic for the research and non-commercial purposes it's actually good to go. So in the following I'll show the effect.
