 And we have two more plots here. One is when we include professional translation and when we use all the professional translations that we have. And here we have all the community translations. You see that the community translations are maybe even more out of domain for this out of domain dataset or they are not nice and fluent sentences. So the BLEU scores are somewhat higher for the professional translations, Defence! The freebrade is about the same.
