 So here is the timeline of Cheng over the now 14 years of development actually and this year is 2020 we have released the version 2.0 and this version 2.0 is already getting pretty large we rely on genuine parallel text that's about 61 million sentence pairs or more than a half a giga word in Cheng and English and then we also use a large collection of synthetic text so that is text which originates in one of the languages only and we machine translated it with our 2018 system which performs comparably to humans according to some estimates so we trust the quality of these translations quite a bit and so that is a little bit more than 2 giga words per language of synthetic text so if you want to of words to show off with some numbers you can say that Cheng 2.0 has 5 giga words of words Czech English combined. So here is the history and you see that we have been gradually growing the corpus and then also regularly shrinking it with some filtering because that's an important part of the exercise to remove badly translated sentences or misaligned sentences. So this is what we have been doing so the previous release was 1.7 that was filtering of the previously released setup and also I would like to highlight that this version 1.6 included that still included the heavy linguistic annotation automatically processing we were providing syntactic trees shallow syntax and deep syntax and also word alignments and the alignments of content words at the text or grammatical layer. the actual language is actually quite heavy to do all these analysis for all the text so that's why we don't provide it and these days there's not so strong interest in linguistic annotations. It will come back but not this year.
