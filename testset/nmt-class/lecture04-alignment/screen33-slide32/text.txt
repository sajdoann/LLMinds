 And still it's relevant technique. So the lexical translation, what does it entail? The lexical translation is what you will find in dictionary. So if you want to know how to translate the word, you will open the dictionary and you will see that the word has multiple translations. So if you are translating the German word house into English, in your dictionary you can easily find that it can be translated as house or building or home or household or shell for So we see that there are many different translations and if we are human users of the dictionary, we need to somehow decide which of the translations is good. So what we normally do using paper dictionaries is that we search back, like look up what shell is in German and then we will say oh well that this shell is like for snails and other creatures, it's not like for humans. So it's probably not the right word if I want to translate that I bought a new house. So this back translation with the help of the dictionary is something what people can use because the dictionaries normally lack another important information. Some of these translations are more probable in the given type of text and some are very unprobable. So if we had some probability scoring for these, it would be easier to decide. We would simply pick the highest scoring, the most probable translation of a word. Yeah. So let's talk about obtaining these lexical translation probabilities. So that means for each word, all the possible target language words associated with the likelihood, the chance of
