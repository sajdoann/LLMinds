 That's where the EM algorithm comes in. It is exactly designed for that. If we had complete data, we would estimate the model. If we had the model, we could fill in the gaps in the data. And you do this loop of expectation algorithm. You initialize the model parameters some way, in some way, randomly or uniformly. And you improve your data with the current bad model. That creates some new version of the data. You use this new version of the data to extract a new model and then you repeat. So you use this improved model parameters to complete the data and so on. So initialize uniformly, assign probabilities to the missing data, estimate the model parameters from the completed data and iterate because you have now a better version of the model. So let's...
