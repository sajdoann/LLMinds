 For a little while, then again the alignments for the good words, for the matching words will get stronger and the alignments for the non-matching words get less important or less probable. And words that are not covered in other sentences at all, such as this flower here, they will get aligned to each other simply because the probability mass has to be distributed somewhere the la is already being occupied by the so the flower is likely to choose the flare. So this is the pigeonhole principle. You have to put the pigeons are coming to their house, then if there are more pigeons than holes, there must be a hole through which two pigeons go. So that is by the full coverage of the words. It's guaranteed that the word flower will eventually get aligned to flare and that the probability mass that was acquired by the and la will like keep the pair the and la separate from the flare.
