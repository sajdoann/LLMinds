 The next step that happens here is a trick that swaps the sums and the products. And this will be another exercise for homework to realize that you can do this swap of sum and product simply by factoring out elements that appear in more like that appear several times in that calculation. So this is just an algebraic manipulation with the formula. so that in the end we arrive at knowing that the probability of the target sentence given the source can be estimated by multiplying over all the target positions the summation over all the source words that the target can be mapped to considering their lexical probabilities.
