 This is the way the IBM Modals, or IBM Model 4, proceeded when it was used for translation, but that's exactly what it is being used for in word alignment these days. So the idea of IBM Model 4 is that you have some source sentence. This source sentence is first processed with the Fertility Model that for some words says they don't have any translation, for some words it's like prepare slots, so the probability of slap having a three word translation in Spanish is very likely, so the model will prepare three slots for that. Then there is the probability of introducing words that have no counterpart in the source sentence. Then we have the lexical translations. Here we see that Mary is most likely translated to Maria. The particle is strange thing here is that we use the the same entry in the lexical translation probability for translating these three versions of slap. So this slap should be translated as Daba, Una, Bofetada step by step and it will be only the language model which will then suggest these words in their order because here the lexical probabilities are based on the same part of the table. And then finally there is some distortion model which allows the words to be further reordered. from the same случæ of whatever it is, the number it is created are based on the same context here more or the same, we can release it as a longer term. So I've got two things now, assume you repeat the time for the time." But this is just one� now. And this does not mean the answer, this is the question of what I asked what I said was on when the standardized control system is each to get used in a favor. And this is the one of the jour or the reason it won't do so is that how it is important, where I asked if it all may not be discussed?
