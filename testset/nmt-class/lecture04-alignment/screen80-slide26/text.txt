 So the reason why we have some uncertainty in aligning has been also considered by other colleagues and they did it for Chinese and English and they observed that these possible or or strange alignments between English and Chinese are essentially of two types in some it's 96% of alignment points. for the English definition article. There is no counterpart. So asking to put the alignment point here is a bad question in the first place. And here is the other situation where it happens. So it's a role equivalent pairs that are not lexical equivalent. So if something was discovered in English, in Chinese there is the content word to discover and there is some passive marker. But it's not a lexical translation of the word to be in English past. So that's why it may seem superficially from the data that this like aligns well, the was with the passive marker. But it's something that you would never put into a dictionary that was is translated as a passive marker. So the meaning of was is passive marker. So this is why people would like have problems putting the alignment point here.
