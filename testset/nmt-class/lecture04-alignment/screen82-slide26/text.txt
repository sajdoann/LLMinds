 What is the theory that led to this? It's the tectogrammatic layer. The tectogrammatic layer is something which is well covered in many courses in Prague's Combination Linguistics Studies. And the very essential idea is that you draw three or four sentences and only content-bearing words have a note and auxiliary words are hidden in this deep syntactic representation. representation in this tectogrammatic representation. So if you take the sentence that was on the previous slide, nemyslím, že by se tojich zákazníků moc líbilo, I don't think their customers would like it very much. The auxiliaries are marked in red here and they are hidden as node attributes only within these trees. So if you observe these trees, you can see that they are like similar. It's easier to align the nodes in the trees because they correspond to each other.%ŚŌŋŌŋŌŋŋŌŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋŋ
