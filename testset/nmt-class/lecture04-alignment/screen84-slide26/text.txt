 There is a related approach which is unsupervised and it's called LEAF. The idea here is that you distinguish explicitly in the modal which of the words are content-bearing or headwords and which of these words are auxiliaries, the non-headwords. And the modal has then the capacity to link only headwords across the languages and the non-headwords are always attached within the given language. So that's exactly RIS, the same assumption that lies behind the the techo-chromantic layer where the auxiliaries are specific to a given language and you attach the auxiliaries within the language to their headwords. And then you only uh align these headwords across the languages. And, obviously, you can also delete some some headwords and and like introduce uh insert some some headwords. So this is something which is linguistically more adequate it has never quite caught up. So it would be still interesting to revive this. this approach and with the new machine learning methods I'm sure that it would perform better.
