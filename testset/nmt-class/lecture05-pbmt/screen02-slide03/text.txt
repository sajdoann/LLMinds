 Here is an overview of the talk. We'll first start with just one slide summary of phrase-based MT. And I'll have to remind you of the log-linear model, which is the mathematical basis or statistical basis of that system. And then we'll describe the phrase-based machine translation model as such. So we'll describe the features which are used in this log-linear model. And we'll talk about how to obtain them and and how to use them to score phrases. And an important part of the lecture will be devoted to the so-called decoding, so translation with the model. Once you have everything ready, once you have the translation tables, the automatically extracted translation dictionaries, how do you translate a given input sentence? And the last bit is devoted to something which is the actual training in the current or in the proper machine learning terms. And that's the the weight optimization, the minimum error rate training. So let's
