 So what goes along with the phrase-based machine translation approach is this so-called phrase-based empty pipeline. And the pipeline is the sequence of steps that you need to do if you want to build your own phrase-based machine translation system. So something which was called the training of the phrase-based translation system had these steps. First you had to find parallel texts, then you have to align them at the level of documents and sentences and then at the level of words. So this is something that we have covered in quite some detail in the previous lecture. And then you extracted the translation units with their scores. So this is what I have briefly hinted at the beginning and I'll again repeat in a second. So there you end up with the phrase tables or probability tables that give you the basic translation units and their some data, so just some aggregate observation of the data. And the actual training of the model is the estimation which of these parameters are more important and which are less important. And then the inference in the machine learning sense that is the actual translation and there you take the input sentence, you break it into known units, those that are listed in your translation dictionary in your phrase table and you
