 So now the now how to estimate the probabilities of the most important feature of phrase based machine translation. So that's the feature which considers the translation of the individual phrases and as I hinted in the previous lectures already we simply use maximum likelihood estimate we see how often the given source and phrases co-occurred together. That's the count of their co-occurrences and we divide that we normalize that by the antecedent in the by the count of the observations of the antecedent. So by the count of the source phrase for example if we are doing this this probability this direction when we're predicting the target given the source. In practice both directions are used and we have discussed that in the previous so you do actually divide this count of the co-occurrences once you divide it with the count of the source phrase alone and in the second calculation which gives you another feature you divide it by the count of target phrases alone. So that is a very simple and these counts where do these counts come from.
