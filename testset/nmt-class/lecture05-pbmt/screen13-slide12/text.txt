 So we're moving to the translation. How do we translate with the phrase-based system? The translation has two phases. In the first phase you only consider, you like search your phrase table and you consider which phrases are applicable for this sentence. And then with this limited like restricted database you do the search, you try to combine the puzzle pieces. in the same way. So for the puzzle piece analogy. The first one is given the whole bag of all possible puzzle pieces, we select the ones which could cover the input sentence. And in the decoding we are playing around with the combinations of the puzzle pieces and we're sub-selecting, we're selecting the final small set that we will use to cover the sentence and also to put them in some particle order.
