 And we keep on this expansion of hypothesis. So now the most promising one is the he based on current estimate of the weights. And we go further and we expand this he with the translation of the third word, ja, which can be translated as yes. He, yes, that doesn't seem as a nice sequence. So maybe this path is not worth exploring. Then he goes and that looks pretty good or and there was the translation of the get or we can translate this ja nicht as does not. So that would be he does not. And then again, we can continue by adding further words. For example, the go filling the gap in the coverage vector and then finally translating this last these last two words nach Hause into home. So then after we do all these considerations and all the all the possible orderings of phrases, we arrive at the hypothesis, which covers the whole covers the whole output and the whole input. And it if we backtrack it.
