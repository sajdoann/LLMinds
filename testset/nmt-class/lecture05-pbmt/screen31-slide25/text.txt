 So here is the summary in the studio code. You place empty hypothesis into stack 0 and then you travel across all the stacks in a for loop, so linearly. And for all hypotheses in the stack you consider all the translation options and because there is fixed number of translation options a limit of those as well then this can be deemed constant. And then if the translation option fits, if it's compatible with the vector then you create a new hypothesis and you place it to the appropriate for the stack possibly recombining it and then if the stack has grown too big then you can directly prune it and you proceed. So after you have covered all the hypotheses or expanded all the hypotheses from the current stack you move to the next stack. At the end your final stack contains only hypotheses that cover all the words and at the top of the stack
