 So to estimate the future cost, we will consider only the cost of the translation of the words. So phrase translation probabilities. For language model, we will consider only the production of the output phrases within the puzzle pieces and not on their boundaries. And for reordering model, we just ignore that in the future cost. so the future cost is an optimistic estimate of how much we will have to pay in the for each of the individual feature functions as we proceed with with the translation. And it's optimistic because we are ignoring the reordering cost and we are ignoring the n-grams at the boundaries of phrases. And it's good that it's optimistic, heuristics have to be optimistic for the A star search
