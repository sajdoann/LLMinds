 So how do we estimate the future cost? This is something that can be pre-computed. So we know we have the translation options table. So we have all the puzzle pieces that translate individual parts of the source sentence. And we can only summarize this puzzle pieces, these translation options to see how expensive are they, what is the cheapest way of the individual words, the cheapest way of translating word pairs, the cheapest way of translating triples of words and so on. So this is a dynamic programming style algorithm. You fill up a diagonal or a triangular table that will tell you for a given span in the sentence what is the cheapest cause that you will have to pay for sure when you are translating this part of the sentence.
