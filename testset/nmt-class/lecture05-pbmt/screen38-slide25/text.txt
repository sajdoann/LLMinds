 When you are comparing the two hypotheses that we had at the beginning, one of the hypotheses translated the easy words first. So the first time was the candidate translation. So it picked up the easy words at the end of the sentence. And now it is receiving also the future cost score and the future cost estimation that is this minus 9.3. that will be have to pay anyway to translate the first six words in the sentence. So if we consider the score of the price paid so far which is minus 4.11 with the future cost 9.3 we get the total cost 13.41. If we compare that score with the score of the hypothesis that translates the hard word first, So its score on its own is minus 5.88 but there is a low future cost estimate because the easy words will still be paid for and it will be a lower price. The total score will be 6 plus 5.88 that's 11.98. So the total estimate of the full path once we finish is now better for the which started with the hard words first. So now this comparison between the two hypotheses is fairer and the system has not the tendency of translating the easy words first and then just covering the rest the hard words randomly at the end because it is like stuck in a dead-end road. So the future cost estimate is there to avoid these dead-end roads. It is to that paying first the higher price is okay if you're doing it for like a good investment you are translating the hard phrases. Later the path will be smoother and easier for you and that's what the future cost estimate.
