 Skip this and let's go back to my slides. So we have already talked about the scores a bit and we have talked about the recombination of hypothesis. And here I would like to highlight the difference between feature functions. We've already discussed in the one in one of the previous lectures that some of these feature functions are used for the of the current candidate and some of these feature functions are used for scoring of the current candidate. And there is one more important distinction and the other important distinction is whether the feature functions are local or non-local. So the general idea of phrase based machine translation is that you translate by pieces. So you have the whole input and there is some decomposition happening. So these puzzle pieces in our case in phrase based translation are the phrases that always cover some words small number of consecutive words in the input. And you use these puzzle pieces to cover the input. Some of the scoring functions then consider the output in a way which is in line with the segmentation. That's the local features. And some of the scoring functions also like properties across boundaries of these puzzle pieces. And that is the non-local feature functions. So to illustrate it here the local feature functions are those in the red rectangles. So the red rectangles are the puzzle pieces. These are the building blocks that segment the input sentence. The input sentence was Peter left for home. And we have we have searched the parallel corpus. We have done our word alignments and extracted all phrases consistent with alignment and all that. So we know that Peter can be translated as Peter. Left for the two words thing can be translated as a single word odeschele. And Domu can be translated or Home full stop can be translated as Domu. So with each of these phrases or now rather translation options, because these are only phrases located in the sentence in the input sentence to cover a particular span of the input sentence. There is some scores associated. One of the scores is the phrase translation probability. That's the first one. Then there is the phrase penalty which increments by one with every new puzzle piece. And there is the word penalty which increments by one with every new, well whatever, maybe, maybe, that is the output. Yeah, so the phrase penalty increases with every output word. So I think there's there's an error. So the the output word, there's two output words. So the phrase, the word penalty should be two for this phrase and not for not for this phrase. So this is the the contributions of each of the the scores, each of the feature functions and you don't some like you sum them along the puzzle pieces. That's what the total says. And then you apply the weight. and then you apply the weight. These weights are the lambdas in the loading a model. This is something that we'll discuss in a second. And you get the weighted combination. and then you sum them to get the total score of the of the hypothesis. And so this all the features that can be calculated for the given phrase alone without any context are local ones. So the phrase translation probability, phrase penalty, word penalty, these are local features. The non-local feature here is the language model. And the language model considers bigrams. some of these bigrams are local as well. And these are by the way the bigrams that are considered in the future cost estimation. So this domu and full stop that can be estimated upfront. As soon as we are like loading this, this phrase pair from the, from the disk. But some of these bigrams span the boundaries of the puzzle pieces of the phrases. This odeshel domu. This bigram can be measured or calculated. This probably can be checked only once the hypothesis puts these two phrases together. So that's why it's called non-local. You cannot evaluate it independent of the context. You have to consider the context of the, of the, of the surrounding hypothesis in the past. Here for the language model scores the same thing applies. You like sum them. The number of elements in the sum will be different from the number of, or can be different from the number of, of the local phrases. There is again some total which is still unweighted. And then there is some weight which, which is used to, to mix that total language model feature, function cost into the total. of the, the recombination of partial hypothesis like, uh, Peter Odesel translating Peter left for, and combining it with some other, uh, like, uh, uh, Petriček, uh, uh, Pete, another translation of, of Peter, uh, combining with that. Uh, how is that affected, uh, by the language model, uh, scores, uh, and the language model, uh, and the language model, uh, and gram order.
