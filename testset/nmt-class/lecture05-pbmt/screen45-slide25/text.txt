 So I would just like to highlight that if you ever considered to use phrase-based MT, then the best implementation is this Moses decoder and there is an installation tutorial. These days people in machine translation do not longer use phrase-based MT, so everybody uses neural MT, but phrase-based machine translation and Moses decoder are still usable, very useful tool. for various like mappings of sequences. So it is now being used in linguistic analysis. For example, if you want to port some three bank annotation across languages, then you can use the phrase-based translation system because it is like more literal translation than what neural MT would do. So it is still like a good the sequence transfer system except that the the built-in assumption of phrase independence is too strong for natural languages. But this phrase independence assumption is something which can be very valid for other tasks. So Moses is now not really used for machine translation except for languages with extremely small data or for any So we will probably get to that in the future lectures. But if you have a large parallel corpus, there is no reason to stick to the assumption of phrase independence.
