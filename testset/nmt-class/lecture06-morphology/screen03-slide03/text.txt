 So the complexity of morphological system, so the system of word forms and word formation can be illustrated by comparing Czech to English. So if you are a linguist then you would know then in Czech to describe, to select one of the particular word form of a word you need some morphological tag and then morphological tag uniquely describes what the form will be. And across the language, across all the parts of speeches there are more than 4 000 Czech tags possible, while in English linguists are happy with just 50 tags. That means that the word form variety in English is so little that the linguists do not deem it important to record it in a formal device such as the tags. And this 4 000 in Czech, that's in theory, that is what the morphological system allows, like what is defined. the morphology is there for a reason or put in other words the the users of the language make use of that and the rich morphology allows people to shuffle the order of words in the sentence in many ways. That's because the syntax of the sentence is more reflected by the word form. forms then by the order of the words in the sentence. So this rich morphology comes normally or very very often with the free word order across all the languages. People simply follow the forms of the word to reconstruct the meaning of the sentence. In English you don't have this indication of what belongs to what and you have to rely on word order much more. Here is also a comparison of a from a particle power corpus this is a corpus of news commentaries. It's not too big. It's 55,000 sentences and the number of sentences is identical in the two languages. But the number of tokens will not be identical. In English you will have slightly more tokens. That's because English uses articles and we don't have them in Czech. But if you now collect all the word forms that are visible in this corpus, and we don't have them in the same way. So this is a common sense of the word form. So this is a common sense of the word form. So this is a common sense of the word form.
