 change the words in some way. So when we are translating into Czech, we have to face this complexity. As I mentioned, we have many forms. So for nouns and adjectives, for example, this is reflected in the fact that we have seven cases, four genders and three numbers in Czech. And then we have also similar complex setup for verbs. So when you are translating a sentence, you have not only the choice, and this is what the word means. So this I saw two green striped cats. This saw can be either a chainsaw or the verb seeing. So this is two clearly distinct words and you are choosing the meaning of the word saw. But in Czech, in addition to that, you also have to choose the particular ending of that word. And this is where the combinatorial explosion comes. Of these combinations, only very few are actually correct. But you have to have some good understanding
