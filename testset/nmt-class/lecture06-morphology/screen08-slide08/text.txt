 If you remember, phrase-based systems have two major components. One of them is the translation model, which is based on parallel data, and one of them is the language model, which is based on the modeling data. And there is then the global search, which uses the sentence, the small pieces, to build complete sentences. And I've already hinted a little that this global search is complicated, because you have many more options to choose from. So this search space is larger. But let's now talk about the increased complexity in the language modeling and also in the translation modeling.
