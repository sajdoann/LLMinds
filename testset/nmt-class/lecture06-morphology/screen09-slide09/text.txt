 So you are now trying to translate the sentence that was in the previous example. I saw two green striped cats. And you are choosing which word forms should be used to translate these two green striped cats. All these numerals, adjectives and nouns have many word forms in Czech. And if you were a native speaker and you considered this candidate dvou zelená pruhovány kočkách, you would immediately hear that this is garbage. This doesn't fit together. This is not a noun phrase at all. If you read the other candidate dva zelené pruhovány kočky, then you would be happy for the first three words that perfectly fits together. But then the last word doesn't agree with them anymore. And if you read the last three words zelené pruhovány kočky, then again you would be happy. So this is a sequence of four words in a row. And all the triples or the triagrams here are okay, but the foreground is wrong. And then we have two examples of the of the good cases nominative and accusative and then correct dative. So here we see that the triagram language model is too weak to ensure the agreement. We need to use a foreground so that we disregard the second example, which is which is triagram wise correct. But this is full words, fully inflected word forms. So in order for your language model to be able to choose between the second line and the third line, you would have to have a corpus, which talks about all colors and all types of striping of all animals. And only if you have all these combinations and you see them in all cases, then the language model will have sufficient data to select the good combination. So you're not a native.
