 So now what are the advantages if we modify our language models so that they don't look at word forms but instead they look rather at the morphological text. So language model has a purpose in the machine translation system and the purpose is to choose the better combination of words, the better sequences of words and it compares all the possible translation candidates. So if we're considering the probability of the bigram dvě kočkách which is wrong that doesn't agree versus the probability of the phrase dvě kočky which is linguistically grammatically correct there is the agreement then a reasonable language model trained on sufficiently large data would know it but we would need to see all the combinations of the cases and numbers and genders of this pruhovany the striping thing and kočka the cat. If we instead look at the morphological text we can simply observe on any combination of any adjective and noun that it is a bad idea to put a feminine feminine adjective in nominative in front of feminine noun in locative another case and it is much better to have these two words in agreement with respect to the gender and case. So these probabilities that are trained on morphological text will be observed on many more instances of any noun and any adjective and therefore they will be estimated much more reliably. So this is this is where it helps. I would like to highlight that the the move towards the morphological the language model based on morphological text does not help in all the cases. If you are asking what is more probable whether dvě zelené or dva zelené which is two good phrases then this in terms of morphological text converts to the question of comparing the probability of sequence of two words in feminine nominative or masculine nominative and choosing what is more probable whether feminine or masculine nouns that doesn't make any sense. So that was a bad question. in both the case of forms and morphological text. So here the language model will obviously not help. But we are still getting the benefit that the vocabulary size of these morphological text is much smaller. We don't have the two million of word forms that I mentioned in one of the previous lectures. But instead we have only the four thousand morphological text. And with this smaller vocabulary we can afford to use much longer engrams. So we can use of word forms and that gives the system quite a power about the overall grammatical coherence in the sentence. and another one knappwhoicz najasy.
