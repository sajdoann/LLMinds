 So that was the problem of rich morphology for language modeling and now the problem for the translation model. So in the translation model you have to propose what words, what word forms will be used and these are then scored and compared and selected for the final choice. But rich morphology demands to use much larger data. So if we are to translate the English word phrase kneecaps, then the Czech translation is Češky. But this word has to appear in all the cases and all the numbers. So kneecaps is actually the plural form and it has these seven cases. You see the forms here Češky, Češek, Češkam, Češky. In some cases the form, the surface form of the word is identical for multiple cases. So Češky can be both nominative and accusative and also the vocative case. So as soon as you see Češky, then technically you Běžišć, Češky. But not necessarily because the other words in the sentence will indicate Češky will indicate Češky. Češky is not invocative but nominative and so on. Češky. But for some of the word forms for Češky for Češk Češky like Češky, Češky, Češky you really have to wait Češky and gather much larger data. Češky so in order to be able to say Češky in Czech what's wrong with my kneecaps you need the instrumental case of Češky and that will appear only if you have a corpus of 50 million sentence pairs. So you have to collect that much data to be able to propose the translation Češkami.
