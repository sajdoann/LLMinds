 So this factor phrase based MT can be formalized as a sequence of mapping steps. The mapping steps or translation steps. The mapping steps translate phrases of source factors to target factors. So one of them is obviously mapping the word form to word form like two green dvia zelen√©. Then we have the generation steps and these generation steps somehow produce new factors from already known target side factors. And so here we see case things like dvia can go to feminine noun and dva can go to masculine nominative. So that's like tagging on the fly. This generative model will know what tags are possible for a given word form. And these generation steps ensure the vertical coherence in this simple schema. So they ensure that words are selected so that the form is in line with the tag that somehow came from from the source and with the lemma that is also that was created with the mapping steps from the source. And then we have the normal component there as well. That's the target side language model that ensures the horizontal coherence as we already know like the coherence in the sequence of words. But now this can be applicable not only to the first factor to the word forms, but we could have another language model applied to the morphological tags.
