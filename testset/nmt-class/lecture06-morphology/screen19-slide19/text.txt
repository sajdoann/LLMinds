 You simply replace what you are observing, the word forms, with the linguistic annotation that you are interested in. And there you will learn that if a sentence starts with an adverb, then in German the verb goes second and then comes the subject, while in English the subject is still the first and the verb is second. So here, by considering not the exact words, but instead they are part of speech text, the system has of syntactic patterns. These are short distance syntactic patterns only, but they can be helpful for these reorderings, such as adjectives put after nouns in French or this example.
