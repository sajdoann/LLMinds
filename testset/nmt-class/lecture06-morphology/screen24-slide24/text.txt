 It is exactly this. You can use a combination of lemmas and morphological text that was never seen together in the parallel data. You can use the accusative knowledge from the old man phrase and the lexical knowledge, the black dog, from the black dog phrase. That's the increased robustness that you have gained with this factorization.
