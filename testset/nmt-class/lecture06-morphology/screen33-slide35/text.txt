 The good thing is that all these processing steps can be pre-computed. So you can run this join of tables already in the stage when you are considering what are the translation options for a given phrase. So you pre-computed once when you are creating the translation options table and then you simply use these more verbose translation options in the search. So the search remains there is no change in the search at all. What is different is how the translation options are now constructed and they are constructed on the fly. So there is many more of them. That's the hard part.
