 So the translation options explode because you multiply all these tables. Originally only 20 translation options per span were considered and now you can easily get to thousands of possible word forms. So that's the morphological richness now demonstrated or run into in the real time. So you need to prune again. You prune it, select only the best candidates already during the preparation of translation options and this is exactly the place where you need to think carefully about the the joints operation and the memory complexity. If that grows too far beyond the pruning limits then you will be dropping possible translations options that will be necessary for the correct wording of the sentence. So you are like limiting the capability of the system. You are dropping some of the candidates
