 That is bad. So here are the experiments. The very first and simple setup is to translate forms into forms and then do part of speech tagging on the fly, so to say. And that allows you to use a 7-gram language model on the part of speech tag and forcing some syntactic structure over the sentence. That was one of the main problems of phrase-based empty to have some overall understanding of the sentence. So this is not a solution, but it is a partial remedy of the sentence.
