 An improvement of this is that you consider not only the part of speech tag, but also the full morphological information. And that is exactly the thing that we have discussed at length beforehand. The combination of a determiner in, well, singular and a noun in singular is good. But a combination of determiner in singular followed by a noun in plural is a grammatically wrong sequence and you should avoid it. So this is what the language model over the morphologicalales should allow you to remove. Because it will be trained on all possible determiners and nouns. And it doesn't have to relearn this knowledge of agreement for every combination of a noun. And determiner.
