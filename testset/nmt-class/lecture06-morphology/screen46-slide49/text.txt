 So let's now discuss Czech in detail because these are experiments that I've worked with for quite a while myself and I examined more setups. So the vanilla setup that we have here is to translate form to form and apply a single language model. Then we have a setup which I call translate and Czech and there we translate the form of English into form of Czech and then use generation step as a tagger on the fly. So for every word form the system also tries to identify what it's the morphological tag of that and the benefit. So there is this extra coast you are tagging the words as you have already produced them but there is the added benefit you can apply the second language model there. So you have one more language model and this check can be done twice. You can check not only the coherence of the sequence of word forms and the coherence of sequence of part of speech text or morphological text but you can also check the coherence of the lemmas. And this is like a preparatory step but reversed yet to the linguistically very motivated one that we have seen with the alternative decoding paths. You can translate the lemma to lemma, independently translate the morphology to morphology and then you combine the lemma and morphology to the final word form and this is what the user wants to see. So you have the capacity of applying three language models to check the coherence of each of these independent.
