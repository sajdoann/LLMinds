 So one thing that you have to realize, I've already hinted that, but when you are doing this tagging on the fly, this additional translate and check step, the target side morphological tags actually increase the complexity of the search. We have seen that words are morphologically ambiguous, so that means that some of the words, some of the word forms can serve in multiple cases. And if you are operating only with the word forms, then there is no reason to like separate these cases. The system is learning on the fly that some of these word forms fit well with other word forms and you are not deciding whether it was accusative or whether it was nominative. But if you are introducing this extra factor with morphological tags, and then suddenly for this candidate zelené pruhované, you really have to spell it out. You have to say that zelené can be genitive, dative or nominative. And this zelené, that has only one option luckily, but you have all the full details here. So the number of translation options will increase immediately as soon as you add this explicit information. The ambiguity was collapsing the part of the search space. So there is a trade-off. You are complicating the search, but you are also giving yourself the power to select the good combination based on the more dense statistics of the morphological tags. And this trade-off has to be well balanced. If the trade-off is not balanced well, if the complexity grows too much and the language model on tags does not like make use of this, then you are going to lose.
