 So here is the explanation why it failed. So the factored models are synchronous. And that means that all these translation options that now have the lemma and the morphological tag have to be first fully instantiated. You need to populate all the output factors. Everything has to be specified. There is no room for under-specified translation options. And then you enter the main search. And in the main search, that's only then you are putting the translation options next to each other. But it is only when you're putting the translation options next to each other where the language model can check which of the morphological tags are in line with what. So if you are translating the noun and the adjective separately and you are hoping to, for the language model on the morphological text to select the good combination of cases between these two, then you need first to all the variations of the adjective, all the variations of the noun, fully instantiate these, then in the main search, put them together and select the good combination. And if this doesn't fit into your memory, if your like pruning limits are too strict, you will drop some of the less likely individual noun forms and individual adjective forms. And you have removed the combinations that the language model would be searching for. So that's that's the key reason that you are pruning the translation options before the linear context is available. There was an attempt by Hu Huang to work on asynchronous factors and that was too difficult to put together to like structure the search, what should be explored first and what should be explored later. So that didn't really work. And what I did in another decoder of completely different nature was to use delayed factors. So there, in my configuration, I said, okay, I know that there will be too many possible cases for this noun. So let's not let's not figure out the case. And now when we do not know what the verb nearby is, or what the noun nearby is. So these delayed factors actually say that during the translation options phase, you leave one, some of these factors unspecified. And only then after the main search, is done, you will use the information from the neighboring words to fill the missing information. And then obviously you have to do the final processing steps such as finding the correct word form given the word and its case.
