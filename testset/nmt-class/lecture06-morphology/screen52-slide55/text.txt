 Translation builds upon the idea that you can separate the lexical translation and the morphological generation in language which is as complex as Czech. So in the first setup, let's train a normal phrase-based system to translate from English into lemmatized Czech. And we know from the very first slide that there is like very comparable number of lemmas in Czech and English. So this will not be too bad. the combinatorial explosion, the complexity of the Czech language. The Czech language will behave nicely. It will be like morphologically poor. And we design this lemmatized Czech so that some information which is already available in English is not lost. So for example, here this translating after a sharp drop, we know that this drop is a noun and in singular So in our middle language, kind of lemmatized Czech with improvements, we will translate it into POCLES with these details attached here. And these details say, well, it is a noun in singular and also it is an affirmative. It's not negated. So this information is already available in the source and let's not lose it in the middle language. So the first step is responsible for all the reorderings and all the like changes of number of words for various phrases. So it can handle the differences in number of words, but it is not cluttered with all with the decisions about the case. So it then we have to apply the second step, which converts this simplified Czech to the full Czech. And that is trained on much more data because it can be trained on in the same way. So you take a large corpus of Czech and you simplify it. So that's like a back processing. And this way you create your synthetic parallel data and you train the normal system to go forward from the simplified Czech to the fully inflected Czech. And this step, because there is already the richness of Czech, is limited to proceed with word for word translation. So phrase max length is one. And also it is is not allowed to do any word word wordings anymore. So it's monotone. And that way you can extract, you can effort to extract the tables from the huge monolingual data that we have for Czech. So here
