 A small parallel corpus and a large monolingual corpus, then BLEU score is already like not sure. BLEU score decreases and it says it is better to use the vanilla setup, while the semantic words counting is still improving. And here I think that the BLEU score is probably happy about the nice four grams of Czech, but it is not so sensitive about words being dropped as well.
