 If you are also collecting real parallel data, then very soon there is not much benefit of this approach. So it was extremely useful if you have less than a million, less than half a million parallel sentences. If you have about one million, it is still helpful, but from two million of parallel sentences, there is no benefit from this reverse translation trick.
