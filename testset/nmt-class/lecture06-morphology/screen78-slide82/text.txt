 So there is still quite some room for linguistics. Some linguistically adequate separation of like stems of words and their endings was carried out in this work for example for Turkish and I think Morphosaurus for Finnish and it was measured to be better than BPE. Then Matthias Hook looked at English German translation and again he did a fair bit of rule-based like linguistically motivated compound splitting and suffix and prefix splitting and he figured out what is the best combination for that particular amount of training data and language pair. In our German to Czech setups we tried unsupervised linguistically motivated segmentation of words and also supervised based on a derivation dictionary of Czech word forms but unfortunately here Catherine Cristo, the sub-tex encoder worked best.
