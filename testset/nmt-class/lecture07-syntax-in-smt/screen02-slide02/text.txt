 And here is the summary of the lecture today. We'll first somehow motivate for the use of grammar in machine translation. And we'll describe one very simple model of handling the core properties of syntax, some recursiveness of sentence constructions. And then we'll start with proper syntax in the linguistic sense. So I'll have to remind you of the difference and dependency trees. And we'll go over the use of each of these types of trees in machine translation. So for constituency syntax, we'll again remind you of context-tree grammars and then make them synchronous for the use of translation. We'll need to talk about language model integration because language model is a sequential view of the sentence and that goes against the hierarchical view of the sentence. And then we'll talk about the problems that introducing syntax brings in to the empirical approaches to the data driven approaches. That would be constituency trees. And then in dependency trees, we'll talk about both shallow and deep syntactic trees. So the deep syntactic trees are something which are uniquely Pragueian or highly Pragueian approach. It's called the tectorochromatic layer. And it's something that has been built for over a decade. and it has helped machine translation for a while. But now it's again at like a, it is a little dormant in the application area, not in the theory area because neural MT has not grown up yet to make use of that. So we'll talk about tector grammatical approach to machine translation at the end of the lecture.
