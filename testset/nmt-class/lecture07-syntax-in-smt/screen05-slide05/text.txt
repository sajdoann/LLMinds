 It's due to David Chang in 2005 and it is very rough approximation. It only allows gaps in phrases and that's it. So it will allow to translate the English do not something into no something pa but it is not a grammatical model in the sense that it will check what fits into this gap. It only allows to circumfix the verb with something but if you decide to put if you put a cat there, do not cat, then the model would happily translate it as n≈°apa. That doesn't make any sense in neither of the languages. So it's not this hierarchical approach is not good for validating whether the sentence has a grammatical structure. But if the input sentence has a good grammatical structure, then the grammatical structure of the source will be kind of preserved in the target. So for good input this is not a problem. And the phrase extraction is similar to the phrase based approach. We'll see that in a second. But the difference is that you also introduce gaps to these phrases.
