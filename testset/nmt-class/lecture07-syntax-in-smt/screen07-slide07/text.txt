 You extract one more rule. Now let's call it a rule instead of a phrase, but it is a gappy phrase. This rule says that if you have this symbol and something and that symbol and something, that can be translated as half the second something with the first something. So this is the reordering that happens here. So these gappy phrases were allowed to contain up to two gaps. and anything, any other phrase including like recursive structure could be put into that phrase. So this hierarchical model models the recursive structure of sentence construction. But there is no grammar component. The only non-terminal here that is used is one single non-terminal x and only the only thing that you have is the co-indexation between the source phrase and the target phrase. So you know which part goes where. So this is the x non-terminal. It's the unch Alumni criminal numbered in the source size and target size.
