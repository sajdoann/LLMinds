 into the gaps. So, talking about proper syntax, there is constituency trees and there is dependency trees. That is two major classes of formal descriptions of the structure of the sentence. So, constituency trees reflect only how the sentence is divided into smaller parts. So, how the words can be bracketed. So, that's the divide and conquer approach to understanding the sentence structure. here is when you see a tree, an analysis of a sentence such as John loves Mary. In constituency trees you have these non-terminals in the inner nodes of the tree, and all the words will appear only as the terminals at the final row of the tree. And that corresponds to the bracketing, and the brackets can be seen as labeled by the particle non-terminal. Dependency trees.
