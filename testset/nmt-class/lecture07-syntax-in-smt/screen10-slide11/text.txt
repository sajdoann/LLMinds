 There's one important thing. If you indicate for each of these constituents what is the most important part of that constituent, the so-called hat, the something that governs the whole structure beneath, if you mark the constituency trees for hats, then you can convert them to dependency trees. So in a sentence which has the subject part NP and the predicament the more important part that controls the structure of the sentence is the predicate part, the VP. So that's why it's the hat. And within a VP, the predicate part of a sentence, we have again two parts. One part is the verb itself and another part is the object in the sentence. And here again the more important syntactic element is the verb. So the verb is marked for being.
