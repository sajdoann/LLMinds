 So context-free grammar is the formal device to describe the constituency syntax of the sentence and context-free grammars are a way how to specify an infinite set of valid trees as opposed to invalid sentences with a finite set of rules. So we have already come across the first rule that the sentence has two parts the subject part NP and the predicate part the VP and if you want to use this in a practical system you will probably need to indicate not only that this is valid but also that other options are valid and among all the options you need to somehow discriminate so you will start assigning probabilities. So if you assign probabilities to each of these productions for example that a VP can be realized just by one word without any objects or a VP the predicate part can be a verb and a verb. and also that the VP can be a verb and two objects one could be called direct one could be called indirect whatever then you would indicate which of these productions are more common in your data and if you have a linguistically annotated tree bank so if you have a big collection of manually created trees then you can simply count how often each of these productions was used by the linguists. and you will see you will see you will see you will see you will see normalize the observed counts of VP being further expanded into V and you divide it by the total number of observations of VPN and that's it. that would be the maximum likelihood estimate for each of these probabilities. so you have a set of rules. each of these rules has some probability assigned so it is very easy to specify the probability of the whole tree given the input sentence. and you define that simply as the product of the rules that are necessary to produce this sentence from the starting non-terminal S. so this is a language model if you wish. this is a language model that considers the syntactic structure of the sentence assigns a probability to the analysis of the sentence given the sentence. this is another view of the grammatical correctness of the sentence. very much different from the standard linear order in the n-gram. very dramatic than it earns Colorado. so they were able to retrieve the order Pope the first thing ever after this 1st, because what you'll see on othereddM is every collar approach as well.
