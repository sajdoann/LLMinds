 If you are processing a given sentence, then the standard way is to parse it. Parsing is the process of finding a syntactic tree for a given sentence. And the best known parsing algorithm is the CKY or CYK algorithm. In cubic time, it will tell you whether the sentence is allowed by the grammar, by the set of rules or not. I mean, the idea is that you fill this table of non-terminal spans from bottom up. For the input, she eats a fish with a fork. Your grammar will indicate that she is a valid example of a noun phrase. So this cell indicates that you can go from point 0 to 1 with a noun phrase. This cell indicates that the word and as such, it can serve as part of a larger verb phrase or eats can be like a self-standing verb phrase, a verb which doesn't have any objects. And in that case, it would be a VP. So this cell contains two possible parses of the subtree. One is labeled V and the other is labeled VP. So this table of items, that is the set of states in the parsing. And each cell corresponds to a particular span in the sentence. And the items listed in that cell are all the possible analysis of that. And then higher up in the tree, there are cells which indicate that, for example, this VP was constructed by combining this V and then this VP and then this NP together. So that is this VP corresponds to eats a fish. And then this last VP corresponds to eats a fish with a fork. And the final sentence is constructed by combining the NP and this VP. She eats a fish with a fork. The algorithm proceeds bottom-up and populates all the cells that can be populated. And you can preserve the back pointers. And then from the back pointers, you can traverse back from the final non-terminal S down to the full sentence. And this is how you construct the full syntactic tree. You can use a template. You can use the SSIP via the sanding finger slash delimément Thalý of the ИSpec Sat-T Ji. It's through the last three. And this is how you construct the whole three. So these use the half-كلvers type of text here. It is the third-melding method that is Fresh À Left context with Después фá 멀 Twitter, isChés Há情, which is valuable. external Interact Tuesday, but also brings to the majority of these ports of mars panels.
