 which is called Synchronous Tree Substitution Grammars. And there we are not producing like one level productions. We are producing always full subtrees. And here that is already indicated with the colors the black part NP-JOHN corresponds to the black part NP-JAN. The red part corresponds to the VP within the full sub tree in love. And it has two slots. One of the slots is for the verb and the other slot is for the second or for the object. And these slots are filled with the verb FEL which maps to the verb MILUJE and MARI with MARY. And the corresponding component in the Czech constituency tree here could be just the verb phrase. the red part corresponds to this production. So in some way we can say that there is no lexicalization in this tree. This is not perfectly adequate but it is a reasonable way to make these two trees correspond to each other. Not at the level of productions but at the level of subtrees.
