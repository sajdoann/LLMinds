 The good thing is that the synchronous tree substitution grammars are actually formally equivalent. They have the same power as the synchronous context free grammars. Because what you can do is you can condense all this inner structure of these subtrees and only increase the set of non-terminals that you use. So we could use a special non-terminal VP which includes PP, P and N and has these terminals in love then. line XFET. One whole свой group, this special non-terminaluğ. and this special single non-terminal can be used in one single production and it will immediately correspond one to one. The set of productions in this contents tree will match across the languages. So synchronous tree substitution grammars are the way to map each other to constituency trees. Even if the set of productions is different. If the two trees are very different you would have to resort to a very large rule which says, well digest this whole left-hand tree, the whole source language tree and produce the whole target language tree. But that is not the type of generalization that we are after.
