 So that is the bottom-up parsing used for machine translation. So machine translation done by parsing. And the example that we had on the previous slide was still linguistically inadequate. It was not proper syntax. It was just a hierarchical model. Let's move to the true syntactic trees, those that have labels that linguists assign to them when drawing a tree bank. And on slides by David Cheng from in 2010, I will illustrate why the added syntactic information actually makes your life more complicated. So, yeah.
