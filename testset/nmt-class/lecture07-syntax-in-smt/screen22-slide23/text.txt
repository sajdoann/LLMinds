 So here is the idea. The extraction of phrases now in the SYNCHRONS 3 substitution grammars is that you as your input have not only the sentence and word alignments but you also have the trees of the source and target sentences. And you are extracting all phrases which are consistent not only with the word alignment but they also have to be consistent in each of the languages. So the phrases that you can extract are now more constrained and you are going to extract fewer phrases. And experimentally it has been shown that for various language pairs sometimes the hierarchical model was better, sometimes the phrase-based model was better and the syntactic model was most often worse. So there is two reasons.
