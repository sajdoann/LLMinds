So this trade between the two shores, that is already a prepositional phrase, which was put together and translated by the smaller rule. But now this whole thing, Taiwan surplus in trade between two shores, that's a noun phrase in English, but it's not a separate constituent. on the other language, there is still the verb phrase needed on the target side. So there is no way the system would be able to translate this as a whole. It has to decompose it and therefore it can easily introduce an error.
