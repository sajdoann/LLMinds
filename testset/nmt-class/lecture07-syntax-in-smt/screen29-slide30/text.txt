 So that is one. So there were multiple approaches how to do it with the binarization. Another approach was to construct artificial phrases just by putting the pieces together regardless whether there is any linguistically motivated component. So that was the syntax augmented machine translation by Ashish Venugopal and Andras Solman. So here the linguists would be crazy from seeing that someone says that this Chinese phrase corresponds to the combination of noun ppp and noun p. That's not a linguistic constituent in any sense. But it is a useful unit for the purposes of translation because that is what the people have written. So this is like a non-terminal generated just based on the data without any support in the grammar. But this approach allows us to process also non-grammatic.
