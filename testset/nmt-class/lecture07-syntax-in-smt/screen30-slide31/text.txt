 So one problem was too few rules and now another problem is too few derivations. So here it can easily happen that we have seen in our training data syntactic trees with some particle element that had one non-terminal. But then in practice something else is there. So more than 20 men or more than 20 in plural. Like an NS that means a noun in plural. But now suddenly in our sentence we do not get a single word element like cats or men. We get a phrase, a multi-word expression of checkpoints. And technically this checkpoints phrase is analyzed or is processed in the previous in the bottom up parsing to make an NP. So now the problem arises that we would need to plug this NP into the slot which expects the noun itself in plural. And there is no way to plug that together because the synchronous tree substitution grammar expects the non-terminals to match when you are plugging things together. So that is a problem where on the fly you are not licensed to use the pieces. You have the pieces to cover your input but your rules do not allow to plug them together. So again
