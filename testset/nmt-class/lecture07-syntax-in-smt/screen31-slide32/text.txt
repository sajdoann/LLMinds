 to make this robust enough to the inputs. You need to relax this. So in STSG you allow only matching substitutions. In higher-like all the non-terminals were the same one. So any substitution was allowed. And in proper syntactic approach, which is however robust enough to handle real inputs, you need to have this flexibility. You need to allow to plug in even things which do not match very well, but still maybe with some little cost you should allow them to match. So that's what David Cheng's paper was about. How to make the model flexible and allow it to do some of these substitutions but not all of them. Only based on the substitutions that are needed for the data. So what penalty should be paid when we are plugging in something which the grammar doesn't anticipate.
