 So here is a brief summary of the constituency syntax in machine translation. Context-free grammars can capture syntax of some languages and in a second we will see why Czech needs another device. We have described how the translation is done by parsing the source. So translation is the chart parsing bottom-up approach. We digest the input. Smaller pieces are combined with bigger pieces. and then when the whole sentence is covered you have also the construction of the target side. The target side is constructed in parallel with this consumption of the source. Hierarchical model is a simplification which uses only one non-terminal. And we have discussed how the language model is integrated by state splitting. So in the bottom-up parsing you need to keep record of what is in the boxes, which words exactly are in the boxes. So that when you are putting the smaller boxes together with the bigger boxes, your language model can run over all the words and score it. If we use the proper labels, proper non-terminal labels in the syntactic trees, then you need to do these tricks such as binarization to extract non-isomorphic trees. And also you have to allow fuzzy matching so that these pieces can be put together even if the the input was not perfectly grammatical or even if our training data did not cover that particular example that they...
