 Here is an example of how these dependencies are important. Let's take the input in English. The grass around your house should be cut soon. And here is a long distance between the grass and the cutting. So if you translate this sentence with Google, that is several years ago when the system was phrase based, then the translation was, and there are two errors in this output. The first error that immediately strikes any native speaker is that there is a bad lexical choice for the cutting. So the English word cut is very unspecific. Regardless whether you are cutting taxes or whether you are cutting bread or grass, you will still use the same verb cut. In Czech we are very detailed protocol using√©d Borch to use the end of the way that there is pretty much better retirees. Sim Cat nic in German is taki sig. Es Voldemario to use of memorable rutihu y CV. If you move on, it is a little bit kind. But in Swedish word cut isWorld. You just have the exact same gleichen leaves in German, which are very ust withstand the product often. you need to realize that it was grass that was being cut. But the grass is far away in the sentence. And actually, you see that around your house, that's already a long phrase. And you could, in principle, pump many words in between. You could say more details about the house and maybe behind the house or behind the garden, which is there. So you can easily pump many words between the and the cutting. And you can push these two words too far away beyond any limits of phrase lengths. So this is a long distance dependency. A long distance dependency is something where the syntactic structure of the sentence allows you to separate these words far away. So that is one error was the lexical choice. The other error was related to the case of that is related also with the verb, but not with this lexical choice, but rather with its passive or active form. If the sentence is translated into Czech as active, that you should cut the grass around your house, then the trava serves as the object there and it has to take the accusative. If the sentence is passive, like the grass should be cut, then the trava serves as the subject in the sentence. And as such, it needs to be nominative. So there is again, regardless of this cutting and the particular passive active choice in Czech on the target side, the case for the trava has to be decided.
