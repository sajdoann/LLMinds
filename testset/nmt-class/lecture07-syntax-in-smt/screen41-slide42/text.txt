 So that is one dependence. But we also have the other dependence between John and seeing. And this dependence is important because if it's John, then the translation of the verb will be in masculine. If it's Mary, then the soul will have to be translated as the feminine variant of the verb. Marie videla versus Jan videl. And so you have these two dependencies. One dependence was the one that we discussed on the previous slides. and cutting. They have to be in some link. You need to know that you are cutting the grass to choose the right translation of the verb cut. But you also need to handle the dependency between the subject and predicate in the John seeing. And these two dependencies are crossing now. And you cannot possibly use these two rules at the same time. So I said that hierarchical approach allows you to extract this lexical choice rule. This rule correctly ensures that cutting will be translated well. You can also extract this other rule that translates John and seeing with the proper gender for the verb. But you cannot use these two trees at the same time in the parse tree. Because either you use this tree first and for that you already have to have the the saw being digested and packed in a box. And then the other element, this John sits outside and there is no way to unbox the packed thing already. Or you can use this rule like John seeing together but then the grass has already to be digested in a closed rule. So there is no way to apply these two rules in a single derivation. And this is exactly the reason why non-projectivity is bad. Or why even hierarchical model is not adequate for translation into Czech. Because there are the non-projective constructions and one of these dependencies will have to be broken. And there is a big risk that the system will then make the bad choice.
