 Some motivation for deep syntax or the particular tectogrammatic layer that is being created and polished in Prague. And then I'll briefly talk about the tectogrammatic layer, how I applied it in my thesis with the STSG approach and why it failed. And then I'll talk about the more successful approach which is called the tecto-empty machine translation system that and did not make the assumptions that I made and therefore very much better. And one of the interesting components of that was hidden Markov 3 model which we'll also very briefly discuss.
