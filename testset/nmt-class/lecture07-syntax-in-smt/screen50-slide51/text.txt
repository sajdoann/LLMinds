 The textogrammatic layer is a long-standing theory. The theory goes back to the Panini grammar and thousands of years of linguistics. But formally it started to be formulated in the Prague linguistic circle in the mid-war era. Then in the sixties of the previous century it was written down as a form of theory. There was a lot of three banking effort that culminated around the millennium, around 2001 or 2004 where we had many languages or many sentences in Czech and English even and in parallel annotation at this deep syntactic level. And after or alongside with the three banking there was also the effort to to create tools so that we can automatically get to the deep syntactic trees just given input text. So there was all the necessary tools to automate that process.
