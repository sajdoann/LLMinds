 So here is the levels of description. You start with the sentence. This comes from the Prague Dependency 3 Bank. And you start with the sequence of tokens as they were space delimited in your input. Maybe some of the tokens had some typos or for some reason for morphological purposes at the morphological layer you need to like separate something. So this is the example here. Then what comes next is the analytical or the surface syntactic layer where every token from the input still has a node. And then this is further processed to the deep syntactic level of representation where only content-bearing words have their counterparts, have their nodes. And also there is sometimes nodes added for entities which were part of the sentence syntactically but were not spoken. So in Czech, Czech is a prodrop language. So in this example sentence you're saying he would have gone to the woods. The he, the subject of the sentence is actually never pronounced in Czech. It's dropped. But we know that someone was going to the woods. So there will be an actor for the subject kind of at the tectoromantic layer and that has been later prod-dropped. So that is an example of the node that was added.
