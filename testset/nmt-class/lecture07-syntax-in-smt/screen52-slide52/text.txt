 So here's a comparison of the analytical, the surface, and tectogrammatical, the deep syntactic level of representation. When you are moving from the analytical to the tectogrammatical, you need to hide all auxiliary words and maybe the information that they bring is stored in some attributes and then you resolve active and passive voice and other things. And you could even do things like coreference, like pronouns, that this particular, it actually refers to something which was uttered in the previous sentence. And this type of annotation is still ongoing. We are still building further and better annotated trees with more details. So here the example was, toby sem mělo zněnit, it should be changed, that's the English counterpart. But the auxiliary words are very much so there is not really an English counterpart for this B, that's just conditional particle, and this Cent reflexive or passivization particle. So there is not a big correspondence between the Czech auxiliaries and the English auxiliaries. If you look at the tectogrammatical tree, you have the predicate that's the changing and there is the attribute that something should be changed, that's the modality of that. And this change has been There's two elements, or this event of changing has two participants. And one of them is the actor who should change it, well, someone who should be changing things. And also the pronoun for the it, of what should be changed. So that's the actor and patient in the event.
