 So the tectogrammatical hope is that the transfer at the tectogrammatic layer should be easier than direct translation and that's because the structures are smaller. We have dropped all the auxiliary words. The long distance dependencies are not relevant because we have the dependency edges and they so all the non-projectivities also disappear at the tectogrammatic layer. So we should just proceed along the tectogrammatic trees. The word order is now the word order is said to be language specific. So the word order is something which is introduced during the generation of the surface tree from the tectogrammatic tree and vice versa. And also the vocabulary size is reduced because we have lemmas or tectogrammatic lemmas in the trees. So to create a good system for English and Czech translation, the hope is that it would be sufficient to use smaller M and fewer parallel trees. But obviously in each of these languages you need larger datasets to create reliable analysis and reliable synthesis from these trees. And also there could be the fancy features like coreference that would be tangible.
