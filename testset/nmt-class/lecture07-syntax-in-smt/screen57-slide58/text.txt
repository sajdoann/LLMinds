 That is nice, but there is a problem in practice. The real text-organic notes have attributes. And these attributes are exactly for the things like modality or tense. Things that were reflected by either the morphological variation or some auxiliaries in the input sentence. And now the information should not be lost. So it is not in the tree structure, but it is in the additional labels, additional attributes of notes. The STSG approach treats all notes as attributes.
