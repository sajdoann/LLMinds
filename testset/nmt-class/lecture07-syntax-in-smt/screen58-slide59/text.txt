 So the structure and the attributes clash in a way. You need to factorize somehow. You need to introduce independence assumptions. STSG factorizes along the structure of the tree. And T-layer requires factorizations along the attributes. And the question is which should go first. Whether you should have three let's full of attributes or fully instantiated phrases or factors. If you remember the phrase based machine translation. with factors that we discussed last week. Or whether you should have layers of complete trees. And one of the layers would be the lemmas. The second layer would be all the specifications of the tense. Then all the specifications of the verb modality and so on. So this is hard. It would be hard to make sure that all these layers of trees would match in structure. So I tried everything.
