 So here is the motivation for the Hidden Markov 3 model. And you'll probably have to study it separately because it will be too succinct on the slide. But the goal of the Hidden Markov model is to find the best selection of the labels for each of the target site nodes, given the source nodes, in combination.. So far we have arrived at this target site tectogrammetical tree by translating each of the labels independently of the context. And now we want to take the context, the surrounding nodes, into account, so that we select the best combination of the labels. And here the label will consist of the lexical choice the most important condensed information of how that node is used in the sentence. So for the noun translation we have two options. It can be translated either as Překlad or Převod and in both cases it will be the nominative case. For the machine we can translate it as the computer in genitive, the computer in the attributive position and also this machine as an adjective in attributive position. So počítáč, počítáč or strajový. So how do we now choose the best...
