 to the query. Yeah. So you again, these heads are totally independent of each other. So you can you again can do all these heads in a constant time, like in parallel. And you obtain eight different possible outputs. Yeah. So this is kind of surprising, or how do we then handle the, this eight times longer output than we, than we were expecting. Well, you do the normal thing. You would just concatenate them and project them to the size that you wanted.
