 All the eight heads which are there, it's much less clear what the way, what the attention looks at. So there are many strange things that are, you cannot really explain in plain words, but somehow they contribute to the best performance of the network and that's it. So we'll have one lecture in one of the upcoming weeks on the representations that are learned by the networks and this is. This is where we will go into more detail here. People have obviously experimented with a number of heads, so there is also a paper which says that many of the weights after the training can be actually pruned because they do not contribute too much to the final result. So you can then scale down your network after training and you can save some of the computation time. But this doesn't change the
