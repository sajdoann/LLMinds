 ...use of linguistic knowledge in the network structure. Obviously here the linguistic knowledge is usually the syntactic pattern, the syntactic structure of the sentence. So if you have the plain LSTM or the GRU, so the clever recurrent network units, they only consider the previous token in the sequence and that is, that can very easily lead to loss of information. If some words are far away from each other and they do depend on each other, this learning mechanism may not notice. If we help the network, if we explicitly ask whatever, the verb to consider the information that comes from the subject, then we are helping the network to realise that. So the three LSTMs are ...the modified version of the plain LSTMs and the change is that the previous state information does not come from the predecessor in the linear order, but it comes from the dependence in the tree. There are two flavours of LSTMs, three LSTMs used. For dependency trees, the property is that the order of dependence in the dependency tree, the order of children ...is not too important. Dependency trees are used for morphological rich languages where the word order is much more flexible. So the mathematical approximation of this behaviour is to simply sum the memories from all the children and that will disregard the order and it will allow for any number of children that the node happens to have in the current parse. Another variant of the tree LSTMs is designed ...to match or reflect the properties of constituency trees where there is ...the grammars of constituency trees are designed so that there is often a fixed number of children. There is ways to ...to binarise these grammars and so on. So the network then, the three LSTM is constructed to allow for a fixed number of children and not quite ...to binarise these grammars and so on. So the formulas are slightly different for this LSTM cell and they differ in whether the children can be ...of any number and whether their order is ...of any number and whether their order is ...of any number and whether their order is ...of any number.
