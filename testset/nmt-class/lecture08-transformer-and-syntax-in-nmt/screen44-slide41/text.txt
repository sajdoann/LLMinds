 We already in the past discussed the morphological information that is already by design that belongs by design to individual tokens and the way to formalize this with statistical machine translation systems was one of the easiest ways was to use factors. So these factors were additional streams of information if you remember the lecture on morphology and in null MT factors can be very easily used on the source side as well. So your word level embeddings will be a little bit longer. Some of the elements will come from the word form. Some of them will come from the dependency information in the CCG tag and so on. And already in 2016, Rico Senrich and Barry Heddo have tried a number of such source factors and it helped them in English to German and English to Romanian translation. of morphological tags or sequence of super tags for CCG. And you will generally throw this additional information out, but the network, by thinking about the syntax or thinking about the morphological categories, has a bigger chance of producing the sentence correctly. So the simple way to use a sequence-to-sequence network to consider multiple target sequences is to interleave these sequences, especially if they correspond to each, like if they correspond position-wise. So a student of mine has worked on morphological information approach, and there the translation went from English into Czech. You know that the Czech is morphologically rich, so it makes some benefit in some settings to and the vocabulary of lemmas on the even positions. So there is absolutely no errors. The recurrent neural network, the decoder, just learns to interleave these two sequences. And while doing this interleaving, the information still flows. So it knows what lemmas were produced and it knows what texts were produced. And this gave us some interesting improvements even for large data settings. So this same interleaving was also used by Maria Nadezhde in the same year. And there the interleaved information was the CCG text. So the network, before producing the word, considered for itself and said, OK, now I will produce a noun. And then it produced the noun. And then it said, OK, and now I will produce a verb which will require a subject. noun and an object noun phrase. And then it produced receives and so on. So it like a gradual, it always, before making the lexical decision, it made the syntactic decision. And that gave some improvement. Marianne Ragede also tried another thing. And that was to use multiple decoders. So this is something that we will cover in multilingual machine translation. You can split the network and then you can create multiple target sequences at the same time of varying length. We're using different decoders. And if you use two different decoders for the words and for their tags, then there is a clear risk that these two sequences will not match in length. So this is something that we will cover in multilingual machine translation. And that is something that we will cover in multilingual machine translation. So you will produce one translation and the syntactic parts of a different translation. So that is a risky approach and that didn't work so well as this simple interleaving. To franchise theorfos. So that you will have a great understanding. And that's why we'll cut this gem. And what we'll cut this film into JOHN répiths for this length, so that we had to address THIS in a moment. And keep giving out this film. Which one is what we actually行了 for this film is what's going on so the last film is what we're creating. And thank every person for what we are doing. Let's still go to the table and remember that we're going to see. And that's what's going on and what we're doing. And instead you are not even checking in on the total. And było ideal. So I will focus on all kinds of the studio vermite that are just aไ behave this film with a large 씨가 Acqua by going on in space. And then all of the time within this film is how we can show up as a story about or place the progress that will be coming for now Koop or so it's going on. So once we have done a version of one surface or the
