 Okay, yeah. So that was it. Linguists can be sometimes replaced by dummy tags. And you have to realize that by increasing the length of the output, you are effectively increasing the depth of the network. So the network is immediately more powerful. And maybe the gain is not coming from the linguistic information because the network is producing it for free. It's not difficult for it to produce. But the benefit actually comes from something else. It comes from the increased depth of the network. Here's another approach. This is just to highlight that sometimes the syntactic neighborhood can be encoded into the factors of words, not by using some formal tagging mechanisms such as the CCG super tags, but instead by following the syntactic structure using, for example, convolutional neural networks. So here the input sentence is parsed. Then this parse is used for CNN derivation, which will construct compact representations for each token. And these embeddings are syntax informed and they are combined with the normal word embedding. So this is again like word factors, except that the factors are not learned much. And they are learned considering the syntactic structure.
