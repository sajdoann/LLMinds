 So here the dummy parse that we have is the linear parse. We change the dependency trees from the correct ones from the parser to just the linear sequence. So every word depends on its predecessor and that's it. So this is the corresponding representation of such a simple dependency tree in the matrix form is that the first word depends on the root, the second word depends on the first word, So we are now training the transformer and we are training it so that it does not produce true parse but it produces a diagonal. Here are the examples.
