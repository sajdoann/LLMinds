 So this sentence is actually ambiguous. And that means that the same sentence, the same symbol, can refer to two different situations. In one of the situations, Danny is holding the bag and with the bag he is approaching the chair. And in the other situation, Danny is approaching the chair and there is already the bag on the chair. So now the last corner of the triangle is the thought or reference. So that could be the meaning representation of of this particle symbol, of this particle sentence.
