 So machine translation obviously critically depends on the meaning of the sentence. Because in translation, the goal of translation is to express the same meaning in another language. So if we are building a machine translation system or if a human is translating, they will try to disambiguate this ambiguous situation. They will try to understand from the context what was the case and what should they express in the target language. Sometimes the information is not accessible even in all the context. Sometimes you need a fair amount of word knowledge. So in that case, well, human translators simply ask their informants. They ask colleagues if they are translating something on house building and that's a complicated topic. They don't know the technical terms. They will go and talk to persons who build houses in each of the languages and they will match the expressions so that the translation is accurate. And eventually, they may, the translators may end up in a situation where they still do not know what the original text exactly meant. And then they either try to preserve the ambiguity. So make it exactly ambiguous or as close ambiguous as possible in the target language. Or they will even warn the reader like, here, watch out. It is not clear what this particular term is meant. I think it's this. So there are like translator's comments. So in good books, they, you can see them. If the author is no longer available to resolve any ambiguities, then translators may resort to just mentioning that the origin text was not clear. That was expensive. But then the original text was supposed to give themselves an explanation. Let me get the... Further anlamps is that this. How did the author do I evercon is食べ about a Sharman or caring first? And with listeners, who I like to do this and how would it spell not? I don't know why it is safer and that's good. But there's actually an important suggestion.
