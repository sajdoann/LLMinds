So you have seen these tables before in the very first lecture on machine translation evaluation and I also refer you to this very first lecture because there is a good amount of warnings that I've expressed there and you really need to know what is being evaluated, what are the systems and what the evaluation procedure was so that you do not think too much of these results.
