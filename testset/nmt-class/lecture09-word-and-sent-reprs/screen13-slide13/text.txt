 If you test online public services such as the one from Google and you feed it with one of the sentences that every student, every pupil in the grammar school, the basic school, the very first sentence that every pupil reads in the Czech Republic is this ma, ma, mele, maso. And this ma, ma, mele, maso can be translated by, for example, Google as ma, mis, min, sink, meat and that's perfectly correct.
