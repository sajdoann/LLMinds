 and check as we have discussed is a free word order language. So the word order in the question actually specifies what you are checking, what you are validating with your question. So maso mele mama or maso mama mele, you're highlighting different things that you are checking. The problem is that questions are not really or not to the sufficient amount and Google Translate makes it meat grinds mom or meat mom grinds mom. So that's totally out of the original meaning. So here is a clear evidence that the neural MT trained by Google didn't understand anything. It was able to process the words when they appeared in the order it was trained to process them but when we've stepped outside of the training data then suddenly the performance dropped beyond what is except the drop below.
