 So let's talk about representations. We have a neural network. The neural network has some inputs and it has some outputs. And you train the network to predict the outputs given the inputs. And the network has some intermediate layers. And at these layers, not necessarily layers, there are simply neurons on the paths. And these neurons activate as they process the inputs. And if you make a cut through the network, and a cut is a set of neurons so that every path has to cross this cut, then at this cut, there must be something which represents the whole input. Because from this, from the representation at this cut, the output is then constructed. So every cut of the network is a place where you can observe what the network is doing, how the network is representing.
