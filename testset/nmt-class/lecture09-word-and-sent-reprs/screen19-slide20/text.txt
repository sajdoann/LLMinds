 the given inputs. In one of the early lectures, we had this very simple example. The task was to identify whether a point is in the center or at the circumference of the 2D space. So the point was represented as the x-coordinate or x1 and the y-coordinate or x2. And the network had just three neurons in one hidden layer. And each of these neurons has the capacity to or specify a line, a separation boundary in that original space of x and y-coordinates. And with this original space where you have these three lines, the new coordinates become the distances from these three lines. So instead of two coordinates x and y, you have now three coordinates. How far are we from and on which side are we from each of these lines? And in this new space, this ABC space, suddenly there is something, it's much easier to separate the inner points from the circumference.
