 So the original space allows us to plot the input data and visualize the separation boundaries for the first layer and also for the subsequent layers. The hidden space on the other hand is designed or trained by the network to best separate the classes that we are trying to separate. And the question is now whether this representation, this is a new representation, whether this representation is good for something else than the
