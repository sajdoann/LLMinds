 Yeah, so what does it actually mean to have a good representation? And this is probably not a complete list, but these are the most important aspects. So good representations would allow to solve some main task. That is what the network is trained for. And it's natural that you are designing the network so that at some point the representation would be very good for the center from the circunference or for translating. The representations can be also good for some other task. So if you recollect word embeddings, these can be pre-trained, and they are pre-trained on some language modelling task so predicting the next word. And these pre-trained word embeddings can be good for various tasks, such as sentiment classification, or whatever, so these secondary tasks are also a way of evaluating the learned representations. And good representations will also serve well on task interfaces. So if we are talking about, for example, speech translation, you have the input audio and you first need to process this audio to obtain the text and then you continue from the text and to translate it to the target language. these two tasks are trained on different types of data. For the speech recognition, you need the audio and the transcription. For the translation, you need a parallel corpus. So if you come up with a good representation, which normal people would have just as the transcribed sentence, but maybe we could do better, this better representation will allow to translate the input speech more adequately. So good representation serve well at task interfaces. And also good representations make sense in some way. And this making sense that is visible only when we like observe the representations on a given test set. And the images or the activations that we see the representations will relate well to something that we expect to find in the representations. So for example, we can attach some to this representation and check whether some particular feature, such as the tense of the sentence, is easily accessible for this classifier in the representation. Or we will see some some examples of the evaluation in the upcoming slides. tych
