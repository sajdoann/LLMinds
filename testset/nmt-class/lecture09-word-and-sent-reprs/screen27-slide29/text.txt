 What is interesting is the representation level of the embeddings. So Tomáš Mikolov observed that this continuous space has some interesting properties. And I'm sure you have seen these pictures and you know the formula that says if you take the embedding of the word king and subtract the embedding of the word man and add the embedding of the word woman, you will get to the age of the king. so that is this type of relation in the highly dimensional space. Another relation that was observed there was that verbs and their different tenses such as past tense are also in some like particle direction. And you can also see a similar relation to between country names and capital names.
