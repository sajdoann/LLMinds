 That I would like to mention, if you write just nine rules for the regular patterns, you will surpass the performance of both of these systems in both of these datasets significantly. That is not something against the word embedding representations or the claims by Tomáš Mikolov. It is just to illustrate that if the network is trained for some tasks testing it on another task may be interesting but if you can write nine rules and you are interested in the morphological behavior, the regular patterns then you will get much better results without any deep learning whatsoever. So always think about what is your task and whether your task is to analyze emergent representations or whether your goal is to have some morphology analyzer and if you want some morphology analyzer write the nine rules Don't bother with the word embeddings. So use external knowledge. Use knowledge when you have it.
