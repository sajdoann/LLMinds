 from the meaning. So what is the meaning of the sentence? Well, I don't really know. I don't want to go into too much details because I'm not a philosopher. I'm not a cementicist. So I have just my very simple understanding of the meaning of the sentence or meaning of the meaning. The meaning, I see the meaning as coarsening. So if you search for semantic representations on the internet, what will emerge is also the semantic segmentation of pictures. And I've never thought about the meaning of pictures before, but I really like their definition. So what they do is they label each pixel in the picture with some class label. And now it depends on what you are asking. So if you are searching, shows the reference of an expression. So if you have people in blue coat, then that would be those two little boys there. So that is the semantic representation of pictures.
