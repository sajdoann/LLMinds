 So that's the ambiguity, the statefulness, the decoder is very nice or the state of the decoder can be seen as a very nice state representation. It is like the state of mind after reading the input sentence and producing a part of the output. So this is also better captured, it kind of corresponds to the models with attention. And the Polnes is necessary for many human processing tasks of language. For example, when you want to process jokes you really need to make sure there's some state evolution in that modeling. The stateless meaning is what we're mainly working with. That's what corresponds essentially to the encoder state and that suffers the problems with the ambiguity. So you are done one expression maps deterministically to to some represent.
