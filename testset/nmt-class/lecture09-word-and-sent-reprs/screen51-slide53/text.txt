 There are other ways of exploring, and that's also some work in progress, of exploring this continuous space of sentences. So what we are doing is that we are proposing directions of exploration, and we are asking human informants to modify the sentence in a particular direction, and then we will ask the human annotators to to tell us a sentence in between the two examples of a particle direction, or further stronger expressions of extrapolation of that. And then we would validate this relation and we would create a partial ordered set of sentences.
