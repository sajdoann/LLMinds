 Then you can ask another set of annotators and give them this pair, can you move so that I can see the screen? That's one extreme and the other extreme you give them is you aren't made of glass, you know. And then the annotators will be asked to create sentences which are in between. So this is still the politeness and rudeness dimension and people will come up with sentences such as hey can you move or please move or could you move a little bit, you're blocking the screen. So there is many ways to formulate the same message.
