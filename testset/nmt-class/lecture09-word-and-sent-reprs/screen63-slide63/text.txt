 in general. So, SenteVal is something that I definitely need to mention. It is a repository, so to say, or toolset for scoring sentence representations in many ways. So, you are the author of a sentence representation. So, someone gives you a string, a sentence, you convert it to a vector and then this vector is evaluated� Champion we are. tumorзed by SenteVal a sentence epilepsy reference. Actually the vector cannot be evaluated alone, so obviously you need to proc carse a large number of sentences and return a large number of vectors and these vectors are then evaluated in the various tasks and these tasks can be what is easily accessible in the representation And then several representations were compared using this sent evaluation toolkit. So some well-known sentence representations are infrasent or skip thought or laser. So there are many. And then you can also explore what is in the representations, which sensible or meaningful properties are we able to extract from which representations. And there is a workshop on this. There are a few years of a few instances of the workshop. Blackbox NLP. It's a very active area of research. So I highly recommend the papers because they study what the transformer representation has access to, what it knows and what it doesn't know. So I'm not surveying the most recent results there, but they are interesting.
