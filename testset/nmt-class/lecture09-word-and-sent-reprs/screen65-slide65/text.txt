 So this is the Senteval style of evaluation. You have some classification tasks. So one of the classification tasks is the conversion from the string describing a movie evaluation, a movie review, a short movie review, to some scale. And if the, so if you want to process, if you want to perform this task, using some neural network representations, what you will do is you will convert the input sentence to the hidden representation. And then you will give these representations to the Senteval tool and it will train or just observe similarities. It will learn to process your representations, your continuous representation of the sentences in such so that it can predict the score and it will check how often it was able to find the good score. So if your representation is contains relevant features, then the Senteval evaluation will be able to predict the correct score very often. So that will indicate that your representation is good.
