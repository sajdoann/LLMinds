 There are also paired tasks such as the natural language inference task. And there you are asked to embed two sentences, one at a time. And then the pairs of the representations that you have produced are being evaluated. So these, the natural language inference tasks has three classes whether one sentence is entailed in the other, whether they are neutral to each other, so they are about different things or whether they are in conflict with each other. And you need to classify pairs of sentence embeddings or sentences and the extent to which you classify this well will tell you how good your representation is for the inference task. So an example of the entailment would be a square full of people and life and another sentence, the other sentence would be the square is busy. So yes, these sentences are one of them implies the other. So that's the entailment. There is neutral, so there was a bad prediction. The couple is at a restaurant, a cute couple at a pub. So this should be again in entailment relation. The system which relied on your embeddings predicted that these sentences are neutral and that's wrong. So in general, this is like a reasonably good performance because there was
