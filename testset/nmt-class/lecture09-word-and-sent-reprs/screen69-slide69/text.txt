 Then you can also evaluate sentences through similarity. There you ask human informants how similar in some way are these two sentences and humans will give you a score and then you will evaluate the sentence embeddings either by training regression on the training data if there is some and if there is no you can simply measure the similarity between the embeddings and predict the similarity by the similarity of the embeddings. So we this is.
