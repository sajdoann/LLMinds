 So we have evaluated a number of these architectures and with the measures that I've mentioned previously and we have trained these systems to translate from English into Czech or German and we were evaluating the English sentence embeddings. It is important to mention also that the data sets differed for the English to Czech. We use the large corpus of very diverse domains. for the English to German we used only the Multi-30k dataset which is on image captions. So the results are affected by the size of the training data and the domain variables.
