 So one head will be always looking at the beginning of the sentence. The second head or another head will be looking at the second part, third part, up to the last head which will always look at the look at the final part of the sentence. So that is an interesting observation. It again documents that the system is processing the sentence in a very shallow way. It is like network. It is not deep, but it is superficially following the sentence left to right. And therefore there is no surprise that the more heads you have, the worse it will perform in some like polarity check tasks because the information whether the user was happy or whether the watcher was happy with the movie, will be present anywhere in the sentence. And the heads will only like divide this information. So it will be harder to search for the information on the quality of the movie because you have to do it across the heads. If you have fewer heads or if you have no attention at all, the whole sentence is available within the vector at the same level and you don't have to search for the information so much. So this is an illustration that the processing is
