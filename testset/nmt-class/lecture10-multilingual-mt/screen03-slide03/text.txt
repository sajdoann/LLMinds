 So now let's talk about the motivation for multilingual machine translation. So for many languages there is not enough parallel data. If you are translating from German into English then obviously many texts have been previously translated. But if you are native of an Indian state and you want to translate from ODEA to English or across many of the Indian languages from ODEA to Marathi then there would not be so many parallel texts and maybe the text there would not be available digitized text at all. So there are many languages which are so-called low resource. On the earth there is about 7000 languages and only a handful of those have sufficient resources for training a good performing machine translation system. the more languages they learn the easier they learn further languages because the words become similar. You will know how to what would be the word stem in Romance languages or Germanic languages. To some extent languages from the same family would be even mutually understandable. So there is obviously some benefit if you know more languages and if you know related languages because the grammatical construction and the vocabulary size will be shared. So the idea is that automatic systems should be also able to exploit this language similarity. This kind of motivation is related only to the fact that you want to like learn the other languages and then focus on the one task at hand that that you want to perform in. But sometimes you can also have a setting where the same document is already available in multiple languages and you will and you will know the same. And you will know the gender of various things and you will also know the cases because the grammatical structure will be to some extent and comparable across languages. So if English does not mark words for subject or object other languages will and if you have this other translation available already then you can use this additional information from French and produce the Czech or German translation easier. So that is the second motivation the improving of translation quality if your text comes in multiple languages and you are adding further languages. And then there are many truly multilingual environments. So the United Nations they have six official languages. Then the European Union has 24 official languages. We are working on a project for the supreme audit institutions and they have this international group which is called EuroSci and the members of EuroSci, the countries and other bodies in total they have 43 official languages. So that is just the European area. And there is also the Intosci where there are further languages needed. So in these environments you would really like to provide translations into all these languages and building independent models for each of these would be very time consuming and it will also consume a lot of resources at runtime and the stored models would be big. So there is a good need to
