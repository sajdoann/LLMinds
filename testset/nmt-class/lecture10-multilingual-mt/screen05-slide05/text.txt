 The implementation in transfer learning is that if you have the training curve for your task, this is the typical trading curve for neural machine translation systems, where you do not see any overfitting. This is like a well-regulized model and the training data is sufficient, so you don't see any degradation of the performance as the training progresses. The performance on the development set grows and then stays stable
