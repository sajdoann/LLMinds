 And that's... We'll touch upon this challenge a little later. So now back to the transfer learning task. The early works focused on the setup where we have one language in common and that was usually the English and also the languages were always related in the early experiments. So we experimented with something which included language pairs and we had this idea of trivial transfer. Simply train on the parent language pair and then switch the data set to the child language pair and don't change any of the parameters or hyperparameters of the training.
