 is the difference of the BLEU course when the model is trained on the child language pair only or whether it is first trained on the parent and then the training continues on the child. And you see that when translating from English we get some improvement and when we translate into English we get a bigger improvement. And there the reason is probably that the additional English data directly help in the language model of the or like in the in the in the child model so so the decoder really benefits directly from from the parent training data. In the setup where you go from English the encoder knows English better but it doesn't help it too much to improve producing Slovak because Slovak is obviously different than Czech.
