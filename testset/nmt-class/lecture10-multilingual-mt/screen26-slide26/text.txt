 And now a setup where there is no language in common. And here the test set, the child that we are trying to achieve, is Estonian into English translation. And we train on corpora like Arabic Russian or Spanish French or Spanish Russian or French Russian. These all come from the UN corpus, so they are of the same size and they are 12 times bigger than the intended child. And the interesting observation is that in all cases we do get an improvement again. It's not as big as before, so there is no language in common, no vocabulary can be reused, the shared vocabulary does not get any benefit from including Spanish and French words for Estonian English translation. But there is some improvement.
