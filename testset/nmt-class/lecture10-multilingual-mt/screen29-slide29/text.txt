 Here is a simulated very small setup, very low resource setup. We are again translating into English-Estonian and going from English-Finnish, the related language. And as we reduce the child data size, the performance of the baseline model, which is the blue bars, will decrease horribly. With just 10,000 sensors, sentence pairs you cannot expect any good performance. So the blue score is just close to two points. But if you use this very small parent model, the 10,000 English-Estonian language pairs, sentence pairs, if you use this to continue training on the parent which is already well trained English-Finnish model, you will get 10 blue points increase. So for very low The transfer learning is very useful. That again illustrates that the bigger the difference in training data sizes between the child and parent, the bigger the gain you can expect.
