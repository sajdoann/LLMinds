 And we use these parents to continue training on the child setup. And there we see that if we use the full, the normal, unconstrained parent, the improvement or the baseline performance would be 19. That's the good transfer learning. It has helped somewhat. I forgot what is the child alone performance. And the average length is 15. 15.4. Well, some length that relates well to the particular test set. And the parents which are constrained to produce only sentences either too short or too long, these parents help less. So indeed there is some degradation in the transfer learning. But the average length is okay. So the child data, despite being rather small, the model to unlearn the length limitation that the parent had. So the length is good. But the BLEU score does not benefit that. You don't see that much benefit in the in the BLEU score from this.
