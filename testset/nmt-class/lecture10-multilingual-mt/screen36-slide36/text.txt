 Here, there are many possible configurations. So let's agree on some terminology. Something which is very old, an old idea and well-tested, is called pivot translation or cascading. There you build two separate systems. So if you want to translate from between some low resource languages, then you can go over some high resource languages. So for example, when translating between Czech and German, you could go from Czech into English and then from English into German because Czech and English and German English would have obviously more data available. So the middle language is called the pivot language and that was tested with the previous generations of machine translation systems as well. Sometimes it's also called cascading because you're like putting the systems in a cascade. This pivot translation is also used by interpreters when they are sitting in the booth. They call it piloting. So they are translating from... So they are interpreting... One interpreter goes into some intermediate language and this is further interpreted by the other language. And it was also used in the past or it is used when you are translating into many languages. You will first translate from for example from English into Czech and then you will translate this Czech into Slovak because Slovak and Czech are similar and it's faster and easier to translate between related languages than between unrelated languages, even for humans. So that's why this pivoting or piloting in the spoken domain can be beneficial. But in the pivot translation there is only one language pair of interest. So what you can do is you can work on a system which happily digest various source languages and this would be called multilingual source site. And sometimes it's referred to as multi-way because in the same setup you would like to be able to process Czech to English and German to English and French to English. So this any English setup would be multilingual source, like multilingual source, then you can have a set up which is multilingual and multi-source. And that highlights that you are expecting to have multiple inputs at the same time. And you can do the same set up on the target side. So either you are training your system to be able to produce many target languages or you are expecting it to produce many target languages at once. So that would be multilingual and multi-target. And then you can go for both sides. and multilingual and multi-source and multi-target. There is one more term which is good to know that's called zero-shot training. So in zero-shot training, when you have this system which can digest different languages and it can produce different languages, can we also use it to translate a pair that it never saw as a pair in the training data? So that's the zero-shot. The source language was included among the sources. The target was included. but the pair of the two languages was never there. And beyond zero-shot is when you expect the system to translate into a language which it hasn't seen at all or from a language that it hasn't seen at all.
