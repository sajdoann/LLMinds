 So this is the setup when we have only a single input sentence and then we are moving towards the setup where we have two input sentences one in Spanish and one in French and we are translating into English and we are using either this late averaging or this early averaging of the knowledge that comes from the source language. the baseline is to use just well the baseline is probably 32 and the short message is that the early averaging and late averaging each of them helps. Well early averaging alone is worse than the baseline but the late averaging is a little bit better and the combination of using both of using the information from the source languages at the same time is the best setup.
