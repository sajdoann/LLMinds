 from the transfer learning setup in that these systems should achieve also good performance on all the language pairs of interest. In transfer learning the focus was only on the target language, the child language pair and the performance on the parent after the fine-tuning or continued training on the child was not important. So, maintaining the performance on the other languages, is what complicates the possible gains, and we saw that have gone the gains across the many setups only in the case of where the target language was shared. And when the target languages were distinct, then it was better to train the independent system. But still, these multilingual systems are interesting.
