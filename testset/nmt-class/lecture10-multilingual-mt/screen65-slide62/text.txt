 But when we do the other direction, when we try to create this multilingual system to actually produce the non-English, the non-common language in the setup, then sometimes it helps and sometimes it significantly decreases the performance. So, for example, having English-German training data in the English-French translation, that will give you a big loss because it will probably learn the German word, or the end, will try to produce it in French as well and that's a bad idea. And it's also related to the oversampling, the sizes, the mutual sizes of the corpora. the French and German were of different sizes and either you preserve the original distribution or you could skew it so that they are on par and in each of the cases you get a loss in one of the languages. Yeah. So, these experiments are not very promising. Like, you can...
