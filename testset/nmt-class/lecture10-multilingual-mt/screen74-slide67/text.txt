 And if you look at the translation quality baselines, I don't know how exactly they measured this because this is the BLEU scores are not comparable across languages so there should be probably some human judgments behind this. The natural thing to expect and the natural thing that we really see is that the translation quality is better for the high resource language than for the low resource languages.
