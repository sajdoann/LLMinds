 message to remember. So there is even further work again by Orhan Ferden and colleagues. They try to again reduce the size so you're using kind of special type of these experts. These experts are for the different languages so they introduce a tunable sublayer so most of the network is pre-trained on the big mixed corpus on the main languages. contagioning on these small adapter layers. So most of the network remains the same but throughout their network there are a few experts. That are in a supervised way trained for they particle language pair are of interest. And then at runtime you will have than most of the network loaded language pair at hand and then it will the model will translate.
