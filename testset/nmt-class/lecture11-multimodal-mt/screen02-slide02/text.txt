 This is the outline. I'll first give a very brief overview of including all this additional information and then I'll focus on speech translation which is essentially combining speech recognition with machine translation in order to be able to translate what people are saying instead of what has been written in the text. And there we'll talk about the immediate integration of these two independent systems. So if we just and we'll contrast that with the recent approaches where the whole task of going from the source language speech to the target language text is being modeled in one step with some deep neural network. So that would be the end-to-end approaches. And in the second part of the lecture I'll be talking about including visual information. Yeah. So there is a very recent survey on multimodal approaches to machine translation. by Sulubacic and colleagues and I heavily use that because it provides the most recent overview of the approaches and it's a great resource. It also discusses which I'm skipping actually in my talk. It also discusses the data that is available for all these enterprises and obviously data is always critical because you have to have the right combination of inputs and expected outputs to be able to train these tasks. So we'll mention some of the data issues later on but if you want to look at direct links to corpora of images and and the parallel text with images parallel text with video for example or sound recordings please go to that.
