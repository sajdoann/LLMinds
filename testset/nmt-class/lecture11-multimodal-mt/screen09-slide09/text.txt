 I'm going to discuss, but what is still a very interesting emerging technology is some visual guidance or video guidance to the translation. So if you have the speech and the speech is present in the video, or if you have just a sequence of images, a video which is related to the text that you are translating, you may want to include this information in processing of the source text. Again, to better choose the target So the visual guided translation is something which we will see being developed in the coming years. They're only first attempts so far, and I'm not going to discuss them today.
