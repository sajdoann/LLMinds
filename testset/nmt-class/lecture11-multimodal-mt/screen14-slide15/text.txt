 This is a motivation why it makes sense to put these two technologies together. This is the performance of spoken of speech recognition in the recent years after the introduction of deep neural networks and through a series of developments including more data or new algorithms the systems got up to the human from the end level performance in around 2017. So we can hope that the speech recognition will be better than humans. So the transcription of spoken language into words will contain fewer errors. This is the standard measure, word error rate and that would be better than if a human was typing what has been.
