 sentences and there could be some uncertainty. We'll see some examples of problems that arise from that. So if the ASR is not sure, for example, if I say ice cream, it could be the delicious cold thing that you eat in the summer. Or I could be mentioning that I'm screaming because I got afraid of something. So this ice cream is an ambiguous sound. and the system, if it has to emit only one output, will guess what the correct output should be without access to further context. And then the machine translation will take that candidate, for example, the delicious summer thing, as the ground truth, and it will translate it into the target language. So if if we had some NBEST list in between these two components, if we were shipping uncertain outputs of the ASR, then obviously there will be lower risk of the user getting a completely confusing message.
