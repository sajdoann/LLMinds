 So here is a summary from that student fair festival. So if we look at the word error rates, on the very first slide I was talking about the word error rate of 4%. So 4% in 100 words are misrecognized and that would be the human level of recognition quality. Here we are 10 times worse. than the humans. And this is the performance measured on the recordings. So this is actually offline. So the recognition after the recording has been made, not the online mode. The offline recording and evaluation where all the systems were able to produce any output whatsoever. And if the sound input is too bad, some of the systems really give up. So if we evaluate on all recordings and we give a score of zero, 100% word error rate if the system has given up. Then we will see that the scores are yet a bit worse, so the Google is giving up and it is approaching to total failure on that. It's close to 100% of word error rate so nothing.
