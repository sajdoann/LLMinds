 Here is an example... Where are you going to? Hi, 15. And you? 20 second Would you mind if I take off my shoes? Those highsees are killing me. Of course I don't mind it. Thank you. Why do you wear those highsees? If you would wear some sneakers. I know one really good store that deals with the sale of free time footwear. Oh really? Yes, actually, I work for them. So that was this part. The manual transcript said, why do you wear those high heels if you would wear some sneakers? I know one really good store that deals with the sale of free time footwear. And the Google recognition, so this is the best segment in that small collection. The best segment as recognized by Google is why do you wear those instead of those high heels if you would wear some sneakers? speaker that we were listening to and another part is the spontaneity of the speech. These were prepared sessions. The high school students have worked hard to test these sessions because they were competing in their presentation capabilities. And yet, obviously, they made various grammatical errors and the grammatical errors then, combined with the pronunciation errors, the sequence of words difficult to properly recognize. So, if the system cannot really trust the pronunciation and it cannot really trust the sequence of words because the grammar is wrong, then it is very likely to choose some wrong wordings. So, the human level of performance would be four words in ten to be wrong. and in our test set of these 90-second speeches, we were ten times worse and the online system, for example, by Google was failing almost completely and similarly, Microsoft ASR as well. So, you can read in many papers that speech recognition is getting superhuman and that's true in that particular setting of that experiment, but it is usually far from truth if you use some noisy input and you don't have good control of the recording environment and if your speaker is...
