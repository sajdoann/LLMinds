 Here is an example of a text input sentence, but it is much more difficult to ask if you do not have any clue. And the error that I'm demonstrating with our system into German is this mistranslation of the if. It is much more difficult to ask if you do not have a clue. So the if is translated op, translated as op, and that corresponds to the English weather. So the meaning that the German that the German speaker gets is that it is difficult to ask whether you understand or do not understand. It's not that it's difficult to ask in the case when you don't understand. So this is the standard ambiguity of words and standard translation error. And these will appear in the outputs in addition to the errors induced by the by the the speech recognition pipeline or component beforehand. Then another example is some word which falls out of the vocabulary. You can be reported after some profanities. This was translated as you can be reported due to some professional things. So these profanities was not known to the English to Czech translation system and the subword units played against the system and it started the word prof and they didn't know how to continue. So it made up something more frequent professional things instead of profanities.
