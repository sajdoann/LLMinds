 And they train it in the multitask, they train it in multiple ways, but this is the pre-training approach. So they first train only the speech recognition, that is the dotted curve here. So the lower the better it is over the learning steps. It is learning to produce the source-side transcript. And then they switch over to the multilingual setting where the system is the target language transcript. And similarly for machine translation, they first pre-train it in the monolingual task and then they add the source language. So the components of the neural network are pre-trained on independent and easier to obtain datasets.
