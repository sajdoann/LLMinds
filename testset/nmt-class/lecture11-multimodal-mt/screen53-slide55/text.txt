 Here are the scores. So the cascaded approach still delivers better scores, but if they put together all the end-to-end approaches they work with, then they are getting very close to that cascade. So the ensemble that gets the test blight score 15.5 compared to 15.8 of the cascaded approach is actually an ensembling system. all the three subsystems help to decide. One of them is the directly trained end-to-end, one of them is pre-trained with the individual parts, with the speech recognition and the machine translation, and they also have the multitask training system. So the multitask alone performs best, but the best result is when they use these three systems at the same time. And I've mentioned that this joint pipeline can benefit from fewer parameters and that is reflected in the last column. It's 9 million parameters that are used in this, in this ensembling system, compared to 6.3 in the ASR only and 15 or 16 million in the translation component. But remember last week we have discussed the multilingual models and there we were getting to billions of parameters. So to get a decent performance on open domains, you would definitely need to go much higher in terms of the size of the model.
