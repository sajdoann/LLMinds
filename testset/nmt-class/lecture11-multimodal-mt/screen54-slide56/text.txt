 So here is a summary of the results from the survey by Silvachak and we see that there has been quite a big improvement over the last two years and we are really getting on par or very close to the to the cascaded system. What is still not not clear is which architecture would be the best so some people use convolution networks networks and LSTM some use convolution networks and transformers some use paramidal recurrent neural networks some use the knowledge distillation so teacher student approach some use pre-training some use multi-task setup so so it's it's a battle which is still running very fiercely and we don't know which approach will win the transformer alone.
