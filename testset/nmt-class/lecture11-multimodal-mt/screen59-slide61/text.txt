 This is what we are trying now in our project, Eliter, as I mentioned. We are producing subtitles in many languages at once. And if you want to show these many languages to the multilingual audience, then you have very limited space for each of the languages. And with this limited space, it is often difficult to squeeze in the information and to keep it stable. So maybe a better option.
