 So this is just an illustration of what we're struggling with. We have the ASR output which is the sequence of words and then we have the segmenter and the segmenter inserts punctuation and we are shipping these partial segments to machine translation and then the segmenter will maybe decide after some more words arrive to put the punctuation at a different place and then the machine translation will translate the complete sentences and we are showing these concatenated sentences in one or two lines of subtitles and the component that we had to develop for this which we call subtitler it decides when to move the subtitles one more line so that the user will see the subtitles not flickering and what would be very annoying if suddenly something which has been already shown and moved out of the subtitle space of the two lines if that would have to be updated because the segmenter changed its mind and then the subsequent machine translation system changed its mind as well. So this illustrates that if you have a limited space then you may be forced to emit some output and update it afterwards and that will confuse the user.
