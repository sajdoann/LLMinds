 I just want to highlight that there are more aspects to consider when comparing the outputs of machine translation system, text-based only. There you only consider the quality of the translation and that alone is a complex enough task. But in spoken language translation you also want to know how much are you behind what has been just uttered in the online setup and some flicker.
