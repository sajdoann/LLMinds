 Here is another example. There is again a number of datasets and please have a look at the survey that I mentioned. Another dataset which is not in that survey is what we created. There is this database called Visual Genome and that links images, rectangular areas in those images with English captions and we have translated these English captions into Hindi. The idea is to use the rectangular information or the whole to improve the translation. And here is an example where even with the picture we didn't get it right. Two lamps lying in the sun was translated as some Hindi text and the glosses two baby sheep are telling lies. So lying was mistranslated. So here the picture may be not helping as much as you would like to. Maybe they are lying in the sun and lying to each other. So both both could be happening and the picture doesn't indicate it. But still lying in the sun is like more commonly related to the act of lying and you could see that in the picture. So the picture could hint to the correct translation.
