 What we did is we created a dedicated test set of our challenge test set that was focused on ambiguous words. So we have searched the whole visual genome. It's automatic Hindi translation and in about three million strings of like this description of short of small regions in the image. We found actually a a few words that would be ambiguous. Maybe that's the side effect of using machine translation system which did not have rich enough vocabulary in the target language. So there were only too few ambiguities arising. But then we manually like subselected and we arrived at 19 words that are ambiguous on their own. The first one could be stand or chord. This is how often they now appear in the challenge test set. these words have different translations. So one of these words which was not there we were trying to find it in the corpus but it just didn't appear in the whole visual genome. And a word ambiguous like that could be mouse which could be translated as the rodent. The rodent mouse or the computer mouse. And there would be different Hindi words for that. So mouse would be another ambiguous word but it didn't appear in the data set. And then the point was to translate sentences with these words and hopefully the image would have helped.
