 Here is an example of the word penalty. And unfortunately, as you see, well, obviously the images indicate that the penalty in the left-hand picture is the fine that you will have to pay for something. And the penalty or the penalty box is related to the soccer game in the right-hand picture. So the pictures here are clearly informative. But the problem is that the words round in the input sensor are already sufficiently informative. If you have a street sign advising of penalty, it would not be in a soccer game. And if you have a penalty box and the white lining around it, that again will indicate that very likely this is related to the soccer game and not to paying a fine. So the surrounding words can be very informative.
