 Good afternoon, thank you very much to the European Commission and to the European Parliament, who also invited me here, in other words to the Representation. My name is Kilian Kirch-Gessner and I am a German journalist. I would like to talk about subsidies here, we already talked about this topic at the beginning, but I would also like to include the Czechs. The Czech Republic has benefited greatly from its accession to the EU in 2004. We all know that, we have already discussed various figures here. But Western Bohemia in particular has benefited a great deal. And it has not only benefited from subsidies, but also from tourism. Nevertheless, around half of the Czechs are sceptical and President Semmann is even talking about an EU referendum. I would like to mention one example of why it is worth being part of the EU. The example is the Teppler Monastery. This monastery is located in western Bohemia. It is a few kilometres away from the border with Upper Palatinate. It is a huge complex. Around 140 monks belonged to this complex at the time. The monastery also includes the country's magnificent baroque library, several farm buildings and a park covering several hectares. The complex has been in decline since the communist era. Soldiers were housed here, who used the historical books from the monastery libraries for heating until they realised that parchment does not actually burn. So many of the books were destroyed. Almost 500 million Czech crowns have been channelled into the Teppler Monastery from EU funds. That's the equivalent of around 20 million euros. Today, the monastery is home to a handful of monks. And now an academy is also active in the renovated part. Seminars are held here, as well as concerts, various conferences and exhibitions. Another example that shows that it is worth being part of the EU is the region around Mariánské Lázně and Karlovy Vary. This region has been considered the poorhouse of the Czech Republic since the political changes. The economy in this region is weaker than the national average. And emigration and hopelessness are very high. The Prague region has launched a support programme for the region. But the EU, on the other hand, has been very active for many years. The EU has always had the same goal of creating equal living conditions in all parts of the European Union. A few kilometres from Teplau Monastery is the village of Chodowa Plana. There is a local brewery and it is a centre of attraction in the region. You can find there good cuisine, a nice restaurant and which is completely underground in a rock. One of the fermenting cellars used to be here. Once a day, tourists can immerse themselves in the history of the brewery with a guided tour. Naturally, there are many visitors here. There are cars in the car park with number plates from neighbouring Germany. Even Dutch and Italians find their way to the brewery. And of course since 2004, when the Czech Republic became a member of the EU, the number of visitors has continued to rise. The brewery has long been run by his two sons, the sons of the previous owner. In 1992, the family bought the brewery in the first wave of privatisation after reunification and saved it from ruin. Since then, the business has actually been doing very well and the numbers are always increasing. The company has a total of 130 employees. And it is the largest employer in the surrounding area. The EU is omnipresent in West Bohemia. Because of its subsidies, of course, which is understandable, but also because of the flow of tourists, which is of course also linked to the subsidies. And the image of the EU is still poor. In surveys, only between 25 and 45 per cent of Czechs express a positive opinion of EU membership. In the Czech Republic, however, it is not popular to be in favour of the European Union. It is also a problem that is represented by politicians. A new Chamber of Deputies was elected in the Czech Republic. That was earlier, of course. But it is very different from England, France or the Netherlands. There, the EU does not play a major role in the party election programmes. Even though many regions benefit from EU funding. In the meantime, however, Milos Semman is also more in favour of China and Russia than the European allies. The Czech Republic is a special case in Central Europe. Although the government is in favour of the European Union, the majority of the population is sceptical. Paradoxically, the situation in Poland and Hungary is quite different. Although the current governments there are Eurosceptic and berate the EU, the public is more pro-European than here in the Czech Republic. Of course, this also has to do with a certain basic Czech attitude. Czechs think their country is small and insignificant. They don't believe that they can change anything. Brussels is therefore something they have to put up with. Poland and Hungary, on the other hand, are proud nations with great self-confidence. They are not afraid of the EU. They do not see it as a construct to which they have to submit. The younger generation in the Czech Republic is quite different. The younger generation takes the EU for granted. It is a natural part of life. It's almost impossible to imagine that it could be any different. Many people travel across the border in the summer to go swimming, for example to Germany. They shop there and work there. For them, the EU is a part of life that they take full advantage of. So here's to the next 15 years. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
