 Hello, thank you very much for the invitation. I would first like to introduce myself. My name is Erik Nielsen and I'm head of the economics department at Unicredit Global. So, this anniversary is worthy of congratulations. We all agree that unity is strong and a united Europe is important. It has many advantages. But we also all know that all coins have two sides. On the one hand, membership is certainly an advantage. But that doesn't mean that the Czech Republic has to agree with everything the EU says. We have already heard that Euroscepticism is present in all countries and it is still on the rise. I would like to discuss the eurozone and the introduction of the euro. I will mention the advantages and disadvantages of its introduction. And I am glad that the previous speaker has already mentioned this. Firstly, I would like to say that all EU Member States have committed themselves to adopting a single currency. There is also the exception of Great Britain and Denmark, which do not have to introduce the euro. There are certain criteria for the introduction of the euro that must first be fulfilled. And this has not yet happened in the Czech Republic. That is why there is no euro in the Czech Republic yet. It would not be difficult for the Czech Republic to fulfil these criteria today. But it is also unlikely that the Czech Republic will introduce the euro today. From this point of view, I think it's great that there is another country in Central Europe that has good relations with the Czech Republic and that can be compared favourably with the Czech Republic. This country has introduced the euro and this country is Slovakia. How did things look at the beginning, after Slovakia introduced the euro? Some forecasts were negative at the beginning. But I think we can now say that Slovakia is an advert for success as far as the introduction of the euro is concerned. It is also a good example of European integration and the single currency. The arguments against the euro and the eurozone are similar to the arguments used against the whole European Union. If they are in the EU or the eurozone, they are not their own cooker. But that's just one opinion. In this case, the opponents say the following. If they are in the eurozone, they cannot influence the free market in the same way, because everything is controlled by Brussels and the Central Bank. I would like to use an example to show that European integration is positive, as is membership of the eurozone. For the explanation I will use the example of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Czechoslovakia split into two new countries. The Czech Republic was created. The republic had 10 million inhabitants and industry was important for it. The GDP was 3.3,000 euros per year. It was also fortunate that the Czech Republic inherited all the cultural institutions that existed in Prague. On the other hand, there was Slovakia with 5 million inhabitants and their industry was also not so developed. The GDP was 2.2,000 euros per year. Bratislava was the capital and became the capital of Slovakia. Both countries developed economically at about the same pace. In 2004 both countries joined the EU and since then they have been able to use EU funds and these funds represent about 2% of GDP. These countries have then approached the European average. The differences between the Czech Republic and Slovakia then became smaller. Slovakia introduced the euro in 2009. The Czech Republic wanted to maintain an independent economic and financial policy. Now I will discuss something that Mr Kobert has already mentioned. The figures speak differently. Between 2009 and 2016, the following happened to the Slovak economy. The economy grew by 1.6% per year. In contrast, the Czech economy grew by only 0.4%. The difference is 1.2% of economic growth. The result was as follows. The difference in GDP per capita between the Czech Republic and Slovakia has decreased. From 21% to 7% in 2015, a reduction of 14% in seven years. During these years, the eurozone had to deal with a major economic crisis, for example. Let's take a look at the crises. The Czech Republic experienced them in 2012 and 2013. Slovakia had this crisis. Even during this crisis, there were good, stable economic results. There are other explanations. One of the explanations is as follows. Czech monetary policy is no longer independent. The Czech Republic also has its place in the European Central Bank. Excuse me. Excuse me. I wanted to say that Slovakia has the position in the Central Bank. Now I would like to quote the book Dilemma not Trillema by Professor Helena Ray. This book is about monetary policy. According to this book, the global financial interest rate will restrict national monetary policy regardless of the exchange rate regime as long as there is free capital. In other words, regardless of whether they are members of the eurozone. If they live in the world, they will always be influenced by it. Let's look at the data from the last five and seven years. Then you come to the conclusion that the development is positive. Thank you.
