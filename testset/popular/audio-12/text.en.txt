 Hello, my name is Marjina Dlabayowa. I am a Member of the European Parliament. I am very happy that I can be here and that I can celebrate the anniversary. I think that we should also remember what values the European Union has and that we should go back to the beginning. So what does the EU mean for the individual and what has the EU given us since the 15 years? So we should remember a little bit. My first memory is very personal. I don't see the EU as an impersonal structure, I see it as a home. I am a proud Czech and I am also a proud European. My first experiences were not Erasmus experiences. I'm not the generation that was able to spend time abroad. But the experience abroad was much more important to me. When I came to Badova at the end of secondary school, I was an extracommunity student, i.e. someone from the EU. I couldn't get a scholarship, a visa or any support. I always had to reapply for a visa and then I had to get a residence permit. So I was a student and it took two years before I could fight for myself. So you had to fight to get a scholarship for students who were not from the EU. So that was the time when Erasmus didn't exist yet. Nowadays, the situation is much easier. You have a very wide range of opportunities. More than 300,000 students have travelled abroad through Erasmus. They are not only university students, but also high school or middle school students or volunteers. I think that's something we should celebrate and something we can see, of course. I also have a memory, because I started a company and also as a person who is not in the EU. My first company was in Italy and you can't imagine how difficult it was to set up a company when you are not in the EU. I first had to set up a company in the Czech Republic and then I was allowed to set up a branch outside the EU as a legal entity. Things have changed over time and I think that the EU has become a part of my life. It was also no coincidence that I wrote a dissertation at university called Home to Europe. And I think that was also the feeling of the time. It also showed how we felt. It was a return to Europe, to home. I would like to mention two big chapters here, the chapters that weigh me down. And they are chapters that we should not repeat in the next 15 years. And it is the freedom of establishment and that is something that is very important. We have the opportunity to travel without borders. And that was also a very big motivation for joining the EU. And that was also a reason why we wanted to join the EU. That's why I think it's a shame that, after 15 years, when I see countries leaving the EU, they forget the principles of what the EU actually supports. Specifically, these are countries that don't want to play along with other countries and they have started to protect their markets from other countries. When I remembered the time when I founded the branch, in Italy in 1994, I had the feeling that we were going back to that time. Because we are limiting freedom and different steps abroad. The first countries that started on this path were England, Germany and France, which started to change this. And they started with the workers and with low wages. Of course, it is not easy to get different things from the companies and also from the workers. And of course it is also important in the context of travelling for work. I think we should be grateful that we have very different economic things. And it also makes the countries more competitive and the countries are of course different in Europe. We have also heard different voices from different countries. And they have talked about the fact that we should be equal in terms of work, wages and opportunities. And opportunities are very important to us. And I think this is missing nowadays. We should avoid the barriers. We should also avoid the barriers in our internal market, because they are very high. And we should not multiply these barriers. So that was a very big chapter that was close to my heart. And I am working on these criteria and I see these problems from close up. The second thing that is close to my heart, which is the matter of the future, is communication. And communication is important for the future, also within the framework of the European Union, because the EU is our future. And we are talking about our own future here. And we should not criticise it. So if we want to criticise, then we should also be part of the common argumentation. And we also need partners we can hold on to. We should not always repeat ourselves. We should say why the EU is important to us. And keep repeating these things. So if we look at our economy, which is very prosperous and very well off. If we also look at the standard of living, which is also very high and growing, then we have all this thanks to the EU. We have the funds from the common budget. We can deal with these things. But unemployment, which is also very low, has also progressed thanks to these funds. Since membership in 2004, we have received more than 741 billion on average than we have given. And we should repeat this to ourselves every day. Even if we have different opinions about these funds, these are funds that we can invest, that we can give to different projects. These projects naturally have added value and they also improve the quality of our lives. The funding should then also be used with a vision. They should also be used effectively. And I think it's not just me who thinks this. But I think we should focus on this. I think we are the biggest EU sceptics, i.e. the Czech Republic. We see that in various statistics, in demonstrations. But I think we are the biggest EU sceptics.
