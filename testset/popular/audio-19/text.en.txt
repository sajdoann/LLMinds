 DW Learn German. Everyday German. The Tobias Brotherhood. More and more people are dying alone. After their death, the commune buries them in mass graves. The Tobias Brotherhood ensures that there is at least one service for the deceased. At the municipal cemetery in Göttingen, twelve men walk silently behind a cart. On it lie five urns of people who were not cared for after their death. Pastor Rudolf Grote says a short prayer at the grave. Eternal God, you do not only see what is before your eyes. You look at the heart. We all hardly know these deceased. But you know them. While the priest reads out the names of the dead, the cheap, black metal urns are lowered into a common grave. No one can see them. No one knows what they looked like. The twelve men, who call themselves the Tobias brothers, throw earth and flower petals onto the urns. They bid farewell to the deceased, who no longer had any relatives and would have been buried anonymously by the municipality had it not been for the Tobias brothers. Harald Storz, pastor of a Göttingen city centre church and Tobias brother, explains what happens afterwards. When enough urns have been collected, a trench is dug with an excavator and that's it. Many people today want to be buried in an urn, i.e. a container with the ashes of the cremated body. A funeral service with family and friends takes place anyway. But if the deceased was lonely, there is no one at the grave except the cemetery gardener. Then an excavator comes and makes a channel, a long trench in the earth. Several metal urns are then placed in the hole. The number of these poor burials in Germany has risen rapidly. Around 10,000 people are affected at the end of their lives every year. And the number is increasing, says Storz. People are getting older and older. This means that more and more people are becoming lonely in old age. And then a situation arises in which a person dies just as lonely as they lived in the last phase of their life and has to be buried just as lonely because there is no one left. When you get very old, family members and friends are often already dead. This leads to or brings with it the fact that you gradually become very lonely. You become lonely. Storz says that the Tobias Brotherhood in Göttingen organises a funeral service every three months so that you are not buried anonymously after your death. The Tobias Brotherhood is an attempt to respond to the situation that there are around 50 to 70 funerals a year in the city of Göttingen, disposing of the bodies of people for whom no one is responsible. And that is why the public order office has to intervene at this point as part of the law on combating epidemics. In Germany, death is also regulated by law. This also includes the disposal of corpses. This means that a deceased person must be buried or cremated. If someone has no relatives, the public order office takes care of this. The office's task is to monitor compliance with public safety and order. However, the employees are not police officers. For example, they register new residents, monitor hygiene in restaurants or ensure that the law on combating epidemics is observed. In other words, they prevent diseases or epidemics from spreading. If someone breaks the law, for example if a corpse is not buried, they have to intervene and prevent the illegal behaviour. The Tobias Brotherhood does not want it to get that far. A brotherhood is a religious community of men with the same charitable or pious aim. In addition to the men of the brotherhood, former neighbours sometimes also come to the funeral services for the unknown dead to say goodbye. Then the song is sung together, Lord, remember the names of those who have died. Wolf-Dietrich Köhler from the Social Science Institute of the Protestant Church appreciates the work of the Tobias brothers. He has analysed poor burials using the city of Hildesheim as an example. For example, there is a church cemetery in the municipality studied that only allows round burials with a slab on the lawn. Whether the slab bears a name or not can then be decided. But it doesn't cost any more or less. And the experience is that since this regulation has been in place, hardly anyone wants to be buried without a name. In other words, none of them wanted to be anonymous. They wanted to be buried cheaply and with low maintenance. And the trend in the local authority surveyed is that cemetery regulations in the church sector are clearly being changed in the direction that anonymous burials should no longer be allowed. So there should be slabs on the lawn. Metal nameplates will be placed on the ground above the buried urns. According to the cemetery regulations, i.e. the rules for burials in a cemetery, this should even become compulsory. Urns are cheaper than coffins because they don't take up as much space. Even if the deceased still has relatives, they don't have to plant two to three metres of soil and keep it clean, but only a very small space above the urn. This is much easier to care for. It's less work. Incidentally, the 30-strong Tobias Brotherhood in Göttingen has a historical role model. Back in the Middle Ages, men joined together in times of war and diseases such as the plague or cholera to bury the deceased who no longer had any relatives. But the brotherhood was not only founded out of a sense of tradition, says Harald Storz, one of the co-founders. Above all, we decided on this form because we realised that men are very, very little involved in diaconal work. And when we realised that we men also shy away a little from voluntary diaconal work, we decided that it made sense to create an area in which there was a specific commitment from men. Women are usually involved in diaconal work. This is the social service of the Protestant church. Here, Christians help people who need help. They work in kindergartens or old people's homes, for example. Men like to avoid this work. They don't join in. The Tobias Brotherhood is different. They have created an area where they can get involved. Incidentally, the name comes from the Bible. In the relatively unknown book of Tobit in the Old Testament, the main character Tobias says: "When I saw that one of my people had died and that his body had been thrown behind the city wall of Nineveh, I buried him." www.dew.deutschlernen Everyday German More on dw.com www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschläischenметz www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschlernen www.dew.deutschl Picasso
