 Where does, say, heroin addiction come from? That's a pretty stupid question, isn't it? It's quite clear, heroin addiction comes from heroin. And it works like this. If you inject heroin for 20 days, you become addicted on the 21st day. This is due to the addictive substances in heroin. They are the cause of the addiction. But wait a minute. In fact, a lot of what we think we know about addiction could be wrong. For example, if you break your hip, in some countries you are given diamorphine in hospital for weeks or even months. Diamorphine is nothing other than heroin. It is even much stronger than the heroin you get on the street because it is not contaminated with extenders. Right now, people in hospitals are being given premium heroin. Surely everyone will become addicted, right? According to research, very few people do. Your grandma didn't become a junkie after her hip operation either. How did that happen? Our current understanding of addiction is based on a series of experiments carried out at the beginning of the 20th century. The design of these experiments is simple. A rat is placed in a cage with two bottles of water. One bottle contains tap water, the other is laced with heroin or cocaine. In this experiment, many rats develop an addiction to the drug water and drink it excessively until they kill themselves with it. But in the 1970s, psychology professor Bruce Alexander noticed something about the experiment. The rats are put into cages one by one. They have nothing but the drugs. So what would happen if you did things differently? He then built a rat park. A true paradise for rats. The rats lived in a lovingly furnished cage with colourful balls and tunnels. They were together with friends with whom they could play or have sex. They were also given a choice of drugged water and tap water. His results were astounding. The rats showed little interest in the drugged water. None of them drank it compulsively or died of an overdose. Although this is only a single animal experiment, there are also some interesting studies on human drug consumption in extreme situations. In the Vietnam War, for example, 20% of American troops regularly used heroin. It was feared that the US would be overrun by hundreds of thousands of junkies after the war ended. But a study conducted after the war showed that the soldiers neither ended up in clinics nor went through withdrawal. 95% simply stopped when they got home. The traditional understanding of addiction alone cannot explain this. Professor Alexander's theory brings us closer. If you are in a dangerous jungle and have to live with the constant fear that you might die or kill another person, then heroin is a tempting pastime. But when you return home to family and friends, it's like going from your first lonely rat cage to rat paradise. Apparently, it's not just the chemicals that play a role, but also the cage. We should take a fresh look at addiction. Humans have an innate need to build close relationships with others. When we are well, it is easy for us to do this. But if we are not doing well, for example if we are traumatised or isolated, we may form a close bond with a substitute object. Some people form a close bond with their mobile phones. For some, it's pornography, a video game, gambling or even cocaine. We form these bonds because it's in our nature. One way out of these unhealthy attachments could be to build close emotional relationships with other people. In this case, addiction becomes a symptom of isolation in our society. For many, it is very real. Since the 1950s, the number of close friends each American has has been steadily decreasing. At the same time, the square footage of their homes is getting bigger. Floor space is becoming more important than friends and things are becoming more important than relationships. The war on drugs that we've been waging for almost 100 years now has only made things worse. Instead of helping people get well and get their lives back on track, they are being marginalised by society. We punish them with benefit cuts and prison if we catch them. We put them in cells, i.e. cages, and make people who are not well feel even worse. And we despise them if they don't improve. We only ever talk about the improvement of the individual and don't see the role of society in this recovery process. Because we are all responsible. Instead, we need to consider the environment of the people affected and not make hasty judgements. Instead of pigeonholing people, we should first listen to them. The first step in the fight against addiction should not be harsh punishment, but empathy.
