 We're all wearing masks at the moment because of the coronavirus. Many have homemade ones made from fabric. And you often see surgical masks. And there are also some in DIY stores that you're supposed to wear when you're making things. And then there are also special FFP masks. And we travelled to Weimar for you to find out how all these masks actually work. And what the difference is between them. At the Bauhaus University. Amayu Wakoya-Gena is doing research there with this mirror. It's a very special mirror. It can be used to visualise things that are otherwise invisible. It's also called a schlieren mirror. It comes with a camera and other technology. And when Amayu Wakoya looks at me in front of the mirror with the camera, he suddenly sees this kind of wobble in the mirror. Or streaks like that. Hence the name, Schlierenspiegel. And so that you can see it even better, he switches off the light while watching. You can see how air moves. And it moves when it's warm, for example. You can see that here. My body heats up the air around it. And it then rises upwards in streaks like this. And even when I breathe, the air I exhale is warmer than the air in the lab. That's why you can suddenly see my breath in the mirror. You can see how far the airflow is blown when I breathe out. And I also exhale droplets of moisture with my breath. Larger and tiny ones. And viruses or bacteria could be attached to them if I have them in my body. And so I could make others ill, even if I don't want to. And when I cough now, I throw these tiny particles extra far around. You can see it pretty well with this streak mirror. What happens when I put on my homemade fabric mask? The mask slows down the air. And the breath doesn't go as far. And it doesn't travel as far when I cough either. However, air also comes out of the top and bottom of the mask. It's like breathing through a sieve. The sieve slows down my air and also retains many droplets. And depending on what the mask is made of, for example, it can also protect me from droplets from other people. And Oliver Meckes shows us that the fabric really is something of a sieve. He has a very special microscope. A scanning electron microscope. He can use it to visualise this. This is what the cotton fabric of my mask looks like when greatly magnified. Oliver has coloured it so you can see everything even more clearly. The fabric looks like a grid and there are always holes like this in between. That's because this fabric was woven. And this is what it looks like on a loom. The blue threads lie in one direction and a white thread is laid between them in the other direction. So the threads are all crossed and there is a hole between them. And these light brown particles are pollen. And Oliver placed them on top as an example, so that very small particles such as viruses or bacteria could get through. And that wouldn't be so good, of course. This large system therefore makes something without holes. It's made from these white plastic beads. You can see them in that grey part there. And first they are melted in the long box so that they are really liquid. In English, this is called melting. And the liquid then runs through this silver tube. And then comes out of this slit again. Like a kind of waterfall. And so that the plastic soup doesn't cool down immediately, it is blown with hot air from the right and left. This is called blowing. And what then lands on the black conveyor belt is called a meltblown fleece. Just like chewing gum, the beads are stretched out. In the factory, this happens by making them liquid and from the slit trap. The result is very thin fibres. And you can stretch such a bead so long that the fibre reaches from the castle back there to me here in front. That's three and a half kilometres. From one such granule. Hard to believe. And so the fibres that end up on the conveyor belt are incredibly fine. And because they are blown on by the hot air, they whirl and spin wildly on their way down. And when they land, it's like the spaghetti here. They end up criss-crossed and on top of each other on the plate, covering it almost completely. And because the fibres are naturally much finer than the spaghetti, the meltblown fleece is a really closed surface on the conveyor belt. When the fibres cool down, they really stick together. And the result is a long web. This is what the web looks like under a scanning electron microscope. You can really see the many fine plastic fibres lying on top of each other. And the pollen that we saw at the beginning can no longer get through, it gets caught in this tangle. And even much, much smaller particles such as viruses can't get through. Because the fleece is made of plastic, it can be electrically charged. Let me show you with this balloon. When I rub it, it attracts my hair. And also this paper confetti. And the meltblown also attracts viruses and bacteria and doesn't let them through. The only problem is that the meltblown fleece breaks very quickly. And that's why something else is made from the plastic balls on another machine. Fibres again. But these are thicker and much more stable. This is also used to make another long web. And under the microscope you can see that the fibres are much thicker and fused together in some places so that everything holds together. This is what this stuff looks like. It's called spunbond. And you all have it at home. It's used to make cleaning cloths, for example. Or suits so that you don't get soaked when painting. And even hoover bags have a sturdy cover made of spunbond. And if you take that and put a layer of meltblown on top and then another layer of spunbond, you have a medical face mask or surgical mask. I cut it open again to see if it's right. There's the spunbond, then a layer of meltblown and then the spunbond again. That's why it's also called SMS. And under the microscope you can see how thin the fibres of the meltblown are and how thick the fibres of the spunbond, which are supposed to protect the meltblown layer, are. So, now I want to see what this mask does when I breathe. I'm curious. When I breathe, the air moves even less forwards. Here's a comparison with the homemade mask on the right. The surgical mask also holds the airflow a little better when coughing. But with both masks, a lot of air escapes upwards and downwards. So Amayo Vakuya turns me round again so that I'm now sitting with my back to the mirror. And then you can see how the air is blown out to the right and left. You can see this even more clearly when you cough. That's because these surgical masks don't fit so tightly. They are mainly made to catch droplets or splashes that come out of the mouth and nose. But now there's another type of mask. The FFP masks. They can look like this, for example. They fit very tightly. That's why it's quite a fiddle to put them on. And if you watch them in front of the Schlieren mirror, you can see that even less gets through. Here's another comparison with the homemade mask. You can also see it when you cough. And how does the mask do that? Oliver makes a cross-section of it so that he can look at it from the side. A look at the FFP mask shows that it has many more layers of meltblown fleece. There are five here and even seven in another. The reason for using different numbers of layers is that there are different types of these masks. So, an FFP-1 mask must not allow more than 20 of 100 particles in the air to pass through. You can buy an FFP-1 mask like this in DIY stores, for example. You can use it if you are sanding something and don't want to breathe in the dust. An FFP 2 mask only allows six out of 100 particles in the air to pass through. So it's much, much thicker. And the tightest is an FFP 3 mask. Only one particle in 100 can get through. FFP 2 and 3 masks like these are mainly needed by people who work in hospitals, for example. If they are treating someone who has severe flu or the new coronavirus, then of course they should not become infected and should be as well protected as possible. But if you look again at how far breath is carried without a mask, you can clearly see how well even a homemade mask can protect against your own droplets being thrown around. And depending on what it's made of and how it's made, it can probably also help to protect yourself a little better. So it's definitely a good idea to wear one.
