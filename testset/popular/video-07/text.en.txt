 Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. I think we are talking today about an issue that is of the utmost importance to citizens. We have a beautiful Europe in which people are moving more and more. We have a Europe in which more and more binational marriages are taking place, or couples are moving to another country. And that is a wonderful thing. That is the success of the European Union. But unfortunately, this success also has a downside: these marriages keep breaking up. And then it's about the divorces that have to take place. And the law that we have today is sometimes so unfortunate that it can happen that a couple cannot find a competent judge or law after which they can get divorced. And that is of course a very unpleasant situation for these citizens. And we have to remedy this and give them an answer, because this is about people's actual lives. And that is of the utmost importance. I am therefore delighted that the European Commission has tackled this issue. And I wanted to say once again in advance that we are not harmonising the law on this issue. Absolutely not. Nor should we. It is clearly stated in the Treaties of the European Union, of the European Communities, that the law in these matters is a matter for the Member States. But we must ensure that there is transparency so that citizens can make use of this right. And the law is very different. We have Malta, where there is no divorce at all. On the other hand, there is Sweden, where you can get divorced within six months. We have the Netherlands, where there are marriages for homosexuals, while in Poland it is unimaginable that such a thing exists. These are all questions that we have to answer. And I think we have done a good job in the European Parliament. In good co-operation with the European Commission, but also with the Council. It depends on the Council, which has to decide unanimously what we will do in this area in future. Unfortunately, there is a problem at the moment, but I will come back to that later. The answers that the European Commission has proposed to us are very positive. On the one hand, it wants to increase the choice of options if both parties in the couple agree on the law under which they want to divorce. Whereby it is quite clear that there must be a reference point to their lives, to the place of residence, the place of marriage or other reference points so that this can actually be applied. There is also the question of what happens if a couple want to divorce, or only one of them, and cannot agree on the law to be applied. Here we say that the freedom of choice cannot be so great, because we have to ensure that there is a catalogue. We cannot accept forum shopping. We cannot accept a free choice where the stronger party in the partnership chooses which law is the most favourable for me and the other party is at a disadvantage. We cannot accept that. That's why we have two different answers to these questions. But one thing clearly applies to both, and it is particularly important. We must ensure that both partners are very well informed about the consequences, both social and legal, of the choice of law. This is about custody issues. It's about alimony and all these issues, which are also connected in this case. They need to know that before they make a decision. And we demand that the judges really check that they also know what the consequences of this choice are. It is also important that we prevent the use of a law that comes from somewhere that would not be acceptable according to the principles of the European Union. I'm thinking of Sharia law, Chinese law or whatever. And here we have also found clear formulations, which we have written into motions 25 and 30 in particular, which I have tried to reinforce in my motion number 36, that the law in force must actually only be able to comply with the fundamental principles of the European Union. Otherwise, no such law can be applied. That is quite clear to us. I would also like to reiterate this very clearly on behalf of the PPE-DE, which has tabled a number of amendments that I absolutely cannot accept. This is because they impose a total restriction on what we already have today and would also contravene international law as we have it today, as we have it in the Hague on income, for example, and in other areas. We cannot accept that. I think we need to talk about this again. And I hope that we will still manage to find a solution to the problem by tomorrow. In any case, thank you, Mr Demetrio, for the way you are working with me. That is very positive. But as I said, the Council has a big problem. It has to decide unanimously. And there is one state that is currently simply preventing this unanimity from being achieved. And that is why we in our committee have put this oral question to the Council and the European Commission. I find it very regrettable that the Council is not here now to answer this question. The Minister has just left. Because it is essential for us, for the future of the European Union, for the citizens to know what we are doing now. Firstly, the question to the European Commission. Mr Barrault, I am delighted that you are here to answer the question. Whether you intend to withdraw your proposal. And secondly, whether you intend, in accordance with Article 11 of the EC Treaty and in line with Articles 43 and 45 of the Treaty, to submit a proposal to the Council to establish an enhanced cooperation procedure. And I would very much like to know from the Council whether it actually intends to go down this route. Because that is the big question that arises. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Thank you very much.
