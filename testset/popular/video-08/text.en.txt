 Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The Gulf of Mexico was probably one of the biggest environmental disasters of recent years. And we in Europe, in the European Union, must do everything we can to prevent such a disaster from happening here. I believe there is unanimity on this. We have four seas that border the EU or lie within the EU. The North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. And oil drilling is taking place in these European waters. In this respect, this is also a problem for the European Union. Deep-sea drilling in particular is a special risk. We saw that with the oil well in the Gulf of Mexico. There are problems there that are not under control. And a whole series of unanswered questions have arisen where there are still no answers. And that is why, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we agreed with you in our resolution that it would be appropriate to declare a moratorium at least on new applications for deep-sea drilling until we have a complete overview of what is needed and how the deficits and gaps can be closed. I believe that the citizens of Europe also expect us to ensure that safety in all 27 member states, i.e. in all four seas of the EU, is at the same high level. And that we do not have a disparity between countries that are already doing a lot, and that should also be recognised, and perhaps regions where this issue is dealt with somewhat more carelessly. I am also referring to the neighbourhood. We have a neighbourhood policy and, above all in the Mediterranean, there are of course also wells drilled by countries that are not members of the European Union. Commissioner Oettinger, I believe that you are taking initiatives and must take them in order to discuss our standards and our ideas with Libya in particular, but also with others. The question is, would the EU be prepared for such a disaster? So what is the control mechanism? What is the intervention mechanism? Should we have such a disaster? That also needs to be answered. We have the agency here in Lisbon, the European Maritime Safety Agency, which was created as a result of a disaster involving large tankers breaking up. And the agency checks the safety of ships, but not the safety of the seas. In other words, what we have now seen with the deep-sea drilling. And we believe that it would be a good idea if the mandate of the Emser in Lisbon were extended and they could also take care of these things. That would at least be close to the problem and adequate. I can imagine that new resources would then also be needed. That is always a problem. But if we want to tackle such a major issue, the resources would have to be created. I would also like to mention the liability for such major events. What does the insurance actually look like? What is the possibility of raising the necessary money for this? We also need to get an overview of the liability and insurance law for deep-sea oil drilling. That's what we're talking about. And above all, of course, what the situation is like for smaller companies that are active in this area. It's not just the multinationals. There are also many small companies. How can they cope? How can they insure themselves? Do they need solidarity funds? Are collective solutions needed so that the victims can also get their money? The fishermen, others who are affected by such disasters. We also want to know whether the environmental impact directive, the environmental impact assessment that we demand on land, also applies to deep-sea drilling and what is involved. And there is a lot that is not known on the high seas. What are the working conditions, the social standards? Because the human factor can also play a major role. You have good technology, but if the human factor fails, disasters like this can occur. Yes, all in all, Commissioner, you are responsible for energy. Let me finish. Offshore oil has its problems. Offshore wind would be better. And I believe that this debate naturally opens the way for a different energy policy in the EU, for which you also bear responsibility. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
