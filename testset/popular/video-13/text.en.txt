 Hello, I would like to give a short speech today on the subject of micro-apartments and the speech is very simple. I'm not going to use a lot of terminology. I'll start with the speech now. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure you're all aware of the problem. Living in cities is generally becoming more and more expensive and this affects all areas of life. You have to dig deeper and deeper into your pockets when you pay for your daily shopping at the supermarket checkout, for example, or when you go to the cinema. But one area is particularly affected by these rising prices. Housing. No matter whether you are in Paris, London or Milan. The picture is the same everywhere. Flats at affordable prices have become a rarity. Young people in particular often don't know how they can afford the rent for a flat. In my opinion, this is why alternative forms of housing are becoming increasingly important. And as I mentioned at the beginning, I will briefly talk about micro-apartments and micro-living. This concept originally comes from Asia, but it is also becoming increasingly popular in Europe. Micro-apartments are nothing more than flats in miniature format. In extreme cases, these are seven to eight square metres and the price for such a flat is 100 to 200 euros. This may sound like utopia, but architects have actually succeeded in creating a flat in such a small space that also has a bathroom and a kitchen, albeit of course in modest dimensions. Everything is organised to save space in such flats. The tables and bed, for example, are concealed in the wall and can be folded out when required. Of course, you don't have to do without a television or wardrobe either. What you won't find in such a flat, however, is luxury. Only the bare essentials are provided. At this point, we could also speak of a purist form of living. One person can still live in such a flat without any problems and there are even larger versions if they want to live together with their partner, for example. In many cities, such as Vienna, there are already concrete plans for houses with micro-apartments, and not just on the outskirts somewhere, but right in the centre of the city. In my opinion, there has already been a rethink among the population. Nowadays, it is no longer considered chic to have as large a flat as possible, but rather something small and refined. So you see, ladies and gentlemen, there is a solution to every problem. Sometimes you just have to be a little creative. This is a political form of reminded attesting of the 2007 greines hair, complete on the year 2020. So, go lớn and experiment with Angelatin. Then win this with 1 1.つ K profitable with the 2 2.
