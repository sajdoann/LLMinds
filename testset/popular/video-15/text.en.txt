 Ladies and gentlemen, I have prepared a second topic, a very special topic that is certainly surprising in this context. It is about a Benedictine monastery. This monastery is also located in Styria, the place where Graz is situated, in the north of Styria, in what is known as Upper Styria. The monastery is called Atmund. Many monasteries have very large libraries in which you can also find many old manuscripts. Such libraries can be a real treasure trove. There is someone in Atmund who likes to rummage through the local archives of the monastery and this gentleman recently made a sensational find. He was rummaging through the folder labelled B, which contained various fragments. Under a pile of such fragments, he discovered two pieces of parchment the size of a palm. The gentleman I'm talking about is a handwriting expert and he immediately realised that these objects must be very old. I have a French friend who is a historian and teaches here at the University of Luxembourg. She specialises in the Middle Ages. So she is, as they say, a medievalist. When she heard about this find, she became almost hysterically excited. It's every historian's dream to make a find like this. It's madness. What could be seen on these pieces of parchment? On these pieces of parchment, sorry, maybe I can show them too. I have an Austrian magazine here in which an article was published about this find. On these pieces of parchment you can see lists of words written in accurate, old, Carolingian script. On the left-hand side are Latin terms in alphabetical order. Next to them are words that do not sound Latin, but are Old High German. So this is the oldest form of the written German language. And these words appear to be the equivalent of the Latin terms on the left. Such alphabetical word lists were very rare in the Middle Ages. The researcher who discovered these pieces of parchment in Admund photographed the fragments and sent digital copies to a colleague. This colleague said that we should take a closer look. Transcriptions were made, the writing and vocabulary were analysed, the pieces of parchment were compared with other manuscripts and the material was examined. Today, experts are electrified by this find. This fragment, which lay unnoticed for a long time, is an extremely early version of the so-called Abrogans. And the Abrogans is the oldest book in the German language. The Abrogans, a Latin word, is a manuscript that is more than 1200 years old. It is based on a Latin dictionary of synonyms. The whole list begins with the word Abrogans and that is why this manuscript is called that. In the abrogans, rarely used Latin terms are first explained using simpler Latin words, i.e. synonyms. And then they are translated into German, at that time into Old High German. We can say that the Abrogans was something like an early medieval Langenscheid. We know today that not only difficult terms, but also common terms were contained in this dictionary, organised according to ABC, explained and translated into German. The original Abrogans was probably written in the Bavarian town of Freising around the year 770. It has not been preserved. But we have three copies. One of them is in St Gallen in Switzerland, the second in the National Library in Paris and the third in Karlsruhe. All three copies were made at the turn of the 8th and 9th centuries, i.e. around the year 800. This find in Admont is probably the fourth copy of this abrogation. And a find like this is very, very rare today. It offers very valuable insights into the early history of the German language and script and into the working methods of monastic scripturias. For example, it also contains names of animals. The word Kupilia, mole, Kulix, mosquito. Today, a word processing programme would sort word lists alphabetically in a few microseconds. But back then, it took the monks many months. They had to go through the entire codex of more than 3600 word pairs again and again, searching word by word to organise everything according to the ABC. It also had to be sorted according to the second letter, i.e. A, B, A, C, A, D and so on. And it also had to be noted down again and again. But parchment was out of the question because it was too valuable. Wax was probably used for these intermediate notes. The fragment found in Admon was written on calfskin. Iron ink was used as the writing fluid. I will soon come to the end. It is possible that the monks were working on behalf of Charlemagne, who ruled the Frankish Empire at the time. Charlemagne wanted to introduce a legible script, the Carolingian script, and wanted to use it to write down the vernacular. That was his strategic plan. After all, a standardised language and script could facilitate indigeneity. He had sample translations made from Latin into German and was keen to spread education. It is therefore quite possible that this Admont find was a dictionary commissioned by Charlemagne. I am not an expert on the Middle Ages, but when I imagine how the monks painstakingly wrote a kind of first early medieval Langenscheid more than 1200 years ago, I get really excited. Thank you very much for your attention.
