 Music When I was a child, there were no toy shops. Cologne was totally destroyed. There weren't even any houses. Nevertheless, we children played back then, of course. But in a completely different way. We played at collecting wood, for example. We had other things to worry about. For example, like here in Berlin, the adults chopped down the street trees to have something to burn. They sawed them up. The children sometimes sawed them up too. And the little ones collected wood. That was our game. Collecting wood. So that it was warm in the hut. Another favourite game was coal claw. Incidentally, the children had a particular advantage when it came to stealing coal. Of course, stealing coal was forbidden. And people were often shot when coal was stolen. Only children were not shot at. And that's why we children had an advantage. So when it came to stealing coal, we children were always in the front line. Didn't you have any toys? Well, there were hardly any toys. And when we did, we only had homemade ones. Like this little sheep here. Someone had built it. A little stick at the bottom to support it. Anyone who had something like this was very proud. Some father or uncle or someone who was skilful had made it. Sawed out with a fretsaw or carved. Or someone brought it back from captivity. Like this duck with a foot underneath. Something was made out of some scraps. If you had four animals like that, then you could play farm. Then you were incredibly proud. Because it was incredibly rare to have something like that. We often played haul stones. Or tidying up. And it didn't matter whether you were young or a girl. Everyone had to get stuck in, with tippy ears. Or when there was free time, there was also a favourite game. Throwing stones into the puddle. And then climbing over it like a bridge. That was great too. Toys were usually made out of something. This one was made from a cigar box and some sticky tape. A hut. And special luxuries. On a chain that might have once hung from a loo. A dog. Dog on a chain in front of a doghouse. Toy 1946, self-made. The rubble was also a favourite playground. The older boys used to dig up grenades. Insanely dangerous. Many lost their hands or died in the process. But digging through the rubble and finding something was great, of course. If you found a crate like that, for example, some of the boys or their fathers or mothers would build little trolleys out of it. There was always something going on in the rubble. This is a bent iron beam. That's not a doll, it's a little girl sliding. So, slide 1946, adventure playground 1946, skilful fathers made something out of everything. One of them made a horse with wheels. The wheels are money. The money was worth nothing, but it was great for playing. Or a swing made from an aeroplane cockpit, from a jettisoned plane. Or rows of rings. But I think it looks very built up. The photographer helped with that. There were also a few toys that only girls played with back then. So this is a gas mask box. And there's a doll's pram in there. Here it comes. A doll's pram with a doll. Built from a few scraps of wood. The doll too. A bit of wood, a few scraps of fabric. Toys made by myself in 1946. Anyone who had something like that was very happy. Because there was nothing else. Or anyone who had a doll like that, for example. That was a real world champion. Even if this doll had no eyes. And the head was a little bit broken. Anyone who rescued or found something like this never let it go. Like this girl here. But even more important was the milk crane to collect something. The toy thing only ended when the children in the American schools collected toys for us German children. Toys that we had never seen before came in small boxes. Suddenly there were real dolls. Or sometimes even whistles. We had never seen anything like that before.
