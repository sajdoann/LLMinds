Metabolism and energy conversion in the human body


Nutrition and metabolism


4


Before moving on to the study of metabolism in the human body, recall the features of metabolism in plants. How do they obtain energy for their vital processes? And how do animals obtain this energy?


Why is nutrition needed? The human body is made up of various substances, most of which are organic. Like any animal organism, the human body is not able to independently form organic substances from inorganic ones. Therefore, to build its body, a person must obtain these substances from the environment, that is, together with food. In addition, the body needs energy to carry out the corresponding biochemical reactions.


Metabolism A large number of chemical reactions occur in the human body. As a result, many different substances are formed and destroyed. The totality of these transformations is called metabolism. Metabolism is a set of changes that occur with substances from the moment they enter the body from the environment to the moment the final decay products are formed and they are excreted from the body (Fig. 4.1).
Metabolic processes can be divided into two large groups.
The first of these is a set of processes that result in

to form organic compounds necessary for the vital activity of cells. These processes are called assimilation. During assimilation, the body spends energy. The second group is a set of processes that result in the breakdown of organic compounds into simpler substances. They are called dissimilation. During the dissimilation process, the human body accumulates energy.


Energy conversion in the human body
Organic substances used by the body to obtain energy are transported to the body's cells. There, in special organelles - mitochondria, they are oxidized. For this, oxygen is used, which enters the human body during respiration. Strictly speaking, this is the same reaction that occurs when firewood burns in a bonfire. However, in mitochondria, a significant part of the energy generated during this reaction is not released in the form of heat, but is stored in the form of energy of chemical bonds of certain substances (such as ATP). When energy is required for the course of reactions in cells, such bonds are broken down, releasing the necessary energy.


Substances that enter our body with food are used to provide the human body with energy and build its body. The set of processes of substance transformations in the body is called metabolism..Topic 1


Food and its components


5


Before moving on to the study of food components, remember why our body needs food. What is the set of substance transformations in the body called? What cell organelles provide energy storage?


Food components The main groups of substances that participate in metabolism in the human body are proteins, fats, carbohydrates, inorganic compounds (water and minerals), vitamins. They are contained in almost all
foods in different quantities (Fig. 5.1).
For normal functioning of the body, a person needs a certain amount of substances from each of these groups. Both a deficiency and an excess of any of them can harm health. That is why food must be diverse in order to provide all the body's needs.


Proteins Proteins are organic molecules consisting of amino acid residues that are connected together in the form of a chain.


Confectionery and baked goods are products with the highest carbohydrate content.


Many water-soluble vitamins are found in fruits and vegetables.


Meat, fish, eggs will enrich your body with proteins.


The main sources of minerals are table salt, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, etc.


Fats are found in butter, oils, nuts

Proteins are part of the tissues of the internal environment, participate in the formation of the skeleton, ligaments, skin, hair and other structures. They catalyze (accelerate) biochemical reactions; regulate metabolism; ensure the transfer of oxygen, organic and inorganic compounds in the body. Proteins also form complexes with foreign proteins, inactivating (disabling) them, and participate in the process of blood clotting. They provide muscle contraction and the creation of a reserve of substances necessary for the body. One of the most important groups of proteins in the body are enzymes - proteins that are capable of accelerating chemical reactions occurring in cells by many thousands of times (Fig. 5.2). They work only under certain conditions (temperature, salinity, etc.) and usually catalyze a single reaction. However, they can accelerate this reaction by millions of times! Interestingly, many enzymes in the body are needed to activate other enzymes. Among foods, meat, fish, and eggs (especially egg white) contain a large amount of protein.


Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are organic compounds that, together with proteins,
form complex complexes on the cell membrane. These complexes transmit
various signals from its surface into the cell. Carbohydrates are also involved in creating a reserve of substances necessary for the body, for example, they accumulate in the liver. Carbohydrates are an important source of energy that the cell can very quickly obtain from its reserves. They form the basis of such food products as honey, sweets, cakes, pastries, as well as bread, potatoes, borscht, semolina.


FatsFats are a large group of water-insoluble organic substances.Fats participate in the formation of the cell membrane and intracellular membranes. They perform the functions of hormones, vitamins and protective substances. Fats also provide a reserve of substances necessary for the body.


19. Topic 1


These compounds make up the bulk of milk, lard, nuts. Fats are sunflower oil and butter.


Water and mineralsWater is a universal solvent: it is able to dissolve most substances in the human body. Water participates in the formation of the internal environment of individual cells and the body as a whole, creates an environment for the course of biochemical reactions. Minerals form the basis of the skeleton, play an important role in the functioning of cells. Thus, Sodium and Potassium ions ensure the passage of nerve impulses through the nervous tissue, and inorganic Calcium compounds ensure bone strength. Vitamins


Vitamins
include organic substances of different composition and properties that the body needs in small quantities, but without which its vital activity is impossible. Most of them are part of enzymes. By solubility, vitamins are divided into two large groups - water-soluble and fat-soluble. More detailed information about vitamin groups is given in the table.


The importance of some vitamins


Vitamin Functions in the body


Water-soluble vitamins


Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) Participates in the synthesis of proteins and the formation of organic matter in bones, increases immunity


Thiamine (vitamin B 1 ) Participates in the metabolism of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, conduction of excitation in the nervous system


Riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ) Participates in reactions necessary for the synthesis of enzymes


Nicotinic acid (vitamin PP) Participates in important metabolic reactions


Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6 )
Participates in the metabolism of skin proteins, the functioning of nervous system cells and hematopoiesis


Cobalamin (vitamin B 12 ) Participates in important metabolic reactions, hematopoiesis


Fat-soluble vitamins


Retinol (vitamin A) Participates in many processes: metabolism, growth, reproduction, vision


Calciferol (vitamin D) Participates in the regulation of calcium metabolism


20. Food and its Components


How to preserve vitamins in food Fresh foods contain the largest amount of vitamins. Any method of cooking food reduces the amount of vitamins in it, but this happens to different degrees. In fresh foods, vitamins are best preserved at a temperature of about 0 º C. In addition to temperature, light also affects the preservation of vitamins: it, like oxygen in the air, stimulates the oxidation of these substances. Therefore, for example, sunflower oil, which contains, say, fat-soluble vitamin E, should be stored in an opaque, hermetically sealed container. The content of vitamins in products is significantly reduced when they
are cut, dried, and stored in metal containers.
Long-term preservation of vitamins in berries is ensured by grinding them with sugar. However, it is preferable to grind them not with metal, but with wooden pestles. By choosing a certain method of cooking, you can also reduce the loss of vitamins. Most of them are lost during cooking, so the cooking time should be minimal. Vitamins are best preserved when baking in the oven and steaming. Vegetables that contain vitamins are better cooked whole - this way they lose them less.


With food, the human body receives substances necessary for its vital activity. These are proteins, carbohydrates, fats, water, minerals, etc. Each of these groups of substances performs important functions in the body. Vitamins are of great importance. They are needed in small quantities, but without them, normal metabolism is impossible..topic 1


Human nutritional and energy needs


6


Before moving on to the study of human nutritional and energy needs, remember how animals get energy for their vital activity. And where do plants get energy from? What do you think the human body can spend energy on?


Human energy needs Any activity of the body is accompanied by energy expenditure. Therefore, a person must replenish the energy reserves
of his body every day. It is clear that under different conditions, energy expenditure
will be different. Sedentary work requires less energy expenditure than a tourist hike in the mountains. Energy expenditure is also affected by factors such as gender, age, body weight, etc. Accordingly, the recovery of these expenses will be different for different people. Moreover, the energy needs of the same person can be different every day! Thus, mental work with little physical exertion requires an average of 167.4 kJ of energy per 1 kg of body weight per day, and heavy physical work requires 255.2 kJ of energy per 1 kg of body weight per day.


Human nutritional needs In the human body, a certain part of the cells constantly dies. They are replaced by new cells formed by division. To create new cells, the human body must receive a certain amount of substances every day. It can independently convert some organic substances into others, but this is not always possible. In the process of metabolism, the human body can synthesize some amino acids from other organic compounds. However, not all of them: certain amino acids in proteins are indispensable, and they enter our body only with food. Other organic substances are also indispensable, which a person can obtain only from the external environment. Therefore, not only the total amount, but also the composition of food is important for human nutrition (Fig. 6.1 on p. 24). The quantitative characteristics of human nutritional needs can be found in the table.

60–10 240–97 Vitamin Deficiency The deficiency or absence of vitamins in food leads to extremely negative consequences. The phenomenon of vitamin deficiency is called hypovitaminosis, while their complete absence is called avitaminosis. These disorders are not always associated with malnutrition, but rather with a lack of certain vitamins. Learn about the consequences of such a deficiency from the table.

Excess vitamins


Excessive intake of vitamins into the body - hypervitaminosis - also leads to negative consequences. Most often, hypervitaminosis is caused by an excess of fat-soluble vitamins. This is due to the fact that they are much more difficult to remove from the body through the kidneys than water-soluble compounds. Excessive intake of vitamin preparations can lead to hypervitaminosis. In the case of prolonged intake of a significant amount of vitamins, even water-soluble vitamins can cause disorders. The consequences of hypervitaminosis are described in the table.


Consequences of excess vitamins


Vitamin Causes of hypervitaminosis Consequences of hypervitaminosis


Vitamin A Excessive consumption of vitamin preparations, fish, seafood, carrots


Skin rash, itching, headache, joint pain, fever, kidney dysfunction


Vitamin D Excessive consumption of vitamin preparations, fish, seafood Headache, weakness, nausea, indigestion, loss of appetite, joint pain


24. Nutritional and energy needs of a person


Balanced nutrition A person's need for nutrients and energy is determined by such factors as his body weight, age, level of physical activity. It is obvious that if a person consumes too much food, his body weight will increase, respectively, if there is not enough or too much of individual substances in food, then the person's metabolism will be disturbed, which will lead to a deterioration
in health. To prevent this, you should follow
the rules of a balanced diet and maintain the body's energy balance. A balanced diet is a diet in which the body receives all the nutrients, vitamins and mineral salts from food in the amount necessary for normal life. Energy balance is the ratio of energy entering the body with food and energy expended as a result of the body's activity.


To ensure the vital activity of his body, a person must consume a certain amount of nutrients every day. These substances provide the body with energy and are materials for its construction. To avoid negative consequences, a person must eat a balanced diet..Generalization on the topic "Metabolism and energy conversion in the human body"
