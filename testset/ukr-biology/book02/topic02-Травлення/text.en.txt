Before proceeding to the study of the human digestive system, remember the structure of the digestive system of various animals. How can nutritional features affect the structure of the digestive system?


Structure of the digestive system The digestive system can be conventionally depicted as a tube that runs through the entire human body. Digestive processes occur in this system. Digestion is the process of breaking down complex organic substances into simple soluble compounds that can be absorbed and assimilated by the body. Digestion can occur only with the participation of enzymes. The digestive system consists of several sections (departments) and a number of glands (Fig. 7.1). Its departments are the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, which end with the anus. Why does the digestive system need separate sections? They are needed in order to divide the substances of the consumed food into fragments that the body can then use. The processes that occur in each section must be carried out under certain conditions. These
conditions are provided by substances produced by the digestive glands.
For example, hydrochloric acid is secreted in the stomach, which creates an acidic environment for the work of stomach enzymes. And, for example, the enzymes of the oral cavity and intestines require an alkaline environment to work, so their glands secrete completely different substances. The wall of the digestive tube consists of several layers, each of which performs its function. Thus, the mucous layer facilitates the passage of

The oral cavity is limited by the jaws and lined with a multilayered epithelium. It begins with the mouth opening, through which food enters the body. The oral cavity also contains teeth (20 milk teeth or 32 permanent teeth), tongue (moves food, contains taste receptors), three pairs of salivary glands and buccal glands. The esophagus is a muscular tube through which food enters the stomach from the oral cavity.


The large
intestine is
the area of absorption of water and accumulation of undigested substances. The rectum is the area of excretion of undigested residues from the body

Teeth
There are four types of teeth in humans: 1) incisors (have one root, they bite off food); 2) canines (have one root, they bite off food); 3) small canines (have several roots, they grind food); 4) large canines (have several roots, they grind food). An adult has 8 incisors, 4 canines, 8 small and 12 large canines (Fig. 7.2). Incisors and canines are similar in shape (they are chisel-shaped) and have sharp edges, which makes it possible to bite off food with them. Small and large canines have

a flattened surface with small tubercles. This allows them to grind and grind food very effectively. Milk teeth are only found in children. They are represented by incisors, canines and large canines. After the child's jaws grow, milk teeth fall out and are replaced by permanent ones. A tooth consists of several main components (Fig. 7.3–7.4). The crown of the tooth is covered by enamel from above. Under the enamel is dentin, which forms a large part of the crown, neck and root. The neck and root are covered by cementum, and the tooth cavity is filled with pulp. Blood capillaries and nerves are located in the pulp.

The stomach is an expanded section of the digestive
tract where food is stored and digested. It is covered with a simple cylindrical epithelium, and its wall contains gastric glands that secrete mucus, digestive enzymes and hormones that regulate the digestive process. The wall of the stomach is formed by three layers of smooth muscles. The entrance and exit openings of this section are closed by ring muscles - sphincters. The epithelial cells of the stomach produce a lot of mucus, which protects its walls from the action of digestive enzymes and does not allow the stomach to digest itself.


Intestine The intestine is the longest section of the digestive system. It is divided into two large sections - the small and large intestines. The small intestine consists of three sections - the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The ducts of the liver and the subgastric gland open into the duodenum. The mucous membrane of the small intestine forms many finger-like outgrowths (villi), which contain a large number of lymphatic vessels and blood capillaries. The cells that form the outgrowths are covered with microvilli. This structure of the mucous membrane allows you to significantly increase the area of


the


upper wall of the intestine, which increases the efficiency of absorption of digestive products. The large intestine, as the name suggests, is thicker and shorter than the small intestine. It does not have villi, but there is a large number
of microorganisms that form the intestinal microflora. The final
section of the large intestine is the rectum. It accumulates food residues and products of digestion, which are excreted from the body through the anus.


Glands The walls of the digestive tract contain a lot of small glands. They secrete mucus, digestive enzymes and other substances. The largest glands of the digestive system are the liver and the pancreas. The liver produces bile, which facilitates the digestion of fats. In addition, it neutralizes dangerous substances that enter the body. The pancreas produces a large number of enzymes that ensure the digestive process in the small intestine.


The liver is the largest human gland. Its mass can reach 1500 g


. The digestive system is a system of organs that ensures the process of digestion. It has the form of a tube that begins at the mouth and ends at the anus. It includes digestive glands - the liver, pancreas, salivary glands, etc. Different parts of the digestive system differ in structure and perform different functions.


.TOPIC 2


How the digestive system works


8


Before moving on to studying the processes
occurring in the human digestive system, recall
the organs that are part of this system. What departments is the human digestive system divided into? What glands secrete substances into the digestive system?


Teeth


Tongue


Oral cavity


Digestive processes in the oral cavity The process of digestion begins in the oral cavity (Fig. 8.1): food is crushed and processed by saliva. In order for saliva to process food well, it must be chewed thoroughly. Saliva moistens food, and its amylase enzyme breaks down carbohydrates into components. Saliva also contains the enzymes lipase and maltase, which break down organic substances, lysozyme, which disinfects food, and mucin, which ensures the formation of a food lump. As you already know, in the oral cavity, food is ground and ground by the teeth. After chewing and mixing with the tongue, it turns into a food lump, which is further advanced through the digestive system due to the contractions of the smooth muscles in the walls of the digestive tract. After grinding food and processing it with saliva, swallowing occurs. Swallowing is a set of movements of the muscles of the oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus, which ensure the movement of food from the oral cavity through the pharynx and esophagus to the stomach.


Esophagus


Digestive processes in the stomach In the stomach (Fig. 8.2), food is processed by gastric juice, a liquid secreted by the glands of the stomach. It contains hydrochloric acid, so it has an acidic reaction. In addition to acid, the gastric glands secrete enzymes that participate in the breakdown of proteins - renin and pepsin.

While gastric juice soaks up food, the environment inside the food lump remains alkaline, so the process of splitting carbohydrates continues there for some time with the help of salivary amylase. The muscles in the walls of the stomach slowly
contract and mix
its contents. Then the partially digested food moves in portions into the intestine.

In the small intestine (Fig. 8.6,
p. 34), the process of splitting substances is completed and the absorption of the splitting products takes place. This department receives juice from the pancreas (Fig. 8.3), which contains many digestive enzymes, and bile from the liver (Fig. 8.4). Also, many substances (enzymes, mucus, etc.) are secreted by glands in the walls of the intestine itself. The enzymes amylase, maltase, lactase, and sucrase break down carbohydrates, and trypsin and chymotrypsin break down proteins. Bile, which is produced by the liver and contains bile salts, is needed for the emulsification of fats - the process of breaking them into very small droplets. Emulsified fats are broken down by the


enzyme lipase, and the products of the breakdown are absorbed by the intestinal villi into the lymphatic capillary. Many enzyme molecules are attached to the surface of the cells of the small intestine, which prevents them from


moving
with


food
and


quickly


being


excreted from the


body . In order for as many enzymes as possible to


be involved in


the work of the intestine, the surface area of its walls increases due to the large number of villi (


Fig. 8.5)


. In addition, the presence of villi significantly accelerates the absorption of digestive products by the intestinal walls. Absorption is a complex process. Inside the intestinal villi are blood and lymphatic capillaries, which are separated from the intestinal cavity by only two layers of cells. These cells
work actively and pass digestive products only in one
direction - to the capillary. The products of protein breakdown (amino acids) and carbohydrates (glucose) are absorbed by the intestinal villi. Thus, digestion of small food particles occurs near the intestinal wall, which enter the space between the villi, while larger particles are digested in the intestinal cavity. The movement of the contents of the small intestine is provided by its muscles. There are two layers of muscles in this section - longitudinal and circular. Their contraction moves the food lump from the beginning to the end of the small intestine. In addition, the movements of these muscles ensure mixing of the intestinal contents, which contributes to the digestion process and absorption of digestive products.


Digestive processes in the large intestine In the large intestine (Fig. 8.6), substances that were not absorbed in the small intestine accumulate. In this part of the digestive system, their processing is completed, and then those substances that the body can still use are absorbed . First of all, this is the water contained in food and that formed as a result of digestion reactions. Symbiotic microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, play a significant role in the work of the large intestine. They form the intestinal


microflora


. They break down a number of substances that are not subject to the action of enzymes of the digestive system. In addition, the intestinal microflora produces a number of compounds that we need. Thus, microorganisms are the main suppliers of vitamin B 12 . In addition, they prevent the development of pathogenic bacteria and other harmful organisms.


The longest part of the digestive system is the small intestine. In an adult, its length can reach 4.5–5 m. The large intestine is only 1.5–2 m long.


At the border of the small and large intestines is a small blind appendage
- the appendix. In our ancestors, it took an active part in the digestive processes. And in modern humans, its function has changed: now it participates in the work of the immune system. Inflammation of this appendix is known as "appendicitis".


The mass of microorganisms in the human intestine can be from 1 to 3 kg.


The digestive system has several sections. In each of them, various processes occur that allow the body to effectively digest and provide it with necessary substances. The basis of all digestive processes are reactions involving enzymes. Symbiotic microorganisms that live in the human intestine play a significant role in the work of the digestive system.

Regulation of digestion. The effect of alcohol and smoking on the digestive system

Before moving on to study the regulation of the work of the human digestive system, recall the main sections of this system. What transformations occur with food in different parts of the digestive tract? Where does the absorption of digestive products occur?


Salivary
glands


Fig. 9.1. Human salivary glands


Regulation of digestion The work of the digestive system is regulated by both the nervous and humoral systems of the human body. The nervous system regulates by sending nerve impulses to the corresponding organs. For example, saliva production begins after food enters the oral cavity. But if a person simply sees food, his brain sends a signal to secrete saliva in advance. This allows the body to prepare for food consumption and quickly process it with salivary enzymes (Fig. 9.1). Humoral regulation occurs due to special biologically active substances that accelerate or slow down the work of the digestive system organs. In addition, the organs of the digestive system themselves interact with each other. Thus, the inlet sphincter at the border between the stomach and the esophagus opens the passage for food to the stomach only after it is reached by contractions of the muscles of the esophagus.

The effect of alcohol on the digestive system You certainly know that alcohol consumption has a negative effect on the human body.
And the digestive organs are the first to be affected
. First of all, alcohol, once in the stomach, destroys its mucous membrane and reduces the activity of gastric juice. Under the influence of alcohol, the functioning of the pancreas deteriorates. And


Fig. 9.2. Healthy liver (a) and alcoholic liver (b)


36. Digestion regulation.


The liver suffers the most from the effects of alcohol and tobacco smoking on the digestive system (Fig. 9.2). It must neutralize all harmful substances that enter the body with alcohol and neutralize the products of its processing by the body. As a result, liver cells begin to die. They are replaced by fatty tissue; the liver is destroyed. The worst consequence can be cirrhosis of the liver and its complete death.


Effects of tobacco smoking on the digestive system Tobacco smoking becomes a bad habit because a person gets used to nicotine, which is contained in tobacco. Nicotine primarily affects the cells of the nervous system, but the digestive organs also suffer. Smoking can disrupt their normal blood supply, increasing the risk of stomach cancer. Tobacco smoke negatively affects teeth, causing them to darken and cracks in the enamel, which can cause caries. The greatest danger to the digestive system is posed by impurities contained in tobacco. Among them are many carcinogenic substances that can cause the development of cancerous tumors in the organs of the oral cavity, esophagus and stomach.


Smokers are 30 times more likely to suffer from angina pectoris, 12 times more likely to suffer from
myocardial infarction, and 10 times more likely to suffer from stomach ulcers than non-smokers.


Excessive alcohol consumption can cause gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach lining.


The digestive system is regulated by the nervous and humoral systems, as well as by the interaction of the digestive organs with each other. Excessive alcohol consumption and smoking have an extremely negative effect on the digestive system..TOPIC 2


Diseases of the digestive system


10


Before proceeding to the study of diseases of the human digestive system, remember which organs are part of it. What microorganisms live in the human digestive system? What parasitic organisms can enter the human body through the digestive system?


The digestive system is one of the ways in which pathogens, toxins (poisonous substances produced by living cells or organisms) and dangerous substances enter the human body. Therefore, it is very important to follow the rules for preventing gastrointestinal diseases. Diseases of the digestive system are described in the table.

Helminthiasis (helminthic diseases)


Occur as a result of the entry of parasitic worms into the body - worms. Depending on the type of helminth (parasite), a lesion of one or another organ develops with the corresponding symptoms. Common symptoms include weight loss, malaise, and irritability.


The name "botulism" comes from the Latin word "botulus" - sausage. This disease was first described as a consequence of eating blood sausages in the 18th century.


Botulinum toxin, which causes botulism, is used in medicine to make cosmetics (for example, Botox).


Dangerous diseases of the digestive system include food poisoning, salmonellosis, dysentery, cholera, botulism, and helminthiasis. To prevent them, it is important
