Transport of substances


Internal environment of the body. Blood and lymph

Before proceeding to the study of the internal
environment of the human body, recall the main features by which living organisms differ from non-living objects. Why must living organisms maintain the constancy of their internal environment?


Internal environment of the bodyTo ensure normal vital activity of the human body, it is necessary that the conditions inside it are relatively constant. Temperature, salinity, acidity, and other parameters vary within fairly narrow limits. This constancy is ensured by the presence of the internal environment of the body. The main components of the internal environment of the body are three fluids: blood, lymph, and tissue fluid. These fluids constantly change into each other, thereby changing their chemical composition. They ensure the course of all important processes in the body, because thanks to them, nutrients continuously enter the cells, and metabolic products are removed from them. The relative constancy of the composition and physicochemical properties of the internal environment is called homeostasis. Maintaining homeostasis allows a person to live both in the tropics and in polar regions.


Blood and its functions Blood is an opaque red liquid that circulates through the vessels of the circulatory system. In the human body, it performs transport, regulatory and protective functions. The body of an adult contains an average of 4 to 6 liters of blood. The value of blood is considered in the table.

Characteristics of the function


Transport ¬
Transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as nutrients and metabolic products. In addition, blood transfers heat from the inside of the body to its outer covers. For example, when your cheeks are freezing in the cold, you start rubbing them, and the blood flow increases to the place of rubbing, and warm blood from inside the body warms the tissues


Regulatory ¬
Delivery of hormones and other biologically active substances to the place of their action


Protective Destruction of foreign objects that have penetrated the body by phagocytosis or production of antibodies (for more details, see § 53)


Blood composition Blood is a liquid tissue containing two main components - blood plasma and formed elements. The amount of water in the blood is 90%. The liquid part of the blood is plasma. It consists of water and mineral and organic compounds dissolved in it. The concentration of salts in the blood plasma (Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , HCO 3– , etc.) is 0.9% and is maintained at a constant level to ensure the normal course of physiological processes. Therefore, an aqueous solution with a salt concentration of 0.9% is called physiological. Such a solution can be used to replenish blood in case of significant blood loss. The composition of organic substances in blood plasma includes proteins (albumins, globulins, fibrinogen), fats and carbohydrates. Their concentration level
can vary significantly.
Depending on the level of oxygen saturation, blood is venous and arterial. Arterial blood contains a lot of oxygen and little carbon dioxide. It has a bright red color. Venous blood, on the contrary, contains little oxygen and a lot of carbon dioxide and has a darker color. The color of blood is determined by the content of hemoglobin compounds with oxygen in it: the more such compounds, the brighter the color of the blood.


Tissue fluid In tissues, blood passes through the smallest blood vessels - capillaries. The walls of capillaries are very thin, because they consist of only one layer of cells. These walls do not allow erythrocytes and platelets to pass through them, but blood plasma seeps into the surrounding tissues.

Spleen


Lymph


Lymph nodes


Lymph vessels


Fig. 15.1. Scheme of the structure of the lymphatic system


That part of the blood plasma that has entered the tissues forms tissue (intercellular) fluid. This fluid washes all the cells of the body and carries out the exchange of substances between them and the blood. In its composition, tissue fluid is similar to blood at the time of formation. However, it lacks blood cells and most of its proteins. However, in the case of some negative processes (for example, inflammation), leukocytes from the blood can leave the tissues and enter the tissue fluid. Due to the fact that tissue fluid carries out the exchange of substances between vessels and tissue cells, its composition is constantly changing. Some substances pass into the tissue cells, and others, on the contrary, are secreted by the cells into the tissue fluid. In different tissues, cells may require different substances and secrete different metabolic products. This also affects the composition of tissue fluid, as a result of which it becomes even more diverse.


Vessels Node


Fig. 15.2. Lymph node


Lymph In the tissues of our body, in addition to blood vessels, there are other capillaries - lymphatic (Fig. 15.1). They look like thin tubes closed at one end. The pressure inside the lymphatic capillaries is lower than in the blood vessels, so excess tissue fluid, which is formed in the tissues due to the constant influx
of plasma from the blood capillaries
, seeps into them. Tissue fluid that has seeped into the lymphatic capillaries turns into lymph. Lymph is a transparent fluid that is very similar in composition to tissue fluid, but it contains a large number of lymphocytes. Hence, one of its main functions is to neutralize dangerous microorganisms and substances that have entered the body. With their unclosed end, lymphatic capillaries flow into larger lymphatic vessels. Moving along the lymphatic vessels, lymph enters the lymph nodes, where many lymphocytes are concentrated (Fig. 15.2). Merging, lymphatic vessels flow into a vein, where lymph replenishes blood plasma.


60. The internal environment of the body. Blood and lymph


Lymph nodes are an important barrier to infections and harmful substances that can form in the body. For example, in the event of an injury, body cells can die. The consequence of their death is the formation of harmful cell decay products. And foreign microorganisms enter the body through a wound. These substances and microorganisms reach the lymph nodes with the flow of lymph, where they are neutralized by lymphocytes. If there are a lot of harmful substances or microorganisms, the number of lymphocytes in the nodes increases, and the size of the nodes themselves increases. Therefore, if a person has enlarged lymph nodes in some part of the body, this is an alarming sign. In this case, you should consult a doctor.


If the process of draining tissue fluid from the tissues is disrupted or the lymphatic vessels are blocked by something, this can lead to serious consequences. For example, in the case of elephantiasis (this disease is common in Africa), parasitic roundworms block the movement of lymph. As a result, the limbs of a person swell very much.


The ancient Greek scientists Hippocrates and Aristotle believed that the arterial and venous systems of a person are separate systems and are not connected to each other. However, the ancient Roman physician Claudius Galen proved that blood moves through arteries and veins due to the work of the heart. In the 17th century, William Harvey established that blood moves through arteries from the heart, and through veins to the heart.


The main components of the internal environment of the body are blood, lymph, and tissue fluid. These fluids constantly change from one to another. Blood performs transport, regulatory, and protective functions. It consists of liquid blood plasma and formed elements. . TOPIC 4


Blood Groups. Blood Transfusion

Before moving on to the study of human blood groups, remember what blood is. How does blood differ from lymph and tissue fluid? What functions does blood perform in the human body? Does blood differ in different animals?


Formed elements of bloodFormed elements of blood include erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets (Fig. 16.1). Erythrocytes are red blood cells. Mature erythrocytes do not have a nucleus and contain a lot of hemoglobin protein. Their main function is to transport oxygen. In addition, erythrocytes are able to transport carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). However, a significant part of it is transported by blood plasma in the form of a solution and a compound with water.
Leukocytes are white blood cells. They are quite diverse in
structure and are divided into several types. Leukocytes protect the body from infections and toxins. Platelets, unlike erythrocytes and leukocytes, are not cells, but blood platelets. They are fragments of cells formed as a result of the disintegration of large precursor cells. Platelets play an important role in the process of blood clotting. The formed elements of blood are discussed in more detail in the table.

Blood clottingBlood clotting is the process of formation of fibrin protein threads in the blood, which form a blood clot - a thrombus. This is a rather complex process, which is a series of sequential reactions. When the blood vessel wall is damaged, platelets are destroyed, from which the platelet protein is released. This protein is an enzyme, that is, a catalyst for biochemical reactions. It interacts with one of the plasma proteins - prothrombin, converting it into thrombin. The latter, in turn, interacts with another plasma protein - fibrinogen and converts it into fibrin,
which has the appearance of long threads. These threads become entangled with each other
and form a clot - a thrombus, which covers the damaged area and prevents blood from leaking out of the body.


Blood groups Blood groups are signs that are associated with the biochemical properties of blood and are determined by heredity. The division into groups is based on the presence of antigens in the blood - specific substances that cause a reaction of the immune system and allow people to distinguish blood by certain signs. Most


63. Topic 4


a


antigens are proteins. They can be contained in erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets or blood plasma. Antigens are combined into independent groups - blood group systems. About 30 blood group systems are known in humans. Two blood group systems are of greatest practical importance for humans - AB0 and the Rhesus system.


b


Fig. 16.2. Interaction reaction during blood transfusion of different groups (a) and one group (b)


Blood groups of the AB0 system
Human blood groups (AB0 system) were discovered by the Austrian scientist K. Landsteiner in 1900. The differentiation of human blood according to the AB0 system into four groups is based on the combination of two antigens (agglutinogens A and B) in erythrocytes and two antibodies (agglutinins α and β) in blood plasma. Which blood group has which antigens and antibodies is shown in the table.


Blood groups of the AB0 system


Blood group 0(I)A(II)B(III)AB(IV)


AgglutinogensAbsentOnly ATOnly BA and B


Agglutininsα and βOnly βOnly αAbsent


Why is this division into groups necessary? If the blood group is selected incorrectly during transfusion, there is a threat to
the health of the recipient (the person to whom the blood is being transfused). The fact is that
after the interaction of the same agglutinogens and agglutinins, an agglutination (sedimentation) reaction of erythrocytes occurs. It activates the process of blood clotting and the formation of blood clots in which erythrocytes get stuck. This leads to blockage of blood vessels and can cause death (Fig. 16.2).


Blood groups of the Rhesus system Research into blood group systems did not stop even after the AB0 system was discovered. This was necessary because in some cases, erythrocyte coagulation was observed even when blood of the same group was transfused to a person. As a result, in 1940, the Rh system was discovered. It was first discovered in rhesus macaques, and only later in humans. That is why this system received this name.


64. Blood groups. blood transfusion


Most people have a special antigen on the surface of their erythrocytes - the Rh factor (Rh). Such people are called Rh-positive, and their blood group is designated as Rh+. Rh-negative people do not have this antigen, their blood group is Rh–. During a transfusion of blood that is incompatible with the Rh factor, or during pregnancy, when the mother is Rh-negative and the child is Rh-positive, a Rh conflict occurs. In this case, antibodies are formed in the mother's blood that destroy the fetal erythrocytes.


Blood transfusionBlood plays an extremely important role in the life of the body. If a person loses a lot of blood, their body may not be able to cope with providing tissues and organs with the necessary substances. Therefore, attempts have long been made to transfuse blood in the event of a large loss. However, earlier doctors did not know about the existence of different blood groups and transfused it at random. It is clear that often the
blood groups of the donor (the one who gave blood) and the patient did not match. This
led to the formation of blood clots due to agglutination of red blood cells and the death of the person. Only after K. Landsteiner discovered the blood groups of the ABO system did it become possible to carry out relatively safe blood transfusions. Today, people are transfused only with blood of their group, since the interaction between blood of different groups of the ABO system gives the strongest immune reaction, that is, causes agglutination of red blood cells. Other blood group systems (for example, the Rhesus system) cause a less strong reaction, but this does not mean that they should not be taken into account!


The formed elements of blood are erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets. Blood groups are important characteristics of blood, which are associated with its biochemical properties. The most important for humans are the AB0 and Rhesus blood group systems. Only blood of their group should be transfused to a person. TOPIC 4


Circulatory system. Heart


17


Before moving on to the study of the human circulatory system, remember what structure the circulatory system of different animals has. How can the features of the vital activity of animals affect the structure of their circulatory system?


Heart The heart is a muscular organ of the circulatory system that ensures the movement of blood in the human body. The mass of the heart of an adult is on average 250–350 g. It is located in the middle part of
the chest in a special pericardial sac - the pericardium.
The pericardium is a thin, dense sac that separates the heart from other organs and also prevents it from being displaced and stretched too much. The heart wall consists of three layers: the epicardium (outer), the myocardium (middle), and the endocardium (inner). The thickest of them is the myocardium, which is the heart muscle that provides the contraction of the heart. Inside, the heart is divided into four chambers: two ventricles (right and left) and two atria (right and left) (Fig. 17.1). The right and left halves of the heart do not communicate with each other. The chambers of the right part contain only venous blood, and the chambers of the left - only arterial. In order for the blood between the chambers of the heart to move in only one direction, valves are located in it. Between the left atrium and the left ventricle there is a bicuspid, or mitral, valve

Large circle of blood circulation The human circulatory system is divided into two large parts - the large and small circles of blood circulation (Fig. 17.2). The large circle of blood circulation begins in the left ventricle and ends in the right atrium. Arterial blood is pushed out of the left ventricle, which is carried throughout the body through the vessels. Once in the tissues, it gives off oxygen and is saturated with carbon dioxide, after which it turns into venous blood. Venous blood enters the veins and is transported to the right atrium. From the right atrium, it enters the right ventricle, and from there into the small circle of blood circulation.


Small circle of blood circulationThe small circle of blood circulation begins in the right ventricle and ends in the left atrium. Venous blood is pushed out of the right ventricle, which is transported through the vessels to the lungs. Once in the lungs, it is saturated with oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide, after which it turns into arterial blood. This blood is collected in the veins and transported to the left atrium. From the left atrium, it enters the left ventricle, and from there into the large circle of blood circulation.


The heart is an important organ of the circulatory system, which ensures the movement of blood in the body. The circulatory system in the human body is divided into two large parts - the large and small circles of blood circulation..TOPIC 4


How the heart works


18


Before moving on to studying the functioning of the human heart, remember what chambers it is divided into. How does the human heart differ from the heart of a fish? What layers are distinguished in the heart wall and what functions do they perform?


Cardiac muscle Cardiac muscle works continuously throughout a person's life. That is why it has certain structural features and specific properties, which allowed it to be distinguished as a separate type of muscle tissue. Find out what these properties are from the table.


Main properties of the heart muscle


PropertyCharacteristic


ExcitabilityThe ability to move from a resting state to a working state under the influence of various stimuli


ConductivityThe ability to spread throughout the heart an excitation that has arisen in some part of it


ContractilityThe
ability of the heart muscle tissue to contract under the influence of excitation


AutomaticityThe ability of the heart to contract under the influence of impulses that arise in the heart itself


The heart has its own blood supply system. Through the coronary arteries, blood enters the heart muscle during heart relaxation, and during its contraction, blood from these capillaries is squeezed into the coronary veins.


cardiac cycleThe heart can work continuously for many years due to the fact that its work is organized in the form of a cycle. Due to the correct distribution of the phases of contraction and relaxation of individual parts of the heart, the body manages to provide enough time for the heart muscle to recover during its work. The cardiac cycle is called


68. How the heart works


Atrial systoleDiastoleVentricular systole


Fig. 18.1. The phases of the cardiac cycle


are the set of processes that occur from one heart contraction to the next (Fig. 18.1).
What happens during one cardiac cycle can be traced in
the table.


Phases of the cardiac cycle


Phase of the cardiac cycle Duration of the phase, s What happens


Contraction of the muscles (systole) of the atria


0.1 Blood from the atria is pushed through the valves to the ventricles Contraction of the muscles (systole) of the ventricles 0.3 Venous blood from the right ventricle is pushed into the pulmonary artery, and arterial blood from the left ventricle is pushed into the aorta


Relaxation of the heart muscles (diastole) 0.4 The heart muscle is relaxed, blood from the veins flows into the atria


The indicators by which you can compare the work of the heart in different people or in different situations are systolic and
minute blood volumes. Systolic volume is the amount of blood
ejected by the heart during one contraction. And minute volume is the volume of blood pumped through the heart during one minute.


Features of the heart The existing system of the heart allows it to work for many years in a row. The heart is the main engine of blood flow through the vessels. It cannot stop, as this will cause the cessation of metabolism and lead to the death of a person. In addition, the heart does not have a backup organ that can take over its work for at least


69. Topic 4


some time. Therefore, the work of the heart is organized so that it rests as much as possible. If you look at the time taken by individual phases of the cardiac cycle, you can see that out of 0.8 seconds of the entire cycle, the atria rest for 0.7 seconds, and the ventricles for 0.5 seconds. This gives their muscles the opportunity to recover normally after contraction.


Regulation of heart function Regulation of heart function is carried out in two ways - with the help of nervous or humoral regulation. Nervous regulation is carried out by the arrival of nerve impulses from the cardiovascular centers of the medulla oblongata. One of the nerves receives impulses that accelerate the heart, and the other - impulses that slow down the heart. Humoral regulation is carried out with the help of biologically active substances - hormones secreted by the endocrine glands of the body, and other organic and inorganic substances. For example, the hormone adrenaline accelerates heart contractions. Cardiac activity is also enhanced by an increased concentration of Calcium ions in the blood. Acetylcholine and Potassium ions slow down the heart.
The main glands that regulate the heart are the adrenal glands.
They produce adrenaline and acetylcholine. A feature of heart regulation is that external signals (both nervous and humoral) only change the heart rate, but do not cause them. The signals for the occurrence of contractions are generated by the cells of the heart itself.


Automaticity of heart function The heart must work in any conditions. Therefore, there are mechanisms in it that ensure its work even in the absence of corresponding nerve impulses. That is, the heart can work automatically, without signals from the nervous system. For this, there are several groups of cells in the myocardium that automatically produce rhythmic impulses. These impulses spread to other cells of the heart muscle and cause them to contract. The frequency of these contractions is lower than those that occur under the influence of nervous or humoral signals, but they allow you to maintain the body's vital activity in a critical situation.


The human heart before birth In an adult, the structure of the heart is somewhat different from the structure of the heart of a fetus that develops in the mother's body. Until the moment of


birth,


the child's lungs do not work, so there is no need to drive all the blood flow through their vessels. In this regard, between the right ventricle of the heart and the aorta there is a special vessel - the Botal duct, through which blood passes directly from the right ventricle into the large circle of blood circulation. After the birth of the child, this duct overgrows. If for some reason it does not overgrow, then the child will have serious heart disorders. Such an anomaly is called a congenital heart defect. However, modern doctors
have learned to correct such a disorder through heart surgery.


The muscles of the atria and ventricles are not one structure. They are separated by a septum made of dense tissue. This septum does not allow excitation from the atrial muscles to the ventricular muscles, due to which they can contract independently. The coordination of contractions of the atria and ventricles occurs with the help of a special bundle of fibers that connects their centers for producing rhythmic impulses with each other.


The achievements of modern medicine make it possible to perform a heart transplant in cases when a person's heart is affected by a disease that cannot be cured. The first successful heart transplant was performed by a doctor from South Africa, Christian Bernard, in 1967. Currently, the average life expectancy of a person after a heart transplant is 10 years. The record life expectancy of a person with a transplanted heart has reached 30 years.


Long-term and effective work of the heart is possible due to the existence of a clear cardiac cycle and its rational regulation. The properties of the heart muscle, in particular its ability to be automatic, are of great importance for increasing the reliability of the heart's work..Topic 4


Blood vessels. First aid in case of bleeding


19


Before moving on to the study of human blood vessels, remember what blood is. What functions does blood perform in the human body? What ensures the movement of blood through the vessels? What is the structure of the heart? How does the heart work?


Blood vessels There are three types of blood vessels in the human body - arteries, veins and capillaries. They perform different functions, which determines the differences in their structure (Fig. 19.1). Arteries conduct blood from the heart to the capillaries and must withstand the high pressure that occurs during heart contractions, so they have thick walls, inside which there is a layer of smooth muscle. Capillaries are responsible for the exchange between blood and tissues, so their walls are thin. And veins collect blood from all over the body to transport it to the heart. It is very important for them to ensure that blood moves in only one direction, which is possible due to the presence of special valves. The main characteristics of human blood vessels are described in the table.

Fig. 19.2. Tonometer


Blood pressure and pulse When the heart contracts, it pushes blood into the arteries with great force. Therefore, the blood in them is under pressure, and this pressure is called arterial. Blood pressure is highest during systole, and lowest during diastole. The value of blood pressure is an indicator of the condition of the heart in particular and the circulatory system in general, so doctors often measure it when examining patients. The device for measuring blood pressure is called a tonometer (Fig. 19.2). During contraction, the heart not only pushes blood into the vessels, but also causes periodic oscillations of the walls of the arteries, which are synchronous with the contractions of the heart. You feel these oscillations as a pulse. The nature of the pulse depends on the activity
of the heart and the condition of the arteries. Therefore, measuring its
frequency is very important for diagnosing the condition of the body. When measuring blood pressure, its indicators on different arms may be different. Normally, the difference should not exceed 10 mm Hg. The difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure is called pulse pressure. If the pulse pressure is less than 20 mm Hg., the heart will not receive enough blood for its work. The harder it is for blood to pass through the vessels, the higher the arterial pressure. Therefore, an increase in blood pressure (hypertension) is an indicator of disorders of the cardiovascular system. However, health problems in a person can also occur in the case of too low pressure. If a person's pressure is constantly higher than 140 over 90 or lower than 90 over 60, this is a reason to consult a doctor.


Some features of the blood supply to the human body As you already know, veins are vessels that carry blood from organs. But in the human body there is a vein that, on the contrary, brings blood to the organ. This is the portal vein of the liver. It collects blood from the stomach and intestines and carries it to the liver. There, the portal vein breaks up into smaller veins, and the blood flowing through them comes into contact with the liver cells.


73. Topic 4


a


b


Fig. 19.3. First aid
in case of arterial ( a ) and
venous ( b ) bleeding


These cells neutralize dangerous substances that enter the human body with food. But blood is also brought to the liver by the usual artery. This artery, like the portal vein, breaks up into smaller vessels that directly merge with the veins. Thus, the liver cells receive not pure arterial, but mixed blood. Another unusual structure formed by blood vessels is anastomoses. Anastomoses are connections between arteries and veins that connect them directly, without forming a capillary network. There are a lot of anastomoses in the skin. This allows the body to effectively regulate heat loss. If there is too much heat in the body, the blood flows from the arteries to the veins through the capillaries and gives off excess heat to the air. And if there is not enough heat, the blood goes through the anastomoses to the veins, bypassing the skin capillaries and, accordingly, avoiding the associated heat loss.


First aid for different types of bleeding Depending on the type of damaged vessels, there are three main types of bleeding - arterial, venous and capillary. With arterial bleeding, the blood is bright red and flows quickly, often pulsating. In the case of arterial bleeding, a tourniquet should be applied above the site of hemorrhage - this will allow you to stop the flow of blood. However, it should be remembered that the tourniquet cannot be applied to a naked body, so some kind of cloth should be placed under it. In addition, it is imperative to attach a note indicating the exact time when the tourniquet was applied. This is very important, because the tourniquet must be loosened once an hour so as not to leave the body tissues without blood supply. With venous bleeding, the blood is dark in color, flows
freely, but in a fairly wide stream. In the case of venous bleeding,
the tourniquet is applied below the site of hemorrhage, because it is from there that the blood moves through the veins. However, in many cases, in the case of venous hemorrhage, a simple compression bandage on the wound can be used (Fig. 19.3). Capillary bleeding is not as intense as arterial or venous bleeding, and often stops on its own. In the case of capillary bleeding, an ordinary sterile bandage can be used.


74. Blood vessels. First aid in case of bleeding


In case of bleeding due to injury to the extremities of the head, do not forget that during arterial bleeding, the tourniquet is applied above the bleeding site, and in the case of venous bleeding - below. This is due to the fact that blood moves down the limbs through the arteries, and after applying the tourniquet above the injury site, blood will not flow to it. With veins, the situation is the opposite: blood collects in the veins in the extremities and moves up towards the heart, so the tourniquet below the injury site on the vein stops the outflow of blood from it.


Capillaries got their name from the Latin word capillaris - hairy. Although most capillaries have a smaller diameter than a human hair. The average length of a capillary is 0.7–0.8 mm.


The section of medicine that studies the structure and functioning of veins is called phlebology.


The outstanding Roman physician Galen identified 27 types of pulse, and for each of these types he distinguished three separate varieties. Thanks to such a detailed study of the pulse, doctors in ancient times could make fairly accurate diagnoses without conducting laboratory tests.


There are three types of blood vessels in the human body - arteries, veins and capillaries. Arteries carry blood from the heart, veins - to the heart, and capillaries ensure the exchange of substances between the blood and tissues. First aid in case of bleeding should be provided taking into account which type of vessel was damaged..TOPIC 4


Diseases of the cardiovascular system


20


Before proceeding to the study of diseases of the human cardiovascular system, remember which organs are part of it. What functions does it perform? What parasitic organisms can penetrate the human body through the circulatory system?


Diseases of the cardiovascular system Disorders in the functioning of the cardiovascular system are one of the most common diseases in the modern world. They can lead to serious consequences. And here the time that elapses from the onset of a critical situation (for example, a heart attack or stroke) to the provision of medical care is important. The earlier the care is provided, the greater the chances of a positive result of the doctors' work. Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases may include: failure to follow the rules of a healthy lifestyle (smoking, alcohol abuse, insufficient physical activity), excess body weight, high blood pressure, constant stress, etc. The signs and causes of these disorders are described in the tables.


The most common heart diseases


DiseasesSymptomsCauses of occurrence


Myocardial infarction (Fig. 20.2, p. 78)


Prolonged chest pain, changes in the cardiogram (a graphic representation of electrical fields that arise during the work of the heart)


Violation of the blood supply to a section of the heart muscle, which led to its necrosis (death). Most often occurs due to blockage by a thrombus of one of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (they are called coronary)


Ischemic heart disease


Disturbance of blood flow in the coronary arteries, often due to the development of
atherosclerosis


Insufficient blood supply to the myocardium of the heart, heart rhythm disturbances, shortness of breath, chest pain


Arrhythmias Disturbance of the rhythm, sequence and strength of heart muscle contractions

Strokes are divided into ischemic and hemorrhagic by the nature of their occurrence. Ischemic stroke occurs in the event of impaired blood circulation in the brain. As a result of blockage of the vessels, blood cells do not receive the necessary amount of oxygen and die. Because of the similarity of the events during an ischemic stroke to those in the event of a myocardial infarction, this type of stroke is sometimes called a “brain infarction.” In the case of a hemorrhagic stroke, the situation is different. There is not a shortage, but an excess of blood. This type of stroke begins with the rupture of blood vessels in the brain. But, as in the first case, impaired blood circulation leads to the death of brain cells. Since the causes of these two types of strokes are different, their treatment is different. However, the treatment
of any form of stroke is long and requires
a lot of effort.

Fig. 20.3. Thrombophlebitis Prevention of cardiovascular diseases To prevent the development of cardiovascular diseases, it is advisable to adhere to the following preventive measures: Active lifestyle: lack of movement causes problems with the heart and blood vessels. Rational nutrition. Excess body weight has a particularly negative effect on the condition of the heart and blood vessels. Giving up bad habits: smoking and alcohol cause irreparable harm to the heart. Timely periodic rest and psychological relief: excessive stress disrupts the work of the heart. Monitoring your blood pressure and preventive examinations at the doctor. Why is an active lifestyle so important for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases? There are several reasons. Yes, during regular physical activity, the heart muscle is trained, as a result of which it works more efficiently. In addition, thanks to regular physical activity, other muscles of the body are strengthened and work better. And they, in turn, during contraction, contribute to the movement of blood through the veins to the heart. Thus, the work of the heart is facilitated. And it is very necessary to facilitate it,
since the heart is an unpaired organ and must work continuously and reliably
throughout a person's life. Due to insufficient physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle, the movement of blood in the veins slows down. Its reverse movement is impossible due to the valves in these vessels. Too slow forward movement causes blood to accumulate and varicose veins to develop.


78. Diseases of the cardiovascular system


The first mention of a stroke is considered to be the descriptions of Hippocrates made in the 460s BC. He described loss of consciousness as a result of brain disease.


Thrombophlebitis of the upper and lower extremities and thrombophlebitis of the vessels of internal organs are distinguished by their location. Thrombophlebitis most often affects the veins of the lower extremities.


Coronary heart disease is one of the main causes of death from heart disease in Ukraine. Smoking significantly increases the risk of coronary heart disease. Even passive smoking can cause this disease, when a person does not smoke himself, but is often among smokers and simply inhales tobacco smoke.


A mummy with signs of varicose veins of the lower extremities was found in Egypt. The age of this mummy is over 2500 years.


Diseases of the cardiovascular system are one of the most common. Among them are heart attack, stroke, hypertension, etc., which can lead to serious consequences. In the event of such diseases,
a person should be provided with medical assistance as soon as possible. To prevent them,
it is necessary to follow preventive measures and lead a healthy lifestyle.. Generalization on the topic "Transport of substances"

Excretory system


21


Before moving on to the study of the human excretory system, remember what structure the excretory system of different animals has. How can the features of the life of animals affect the structure of their excretory system?


Skin


Lungs


Structure and functions of the excretory system
The excretory system is extremely important for the
human body. Metabolic products must be excreted quickly, otherwise they can lead to poisoning of the body. The main organ of human excretion is the kidneys. The main, but not the only one. The lungs, skin and liver also perform the excretory function (Fig. 21.1). The kidneys are part of the urinary system, which also includes the ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra (Fig. 21.2). The main task of the urinary system is to remove water-soluble metabolic products from the body.


LiverLiver


Kidneys


Kidneys Kidneys are paired bean-shaped organs (Fig. 21.3). The average weight of a kidney in an adult is 120 g. These organs consist of two layers: the outer cortical and the inner medulla. Arteries, veins, lymphatic vessels, nerves, and the urethra enter the kidney from its inner


side


,


and


the


place of their entry is called the renal hilum. The cavity inside the kidney is called the renal pelvis. The main functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. Nephrons are responsible for the formation of urine.


Urinary bladder


Ureteral canal


UretersUreters are tubes 30–35 cm long that connect the kidneys with the urinary bladder. Through them, urine from the renal pelvis enters the urinary bladder.


Fig. 21.2. Structure of the urinary system Urinary bladder From the nephrons, urine


enters the renal pelvis
through collecting tubules, and from there through the ureter to
the urinary bladder. The urinary bladder is a muscular sac that consists of unstriated (smooth) muscles and is covered with epithelium on the inside. Urine is collected in it. To prevent it from flowing out involuntarily, this organ has two sphincters (muscle-locks). From the urinary bladder, urine is excreted from the body through the urethra.


The medulla of


the urethra is a tube that carries urine that has accumulated in the urinary bladder out of the body. In men, the urethra is much longer than in women. While in women its length is only 3–4 cm, in men it reaches 18 cm.


The cortical layer


of the renal pelvis


Nephron The nephron (Fig. 21.4, p. 84) consists of a capsule, two convoluted tubules and a long loop between them. Inside the capsule is a vascular glomerulus formed by capillaries. The capsule extends from the Fig. 21.3. Structure of the kidney

a convoluted tubule that forms a long loop that passes into the next convoluted tubule. It falls into the collecting duct, through which the urine formed in the nephron is transported further.


The collecting duct


Fig. 21.4. Schematic diagram of the nephron


Skin Water, urea and some salts are excreted from the body through the ducts of the sweat glands. Due to the large surface area of the skin, various toxins and
metabolic products can be excreted very quickly through it. Evaporation
of water excreted through the sweat glands causes heat loss, which is also very important, since heat is one of the metabolic products and its excess in the body is undesirable. Heat can be excreted through the skin not only during the evaporation of sweat. The skin usually has a temperature higher than the ambient temperature and emits heat throughout its surface. The greater the difference in temperature between the skin and the environment, the faster heat is excreted from the human body.


LiverThe liver produces bile pigments from hemoglobin of destroyed erythrocytes, which are excreted in bile into the intestine, from where they are removed with feces. In addition, one of the most important functions of the liver is the processing of metabolic products of proteins and nucleic acids, as a result of which nitrogenous products are formed, which are excreted by the kidneys.


LungsThe lungs remove gaseous metabolic products from the body. First of all, this is carbon dioxide, which is a product of the oxidation of


84. The excretory system


of organic substances in the process of energy production. Water is also removed from the body through the moisture on the surface of the pulmonary alveoli.


The role of the kidneys in the implementation of water-salt metabolism
For normal metabolism, the concentration of salts in the human body must be relatively constant. As a result, it can fluctuate within quite narrow limits due to the presence of kidneys in humans, which are an extremely important regulator of the body's water-salt balance. If there is too much water in the body and the concentration of salts decreases, the kidneys reduce the absorption of water from the primary urine, which is formed in the nephron capsule, and accelerate its excretion from the body. If, on the contrary, there is little water, then the intensity of its absorption from the primary urine increases.


Healthy kidneys filter about 1200 ml of blood per minute.


Of all the organs, kidneys are transplanted most often. Sometimes an additional kidney can form in a person during embryonic development.


There are about 1 million nephrons in the kidney in total.


The excretory system removes metabolic products from the body. Excretory functions in the body are performed by the kidneys, lungs, skin, and liver. The kidneys are part of the urinary system, which removes water-soluble metabolic products from the body. The main functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. In addition to the kidneys, the urinary system includes the ureters, bladder, and urethra..TOPIC 5


How the urinary system works

Before moving on to studying the human excretory system, remember what organs are part of it. What functions do they perform? What is a nephron? What substances are part of blood plasma?


GlucoseAmino acidsOther substances


The process of primary urine formation Blood enters the vascular glomerulus of the nephron capsule through a thin blood vessel - the afferent arteriole, and leaves through another - the efferent one. The diameter of the efferent vessel is smaller than the afferent one, so the blood is under increased pressure in the glomerular capillaries. This facilitates the filtration of blood plasma, saturated with various substances, into the capsule cavity. The liquid formed as a result of this process is called primary urine. Primary urine is similar in composition to blood plasma, but normally it lacks proteins. During the day, approximately 150–180 l of primary urine is formed in the human body.

Urine going to the bladder


Fig. 22.1. Scheme of urine formation


In addition to harmful substances and metabolic products, primary urine also contains useful substances that the body can still use. In addition, it contains too much water, which the body needs. Therefore, in the convoluted tubule, the composition of urine changes significantly, and it is converted into secondary urine, where the concentration of substances that are excreted from the body is much higher. Normally, approximately 1.5 l of secondary urine is formed per day.


86. How the urinary system works


Secondary urine is formed by two processes - reabsorption (reverse absorption) and secretion (excretion). Both of these processes are carried out by the cells of the convoluted tubule epithelium. The substances they have absorbed enter the capillaries that tightly surround the convoluted tubule. Water, glucose and other substances are absorbed from the primary urine, and those compounds that need to be removed from the body are secreted, such as ammonia, antibiotics, etc. Urea is one of the main metabolic products that is excreted from the body through the kidneys. It is a product of the metabolism of proteins and other organic substances that contain nitrogen.


Regulation of kidney function Excretion processes in the kidneys are regulated by both signals from the nervous system and the influence of hormones. Thus, an important role is played by antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is produced by one of the brain departments. Its action leads to a decrease in the amount
of urine produced, but at the same time the concentration
of substances excreted increases. The influence of the hormone adrenaline also reduces urine production, and the hormones tyrosine and cortisone, on the contrary, increase it. Both of them are produced by the adrenal glands. Urination is also regulated by the nervous system. There are nerve endings in the walls of the bladder, which, when it is stretched (when it is filled with urine), send a signal to the central nervous system. The signals are perceived by the center in the lower part of the spinal cord and sent by it to the cerebral cortex. From here, the signal for urination comes to the walls of the bladder and the sphincter muscle, which opens the urethral passage. Therefore, the regulation of kidney function is neurohumoral.


Primary urine is formed in the nephron capsule. In the nephron tubules, substances necessary for the body are absorbed from it and unnecessary ones are additionally excreted. As a result, primary urine turns into secondary urine. Regulation of the kidneys is neurohumoral..TOPIC 5


Diseases of the excretory system


23


Before proceeding to the study of disorders of the human excretory system, remember which organs are part of it. What functions does it perform? What parasitic organisms can penetrate the human body through the excretory system?


Disorders of the excretory organs Both
infectious diseases and the action of non-infectious factors can lead to disorders in the work of the excretory organs. Thus,
inflammatory processes in the urinary system can occur as a result of an allergic reaction or metabolic disorders. Pathogens enter the organs of the urinary system either through the channels of the system itself or through the blood. So, in the case of angina or dental diseases, bacteria from the diseased organ can enter the glomeruli of the nephrons with the bloodstream and cause their inflammation. Then the infection will begin to spread down to other parts of the urinary system - the ureters, bladder, urethra. Such an infection is called descending. If the infection first gets into the urethra, causes its inflammation and spreads upwards - to the bladder, ureters and kidneys, then it is called ascending. The most common diseases of the urinary system are described in the table.

To prevent the development of diseases of the excretory system, certain preventive measures should be followed: A balanced diet prevents metabolic disorders. In addition, it
provides for limiting alcohol consumption, which
disrupts the processes of excretion of metabolic products from the body, increases the risk of kidney stone formation (Fig. 23.1) and the development of malignant tumors. Timely dental treatment prevents infection from entering the blood vessels and their further transportation to the organs of the excretory system. Hardening allows you to maintain the immune system at a high level. Compliance with personal hygiene rules prevents infection from entering the body through the urethra.


Common diseases of the excretory system are pyelonephritis, urethritis, cystitis, and kidney stones. To reduce the risk of developing these diseases, it is necessary to follow appropriate preventive measures..TOPIC 5

Structure and functions of the skin Human skin is the largest organ of its body. The total surface area of the skin is about 2 m 2 . It consists of three main layers: epidermis, dermis (the skin itself), and subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 24.1). The epidermis is formed by a multilayered squamous epithelium. It consists of two layers: the horny layer, which is represented by dead keratinized cells, and the germ layer - living cells that are constantly dividing. The dermis is a layer of connective tissue consisting of elastic fibers. These fibers provide elasticity and stretchability of the skin. The dermis is the main part of the skin. It contains receptors, skin glands, hair roots, blood and lymphatic vessels. Among the human skin glands are: sweat (secrete sweat); sebaceous (secrete substances (secretions) that lubricate hair and skin); mammary (modified sweat glands).
The subcutaneous tissue is
the deepest layer of the skin. Its cells can temporarily accumulate fat, which is a reserve of nutrients and protects the body from hypothermia and mechanical damage (for example, shocks).


Fig. 24.1. Skin structure


90. Body coverings and thermoregulation


Human skin covers form a number of derivatives. The main ones are hair and nails, which protect the body from adverse external influences. Thus, nails cover the fragile and sensitive fingertips, protecting them from mechanical damage. Human hair is concentrated mainly on the head, where it plays an important role as a thermal insulator - it prevents excessive overheating of the head from sunlight. Thus, the skin separates the human body from the external ¬


environment. It protects it from the penetration of harmful organisms, mechanical and chemical damage. Also, as you know, the skin plays an important role in the processes of excretion: water-soluble metabolic products are excreted from the body through its glands. Ultimately, it participates in the body's thermoregulation: excess heat can be excreted through it, and if necessary, the skin helps to preserve heat in the body.


Mechanism of thermoregulation Thermoregulation is the balance of heat production and loss in the body. Thermoregulation is very important for humans, since their body
can only carry out metabolism normally if the body temperature is constant.
During the process of metabolism, heat in the body is generated as a result of biochemical reactions in cells. Heat production processes occur mainly in internal organs and skeletal muscles. Heat transfer within the body is carried out mainly by the circulatory system: heated blood transfers it to other parts. Heat loss processes are provided by the skin, lungs, and excretory organs. The skin plays the main role here. Heat loss is regulated by the amount of blood flowing through the skin capillaries. For example, when the body needs to give off excess heat, the vessels expand, more blood flows through them, the skin heats up, giving off more heat. This process is easy to notice by the redness of the skin. If heat should be saved, the movement of blood through the narrowed vessels of the skin slows down. The skin becomes pale and colder. Heat loss can increase significantly due to sweat, while a significant amount of heat is spent on its evaporation. The regulation of the processes of heat formation and release occurs through the activity of the central nervous system and endocrine glands. It is carried out reflexively.


91. Topic 5


Heat and sunstroke Heat stroke is a pathological condition of the body that occurs as a result of its overheating. The most common causes of heat stroke are high temperature and humidity. Under conditions of high humidity, sweat cannot evaporate from the surface of the skin, so the body does not have time to get rid of excess heat, which leads to a deterioration in its condition. Sunstroke is a type of heat stroke. It occurs when the head overheats under the influence of direct sunlight. In the event of heat or sunstroke, you should immediately consult
a doctor or call an ambulance. Before providing qualified medical
care, it is necessary to move the victim to a cool place or at least to the shade. Then ensure that he breathes freely and try to cool the body with the help of cold compresses, pouring water, and drinking plenty of water. To avoid heat and sunstroke, do not go outside in hot weather without a light-colored hat and avoid heavy physical labor. In conditions of high temperature, wear light, loose clothing and drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration.


Skin diseases You have known since childhood about the importance of clean skin, which is the key to the health of the body. Therefore, you have long known the measures for the prevention of skin diseases: follow the elementary rules of hygiene, eat rationally, temper the body, use cosmetics wisely. The most common skin diseases are described in detail in the table.


Skin diseases

Hardening Hardening is a set of measures aimed at increasing the functional reserves of the body and its resistance to the adverse effects of physical factors of the environment. Hardening allows you to improve the protective capabilities of the immune system and prevents the development of diseases. A person can harden his body thanks to: air baths; sun baths; water procedures. However, keep in mind that the arbitrary use of natural factors and improper hardening can lead to negative
consequences and harm health. It is necessary to harden the body
gradually and carefully. In case of problems or doubts, you should consult a doctor. Hygienic requirements for hardening: regularity of procedures; gradual increase in strength and duration of the procedure; taking into account the individual characteristics of the body; constant monitoring of the body's condition.


The skin is the largest organ of the human body. It protects the body from the negative effects of external factors and the entry of pathogens into it. The skin consists of three layers - the epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue. It includes sweat and sebaceous glands, receptors, nerves, blood vessels, etc. The skin plays an extremely important role in the processes of thermoregulation of the body.
