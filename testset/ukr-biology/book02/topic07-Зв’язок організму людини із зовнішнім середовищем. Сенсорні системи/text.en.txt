Before proceeding to the study of human sensory systems, remember what sense organs animals have. What sense organs are characteristic of mammals? Do the sense organs of mammals differ from those of fish and reptiles?


Human sensory systems Man lives in a world that is constantly changing. And in order to exist normally in this changing environment, he needs to constantly receive information. Who is standing nearby? Which car honked? Which store has the inscription "Products"? Where should I put my foot so as not to slip? What does this ice cream taste like? A person learns about all this thanks to his sense organs, which in scientific language are called sensory systems, or analyzers. Sensory systems (analyzers) are complex structures that perceive all stimuli coming from the external and internal environment of the body and conduct their subtle analysis. They often talk about the five senses of a person, and sometimes they also mention the so-called "sixth" sense. However, in fact, a person has more sensory systems. Among the human sensory systems, the following are distinguished: vision; hearing; balance;


taste; smell; touch;


motion;
temperature; pain.


Structure of sensory systems Studying animal biology, you learned about the sense organs. And sensory systems are a broader concept. In addition to the organs that directly perceive signals (eye, ear, nose


, etc.), they include those parts


of the nervous system


that transmit signals from


the place of perception and those parts of the brain that process these signals


.


Accordingly, in each sensory system, three closely related parts are distinguished: peripheral, middle and central (Fig. 37.1). The peripheral part of sensory systems are the receptors of the sense organs, which convert the energy of the stimulus into the process of nervous excitation
or, in other words, transform the force of the stimulus
into a nerve impulse. Receptors can be external and internal. External receptors perceive signals from the external environment, and internal receptors perceive signals from the internal organs of the body. Different types of receptors perceive different signals. For example, mechanoreceptors perceive mechanical stimuli (for example, pressure), photoreceptors - light, thermoreceptors - temperature, chemoreceptors can distinguish substances by their chemical properties. The middle, or conductive, part of the sensory system consists of sensitive neurons connected in series. They are the path that leads from the receptor to the cerebral cortex. Areas of the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres that perceive information from the corresponding receptor formations constitute the central, or cortical, part (core) of the sensory system. The nuclei of the analyzers do not have clearly defined boundaries. Their role is to realize the perceived sensation. Areas of the cortex where the cortical nuclei are located are called sensory zones of the cerebral cortex.


To perceive information from the external and internal environment, a person has special sensory systems. Each of them consists of three main parts - the peripheral part, which perceives signals using receptors, the middle part, which conducts signals to the brain, and the central part - the cerebral cortex, which processes signals..TOPIC 8


Visual sensory system

Before moving on to the study of the human visual system, remember what organs of vision are present in animals. What are the features of the organs of vision of mammals?
Do the organs of vision differ in mammals and insects?


Visual sensory system The visual sensory system includes the organs of vision (eyes), optic nerves, and a section of the cortex that processes signals from visual receptors. This section (cortical center) of the visual sensory system is located in the occipital lobe of the cortex.

Structure of the eye The eyes are located in the eye sockets (orbits) of the human skull. The eye consists of the eyeball and the auxiliary apparatus. The accessory apparatus of the eye (Fig. 38.1) ensures its normal functioning, and the eyeball is responsible for conducting light, regulating its quantity, focusing the image, and perceiving light signals. The accessory apparatus of the eye includes the eyelids (folds of skin that protect the eyes), eyebrows (hair above the eyes), eyelashes (hair at the edge of the eyelids), lacrimal glands, and eye muscles. These elements of the accessory apparatus
prevent
foreign objects, sweat, and dust from entering the eyes. In addition, the eyelids and eyelashes protect the eyes from too bright light. The eye muscles ensure the movements of the eyeballs. Thanks to them, a person can change the direction of his gaze without turning his head.

The outer, or sclera, membrane of the eye (sclera) protects the eyeball and gives it shape. The front part of the sclera is transparent and transmits light. It is called the cornea. The middle, or vascular, membrane consists of three parts: the anterior (iris), the middle (ciliary body) and the posterior (the vascular membrane itself). The iris is colored by a special substance called melanin. In its center is an opening called the pupil, through which light rays enter the eye. The pupil can dilate or constrict, thus regulating the amount of light entering the eye. The ciliary body is located behind the iris. It supports the lens and, thanks to the contraction of the ciliary muscle, can change its shape. The lens has the appearance of a biconvex lens and is located behind the pupil. Changing the shape of the lens is a way to provide “focusing”, that is, to obtain a clear image precisely on the receptors that perceive it. This process is called accommodation. It allows you to clearly see objects that are located at different distances from a person. The choroid of the eye forms a fluid that fills the anterior
and posterior chambers of the eye. The anterior chamber is located between the cornea and
the iris, the posterior chamber is between the iris and the lens. They provide the cornea and lens with nutrients, since they do not have blood vessels. The inner membrane, the retina, adjoins the choroid from the inside and lines the fundus of the eye. It has several layers: on the outside, a layer of pigment cells, then a layer of photoreceptors, and finally a layer of intercalated neurons formed from nerve cells, the axons of which form the optic nerve. Inside, the eye is filled with the vitreous humor, which occupies most of the eye cavity. It consists of a transparent gelatinous mass that does not contain either blood vessels or nerves. The vitreous humor gives the eye a spherical shape.


135. TOPIC 8


The shape of the lens when viewing objects that are far away


Accommodation of the eye We see an object as a result of its image falling on the retina. In the case of objects at different distances from the eye, their precise focusing on the retina is achieved by changing the curvature of the lens. This ability is called accommodation (Fig. 38.3). When looking from objects far away to objects close to the eye, the ciliary muscle contracts, and the lens, due to its elasticity, becomes more convex. At the same time, its refractive power increases and the image is focused on the retina. When the object is moved away from the eye, the muscle tension decreases.
The ciliary body is stretched, and the lens becomes
flatter. This reduces the refractive power, and objects located at a distance become clearly visible.

perception of light Before light reaches the retina, it passes through the cornea, anterior chamber fluid, pupil, lens, and vitreous body. These structures form the optical apparatus of the eye. The human retina contains photoreceptors — cones and rods (Fig. 38.4). Rods contain the visual pigment rhodopsin. They perceive the entire spectrum of visible light and work well in twilight conditions. However, rods do not distinguish colors. Cones contain the visual pigment iodopsin and provide color vision. However, they
can work only under conditions of sufficiently bright lighting.
Most cones are located in the center of the retina. This place is called the yellow spot and is the zone of the best vision. In addition to the yellow spot, the retina has a blind spot, which looks like a whitish round spot and is devoid of light-sensitive elements, so light rays are not perceived here. When light hits the photoreceptors, complex processes occur in them that cause


136. Visual sensory system


nervous excitation — a signal. It travels along the optic nerve to the subcortical centers of vision, then travels to the cortex of the occipital lobes of the brain, where it is perceived as a visual sensation.


Color perceptionYou already know that cones are receptors of daytime vision that are capable of perceiving different colors. Color vision is provided by three types of cones. Receptors of the first type are excited by red light, the second by green, and the third by blue. The perception of all other colors occurs as a result of the excitation of these cones in different ratios.


The color of the iris is provided by the substance melanin, which is black. And the different color of the eyes is due to the unequal amount and spatial distribution of melanin in the iris. After the age of 40, a person experiences a sharp decrease in accommodation ability: he or she ceases to distinguish objects at a close distance. This phenomenon is called senile farsightedness. Its development is associated with the loss of elasticity of the lens. In addition to humans, only great apes have three types of cones in the retina. In other apes, the retina contains only two types of cones, which perceive only blue and red colors.


The visual sensory system consists of the eyes, optic nerves, and the visual zone in the occipital cortex. The eye is a paired organ located in the eye sockets of the skull and consists of the eyeball and the accessory apparatus of the eye (eyelids, eyebrows, eyelashes, muscles, and lacrimal glands). The eyeball is formed by three membranes, the lens and the vitreous humor. The lens focuses the image on the retina. The retina is the membrane of the eye that perceives light stimuli using photoreceptors..TOPIC 8


Auditory sensory system. Equilibrium system


39


Before moving on to study the human auditory system, remember what organs of hearing animals have. What are the features of the hearing organs of mammals? Do the hearing organs of mammals and insects differ?


Auditory sensory systemHearing is a type of sensitivity that provides the perception of sound vibrations. The auditory sensory system includes the hearing organs, auditory nerves, and a section of the cortex that processes signals from auditory receptors. This section (cortical center) of the auditory sensory system is located in the temporal lobe of the cortex.


Structure of the earThe organ of hearing is partially located in the thickness of the temporal bone of the skull. It consists of three main sections: the outer, middle
, and inner ear (Fig. 39.1). The outer and middle ear
are designed to conduct and amplify sounds, the inner ear contains the sound-receiving apparatus.


Outer earThe outer ear is represented by the auricle and the external auditory canal. The auricle captures and directs sound waves into the auditory canal. In human ancestors, it was quite mobile, but in most modern people this structure is immobile. The external auditory canal is a tube that conducts sounds to the eardrum. Its walls contain sebaceous and modified sweat glands that secrete earwax, which moisturizes the ear canal and protects it from the action of microorganisms.


middle and inner ear The middle ear is located between the external auditory canal and the inner ear. It consists of the tympanic cavity, which is connected to the nasopharynx through the Eustachian (auditory) tube. The volume of the tympanic cavity is about 1 cm 3 . It begins with the eardrum and contains the auditory tube and three auditory ossicles, together

this fluid irritates the receptors located in the spiral (Corti) organ of the cochlea. Auditory receptors have an elongated shape. One end is fixed on the basal membrane, and the opposite end contains hairs of different lengths. These hairs vibrate together with the fluid in the canal and touch the membrane hanging above them. As a result, they generate excitation, which is transmitted along
the fibers of the auditory nerve, which departs from the receptors. The nature of
the excitation depends on the properties of the sound waves. High tones are captured in the narrow part of the cochlea, and low tones are perceived by receptors on the wide part of the basal membrane at the top of the cochlea. From the receptors of the spiral organ, excitation is transmitted along the auditory nerve to the subcortical and cortical (in the temporal lobe) hearing centers, where sound recognition occurs (Fig. 39.3).


Sensory balance system In the human body, the inner ear performs a dual role: perception of sounds (cochlea with the spiral organ) and regulation of the body's position in space, maintaining balance. The latter function is provided by the vestibular apparatus, which consists of two sacs - oval and round, and three semicircular canals, expanded at the base (Fig. 39.4). The canals and sacs are interconnected and filled with fluid. On their inner surface are located sensitive hair cells, from which nerve fibers depart.

Sensitive hair cells are immersed in a gelatinous substance
- the otolith membrane. In the upper
part of this membrane are embedded calcium bicarbonate crystals - otoliths. They press on the membrane, forcing it to bend. At the same time, excitation occurs in the sensitive hairs, which is transmitted to the brain. If the body position has been disturbed, it is restored due to signals from the brain, which are transmitted to the skeletal muscles.


Hearing acuity in different people is different. In some it is reduced or normal, in others it is increased. There are people with absolute hearing - they are able to determine the pitch of a given tone by hearing. Musical hearing allows you to accurately determine the intervals between sounds of different heights, to recognize melodies. People with musical hearing have a sense of rhythm, they are able to accurately repeat a given tone, a musical phrase.


The auditory sensory system consists of the organs of hearing, auditory nerves and the auditory zone in the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. The organ of hearing is divided into three main parts: the outer, middle and inner ear. The outer and middle ear capture, conduct and amplify sound vibrations, and the inner is responsible for their perception. The function of maintaining balance is provided by the vestibular apparatus, which consists of two sacs - oval and round, as well as three semicircular canals..TOPIC 8


Sensory systems of taste and smell


40


Before moving on to study the human taste and smell system, remember what organs of taste and smell animals have. Which animals have the best sense of smell? Are the organs of smell different in mammals and insects?


Olfactory sensory system The olfactory sensory system includes the olfactory receptors of the nasal cavity, the afferent nerves, and the area of the cortex that processes the signals of the olfactory receptors. Olfactory receptors are located inside the nasal cavity, namely in the area of the upper nasal passage and the posterior upper part of the nasal septum (Fig. 40.1). The receptors consist of cells that form the olfactory epithelium.

perception of odors The acuity of smell is characterized by the threshold of sensation, i.e. the minimum amount of odorous substances that can cause a sense
of smell. As for the perception of the same odorous substance,
it varies widely in different people. In addition, the acuity of smell can vary widely in the same person depending on many conditions, for example, humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, etc. Changes in the acuity of smell associated with adaptation are especially pronounced. People who work with substances that have an unpleasant odor quickly get used to it and stop feeling it.


Fig. 40.1. Location of the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity


gustatory sensory system The gustatory sensory system includes taste receptors in the oral cavity, afferent nerves and a section of the cortex that processes signals from taste receptors. A person does not have separate gustatory nerves. With the help of the taste analyzer, the taste of food is recognized after


it


hits the mucous membrane of the oral cavity. The mucous membrane of the oral cavity
contains


special formations - taste buds, which perceive taste stimuli. They have the appearance of a bottle that opens outwards through a small opening - the taste pore.

40.2. Location of taste perception zones on the tongue


perception of taste Stimuli of taste receptors are substances in aqueous solutions. If a substance is insoluble in water, then it has no taste. Distilled water also has no taste. There are four types of taste sensations: sour, salty, bitter and sweet. The fact that we feel different tastes of food is the result of the interaction of many sensations. This is explained by the fact that, in addition to the taste buds, there are other sensitive endings on the surface of the tongue that perceive temperature, tactile and pain stimuli. The surface of the tongue is not equally sensitive to different types of taste stimuli. Sweet taste is better felt at the tip of the tongue and less so at the base. Bitter taste, on the contrary, is maximally felt at the base and minimally at the tip of the tongue. Sour taste is best perceived by the lateral parts of the tongue (Fig. 40.2).


In the case of complete adaptation to one odor, that is, complete loss of the ability to sense it, the acuity of smell for other odors may remain unchanged.


The receptors of the olfactory sensory system are located
in the nasal cavity, and the receptors of the gustatory sensory system are in the oral cavity. Both olfactory and gustatory receptors produce signals for the nervous system when certain molecules hit them. For olfactory receptors, these are molecules of volatile substances that enter the body with air. For taste receptors, these are substances dissolved in water that have entered the oral cavity..TOPIC 8


Sensory systems of movement, touch, temperature, pain


41


Before moving on to the study of the systems of movement, touch, temperature, and pain, remember what importance the sense of touch has for animals. Which animals have the best tactile sensitivity? Why do cats need whiskers?


Tactile sensory system The tactile sensory system plays an exceptional role in human life. It is especially important during interaction with vision and hearing in the process of forming a holistic perception of the world around a person. In case of loss of vision and hearing, a person can “hear”, “read”, that is, act and be useful to society, using a tactile analyzer through training and various technical devices. Human tactile sensitivity is due to the functioning of the skin mechanoreceptors, which perceive mechanical influences in the form of touch or pressure (Fig. 41.1). The tactile system works very simply. Mechanical action on the skin causes irritation of the nerve ending, as a result of which a nerve impulse occurs. This impulse, which carries information about
the stimulus, is transmitted to the cerebral cortex, where
sensations are formed. A distinctive feature of this analyzer is that the receptor area of touch is larger than that of other sense organs. This provides high sensitivity of the skin analyzer.


Tactile receptorThermal receptorCold receptorPain receptorPressure and vibration receptor

144.sensory systems of movement, touch, temperature, pain


temperature sensory systemThe receptors of the temperature sensory system are located mainly in the skin, although they are also found in other places, for example, in the oral cavity. There are two types of temperature receptors - heat and cold. They perceive, respectively, temperatures higher and lower than the temperature of the human body.


Motor sensory systemThe motor sensory system ensures the coordination of human movements. Its receptors are located in muscles and tendons. They signal the degree of tension of muscle fibers, the position of joints and parts of the human body in space. With the help of the motor sensory system, a person can perform complex
movements


in space even in the absence of vision .
Pain sensory systemPain is a specific psychophysiological state of a person that occurs as a result of the action of strong or damaging factors. It is accompanied by a very unpleasant sensation. Pain plays an important protective function in the body. Strong or damaging stimuli are perceived by pain receptors, which are located in almost all organs. From them, nerve impulses are sent to the brain.


In the skin, tactile receptors are distributed unevenly and provide different parts of the body with different sensitivity. There are a lot of them on the hands (especially on the fingertips) and lips of a person. There are


about 10 times more cold points in the human skin than thermal ones.


The sensory systems of movement and touch use mechanoreceptors to perceive stimuli. The sensory temperature system has two main types of receptors - thermal and cold. Strong or damaging stimuli in the human body are perceived by pain receptors, which are located in almost all organs. TOPIC 8


Sensory system disorders


42


Before proceeding to the study of
sensory system disorders, recall the features of their
structure and functioning. What components are included in the visual system? How does the ear perceive sound vibrations? How does a person perceive heat and cold?


General disorders of the sensory systemsAny sensory system can work only if all three of its parts are working. That is, the receptor part that perceives irritation, the conducting nerve or nerves and areas of the cerebral cortex that process the relevant information. If at least one of these structures is damaged, the sensory system will not work.

Fig. 42.1. Image formation in the eye in case of myopia ( a ) and hyperopia ( b )


visual impairmentIn the case when light rays, having passed through the optical media of the eye, focus not on the retina, visual anomalies arise. If the image appears in front of the retina, myopia develops, if behind it - hyperopia (Fig. 42.1). To correct myopia, biconvex lenses of glasses are used, and for hyperopia - biconvex lenses. There are diseases that result in a person not being able to distinguish certain colors: color blindness and color blindness. They are associated with impaired function of a certain type of cones. To maintain normal vision, you must
first of all eat right, spend more time
outdoors, and do physical exercises. Daylight should freely enter the room through clean window glass. In sunny weather, you should use dark glasses. In addition, it is very important to prevent eye strain. Working too long at the computer, sitting in front of the TV for a long time, or reading while lying down can also impair vision.


146. Sensory system dysfunction


Hearing impairment Earwax is secreted in the external auditory canal, where dust and microorganisms are retained. Due to the accumulation of earwax, a plug may form that impairs hearing. In no case should this sulfur be removed with hard objects, as this can damage the eardrum. You should consult a doctor. Excessively loud sounds and prolonged noise are very harmful to hearing, the latter is especially harmful, leading to deafness and even deafness. Some infectious diseases (tonsillitis, flu) cause inflammation of the middle ear. Their pathogens can penetrate there through the passage connecting the middle ear and pharynx.


disruption of the balance system. Motion sickness Motion sickness manifests itself as dizziness, car, sea, air or railway sickness. It is characterized by general malaise, a feeling of discomfort in the stomach area, loss of appetite, the appearance of cold sweat, dizziness, nausea, sometimes vomiting. According to the definition of scientists, motion sickness is a normal reaction of a healthy person who does not have any organic or functional disorders to the influence of an unusual type of movements of a certain intensity and duration.


Taste disorders Loss of taste occurs in the case of various diseases that affect the oral cavity or brain. The most common is a decrease in taste sensitivity - hypogeusia. Cases of taste arousal - parageusia are often observed, when patients eat something that causes disgust in healthy people.


Both various diseases and excessive exposure to stimuli can lead to disturbances in the functioning of sensory systems. To prevent diseases of the sensory system organs, one should adhere to a healthy lifestyle, avoid bad habits and consult a doctor in a timely manner..
