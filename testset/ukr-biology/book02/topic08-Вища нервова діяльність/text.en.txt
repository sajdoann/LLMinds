Higher nervous activity

Before moving on to the study of higher nervous activity in humans, recall what manifestations of complex behavior can be observed in animals. What animals are characterized by complex social behavior? What advantages does such behavior give these animals?


Nervous processes
The work of the human brain is built on the interaction of two
main processes - excitation and inhibition. In the process of excitation, individual neurons or groups of neurons release their energy and generate signals that spread to other nerve cells. The process of inhibition is the reverse - it stops the process of releasing energy in neurons and prevents the spread of excitation to other neurons. For example, a person saw an apple - the eye receptors transmitted a signal to the brain. This signal caused excitation in the neurons of the visual cortex, which spread it to other groups of neurons responsible for recognizing objects, and the person realized that he was seeing an apple, not a pear. After that, the processes of inhibition were activated, and those neurons whose work was no longer needed stopped producing signals.


indicators of nervous processes The work of the brain in all people is built on the interaction of excitation and inhibition. But this interaction occurs in different people in different ways. The indicators by which nervous processes differ are strength, mobility, and balance. The value of these indicators was established and studied by the Nobel Prize winner I. P. Pavlov (Fig. 43.1).


150. Higher nervous activity


Fig. 43.1. I. P. Pavlov substantiated the existence of different types of nervous system


In his opinion, the strength of nervous processes is the ability of nerve cells to adequately respond to very strong stimuli. Mobility is the speed of transition from excitation to inhibition or, conversely, inhibition to excitation. And equilibrium is the ratio of the strength
of the processes of excitation and inhibition. Having established
these indicators, I. P. Pavlov identified three strong and one weak type of the nervous system. At the same time, strong types differed from each other in the balance and mobility of nervous processes. These types of the nervous system coincided in their characteristics with the four types of human temperament, which were described by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates (Fig. 43.2). Thus, I. P. Pavlov established the scientific basis for the ¬
features of the higher nervous activity of a person, which were discovered through observations in Ancient Greece.


Fig. 43.2. Hippocrates introduced the concept of "temperament" into scientific circulation.


Temperament and its types Temperament is an individual typological characteristic of a person, which is manifested in the strength, mobility and balance of the course of his mental processes. There are four main types of temperament (nervous system) - sanguine (lively), phlegmatic (calm), choleric (unrestrained) and melancholic (weak) (Fig. 43.3, p. 152). Sanguine (lively type) has a strong, balanced, mobile type of nervous system. People of this type are characterized by sufficient strength of nervous processes, which is manifested in energy and perseverance ¬
on the way to achieving the goal. They are characterized by self-control, which is an indicator of a sufficient balance of nervous processes. At the same time, they have significant mobility of nervous processes, as evidenced by the ability to quickly rebuild their habits and preferences, based
on specific life circumstances.
Phlegmatic (calm type) has a strong, balanced, but inert nervous system. People belonging to this type are distinguished


151. Topic 9


Fig. 43.3. Reaction of people with different types of temperament to the same event (according to Bidstrup's drawing)


primarily by slowness of action. They have a certain conservatism of behavior, which indicates low mobility of nervous processes. Choleric (unrestrained type) has a strong, but unbalanced nervous system. People of this type are characterized by the ardor with which they perform work; they work inspiredly, but often any trifle can bring everything to naught, which indicates an imbalance of nervous processes with a predominance of excitement. That is why the concept of mobility of nervous processes is not used to characterize this type. Melancholic (weak type) is distinguished by a general weakness of the nervous system, for the characterization of which such indicators as balance and mobility of
nervous processes are not used.
A feature of this type is the rapid development of inhibition under the influence of even moderate stimuli. In a person, the features of the weak type are manifested primarily in indecision ¬
and inability to insist on their own. The type of nervous system is innate, and it is completely impossible to change it. However, I. P. Pavlov proved the possibility of correcting individual typological properties.


Character Temperament is that feature of a person that he inherits from his parents. This is a feature of his nervous system. But the human nervous system is very flexible. Its main property is the ability to adapt to a wide variety of conditions that arise during a person's life. Therefore, during the development of a person, his character is formed on the basis of his temperament and other features of the organism.


152. Higher nervous activity


Character is a set of stable individual psychological characteristics of a person that are formed throughout life and are manifested in his activities and interactions with other people. There are several characteristic features that determine the peculiarities of a person's character. First, this is a person's attitude towards other people (sociability, sensitivity, respect, etc.). Second, this is a person's attitude towards work and his business (responsibility, conscientiousness, hard work, etc.). Third, this is a person's attitude towards himself (self-criticism, pride, selfishness, etc.). Fourth, this is a person's attitude towards things (neatness, sloppiness, care, etc.). Evaluating a person according to these characteristics, we determine the main features of his character.


The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates (460–377 BC) believed that the optimal
ratio of four “juices of the body” — blood ( sanguis ), lymph ( phlegma ), bile ( chole ), and black bile ( melan chole ) — determines human health, while a violation of their proportional distribution causes various diseases.


The work of the human brain is based on the interaction of two main processes — excitation and inhibition. The indicators by which these nervous processes differ in different people are strength, mobility, and balance. Analyzing these differences, I. P. Pavlov identified four types of the nervous system, which in their characteristics coincided with the four types of human temperament, which were described by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates..TOPIC 9


Reflexes


44


Before moving on to the study of human reflex activity, remember what reflexes can be observed in animals. What advantages does the manifestation of reflexes give to animals? What other forms of behavior can be observed in animals?


Human reflexes A reflex is the simplest unconscious reaction of a living organism to irritation of receptors, which occurs with the participation of the central nervous system. There are unconditioned and conditioned reflexes. Unconditioned reflexes are inherent in all people and manifest themselves in everyone the same way. Conditioned reflexes are produced by each person individually.


Unconditioned reflexes
Unconditioned reflexes are the adaptation of the human body to situations that can occur quite often in their life and to which they can respond with very simple actions. That is why they are hereditary. After all, the body must react to some situations in a completely specific way. For example, when a person leaves a dark room into the light, many light rays enter their pupil at once, which can damage the photoreceptors of the retina. Therefore, in response to a sudden change in lighting, the size of the pupils decreases sharply due to the work of the reflex arc, which sends a signal to one of the eye muscles. This occurs without the participation of human consciousness. Among the unconditioned reflexes of a person, several groups can be distinguished. For example, respiratory reflexes (sneezing and coughing to remove foreign objects from the respiratory tract), protective (pulling your hand away from a hot object), food (saliva secretion in case food gets into your mouth), orienting (turning your head to sound or light), etc. Unconditioned reflexes greatly facilitate a person's life. They allow the body to react very quickly, almost instantly, if necessary, but they are not able to ensure complete adaptation of a person to constantly changing living conditions. However, such adaptation occurs due to conditioned reflexes that are formed during the individual life of each person.


154. Reflexes


Conditioned reflexes Conditioned reflexes are complex adaptive reactions that are developed in the process of human life on the basis of unconditioned reflexes. Unlike unconditioned reflexes, conditioned reflexes are not characterized by constancy. They can arise and disappear depending on specific conditions. These reflexes are formed with the participation of the cerebral cortex. To develop conditioned reflexes, a combination of two stimuli is required: a conditioned, or indifferent, which does not affect life in any way, and an unconditional, which turns on one of the unconditioned reflexes. For example, a person begins to salivate when
he sees a lemon. The appearance of a lemon in this case is an indifferent
stimulus, and its sour taste is an unconditioned one, which causes an unconditioned reflex - salivation. Note that a conditioned reflex can be developed only when an indifferent stimulus precedes a stimulus that causes an unconditioned reflex (in our case: a person sees a lemon - salivation occurs). Conditioned reflexes are an example of acquired behavior. They can be developed not only on the basis of unconditioned, but also other conditioned reflexes that arose earlier. In this case, a previously formed reflex plays the role of an unconditioned stimulus. On the basis of such a conditioned reflex, another reflex can be developed, and then another, etc. Let's say a driver brakes, noticing a red traffic light. The reaction to a red light is a conditioned reflex, on the basis of which another conditioned reflex arises - pressing the brakes to stop the car. The


simplest nervous reactions of the human body are reflexes. There are conditioned and unconditioned reflexes. Unconditioned reflexes are hereditary and manifest in all people. Conditioned reflexes are developed in the process of a person's life on the basis of unconditioned or other conditioned reflexes..TOPIC 9


Instincts


45


Before moving on to the study of human instincts, remember how instincts manifest in animals. What examples of instinctive behavior of animals do you know? Is the mating behavior of birds instinctive? Can seasonal
migrations of animals be called instinctive behavior?


What is instinct? Instinct is a chain of consecutive unconditioned reflexes, which is one of the forms of human adaptation to life conditions. This is an innate form of behavior. Instincts are characterized by stereotyped actions, the impetus for which is external stimuli. In unchanging conditions, instincts are useful, but unconscious, automatic actions become useless if the situation changes. Units of instinctive behavior are certain sequences of actions in a situation that activates this behavior. For example, people who cheer for their team at competitions often turn on instinctive programs of primate behavior in a group that protects its territory. These programs also include the tendency to make loud cries (especially if they are rhythmic).


Instinctive programs of behavior in children Children have hundreds of instinctive programs that ensure their survival in the early stages of life. True, some of them have lost their former significance, but most are still very important today. For example, a child's development of speech is provided by a special complex instinctive program. The need to have parents is also a tough instinctive program that is extremely important for the survival of our species. By the way, one of the very first programs that is turned on after the birth of a child is the program for recognizing and remembering the mother. Manifestations of instinctive programs in childhood include many popular games and bizarre children's habits. Building play shelters and "houses", swinging on a swing, collecting all sorts of things in your pocket (buttons, stones, scraps of paper, etc.) are all manifestations of instinctive behavioral programs.


156. Instincts


Instinctive behavioral programs in adults and adolescents
Instinctive behavioral programs also work in adulthood. Remember how men act when they want to attract a woman's attention. Regardless of the culture they represent, the pattern of their actions will be approximately the same, since it is determined by an instinctive program. The teenage period in a person’s life is very interesting from the point of view of analyzing our behavior. At this time, the body undergoes significant restructuring, the level of hormones in the blood is extremely unstable, which leads to sharp mood swings. The situation in society also changes, the need for self-affirmation increases. All this triggers the active work of innate adaptation programs, the manifestations of which are well known to all parents and teachers. This is both increased conflict, and incomprehensible behavior, and the desire to stand out. This is exactly what the manifestations of the work of instinctive programs look like. But their specific form depends on the social environment and life circumstances of a particular person.


Instinctive behavioral programs. Learning An important component of adolescence is the learning process. For the last several million years, the survival of our ancestors depended on their ability to learn and the successful adoption of the experience of previous generations. Those who could not or did not want to learn died first. It is not surprising that our hereditary educational programs were significantly influenced by natural selection. The effectiveness of learning is significantly increased if a person who is determined by instinctive programs as having more experience or a higher social status teaches.


Many human actions are based on sets of standard behavioral programs that have come down to us from our ancestors. They are influenced by the peculiarities of physiological processes that can occur differently, depending on the age or gender of a person. Knowledge of these factors greatly facilitates understanding the peculiarities of the behavior of other people. TOPIC 9


Language. Learning and Memory


46


Before moving on to the study of language, learning and human memory, remember how animals communicate with each other. What advantages does the ability to communicate give animals? Can animals learn? Are animals able to remember something?


human signaling systems. Language Higher nervous activity, in particular, is based on two signaling systems that ensure human interaction with reality. Both of these systems are special forms of activity of the cerebral cortex, which manifests itself in reflex reactions. The first signaling system is characterized by reactions that arise as a result of the influence of external factors on the sensory systems of the body. But the second signaling system is determined by reflex reactions to words. For example, when you salivate at the smell of freshly baked buns, this is an example of how the first signaling system worked. The result of the work of the second signaling system is the secretion of saliva when the word “bun” is pronounced in your presence. Language is a system of special signs and means of communication between people. It was formed on the basis of sounds that a person has learned to pronounce. However, language is not limited to sounds alone: in modern society, writing is of great importance - the graphic component of language. In addition, there is a language of signs, a language of colors, etc.


Types of learning Learning has always been one of the main factors of human survival. Those who learned better survived more often in the struggle against the forces of nature, so during its existence, humanity has invented various
methods of learning.
The simplest type of learning is dogmatic, when knowledge is acquired by rote memorization, without any attempts to understand what is being learned. Because of this approach, this type of learning is the least effective, and it does not contribute to a person’s mental development in any way (Fig. 46.1).


158. Language. Learning and Memory


Fig. 46.1. Dogmatic learning was widespread not in the Middle AgesFig. 46.2. Biological tournament - an example of problem-based learning


During explanatory-illustrative learning, the perception of new information occurs with its simultaneous generalization. Usually, in this case, you are offered practical exercises or educational material with illustrations, thanks to which you can quickly and firmly assimilate the information. However, this type of learning does not contribute to the formation of creative thinking. But problem-based learning is carried out through solving educational or real problems. In order to solve them, you have to not only remember what you already know, but also learn to search for information yourself. This type of learning requires the active use of all other forms of learning (Fig. 46.2).


Fig. 46.3. Reciting a poem is an example of verbal-logical memory


Memory Any learning makes sense only when
the information you have received is remembered.
Such memorization is possible only with the involvement of human memory mechanisms. Memory is a mental phenomenon that consists in the preservation and subsequent reproduction of past experience, which makes it possible to use it again in the process of human life. There are several ways to classify memory according to different principles. For the types of memory according to the content of the material being memorized, see the table (p. 160).


159. Topic 9


Types of memory according to the content of the material being memorized


Type of memory Features


Motor Memory for posture and body movement. It is the basis for the formation of walking, dancing, playing a musical instrument and other skills


Emotional Memory for emotions and feelings. It makes it possible to store emotions and feelings that have arisen previously and restore a certain emotional state in the event of a repeated situation. Traces in emotional memory are not emotions and feelings themselves, but the events that caused them.


Image Memory for visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile images. It
stores pictures of the surrounding world, sounds, smells that
were once perceived by a person. The images contained in memory become simpler over time, lose their brightness, and become more generalized.


Verbal-logical Memory for thoughts, judgments, patterns, and connections between objects and phenomena of reality. This type of memory is closely related to speech and thinking and is formed together with them. With its help, verbal information is stored and reproduced. It is possible to memorize texts verbatim, as well as memorize only their content (Fig. 46.3, p. 159). You can learn


about the types of memory by the time of storage of the material being memorized ¬


from the table.


Types of memory by the time of storage of information


Type of memoryFeatures


Instantaneous (sensory) Stores information for a very short time (from 0.3 to 2 s) and depends on how reality is reflected at the level of receptors. With the help of this type of memory, a person retains a picture of the external world for a very short time.


Short-termRetains information that comes to it from immediate and long
-term memory. The time of storage of information in it is from 15 to
30 seconds. This memory stores only what a person's attention is directed to


. Long-termPractically unlimited in the volume and duration of information storage. This is the main "repository" of human experience. It receives material from short-term memory, but it does not remain there in a permanent form. This material is continuously transformed: generalized, classified, combined into semantic groups


. Types of memory according to the purpose of further activity using the material being memorized are described in the table.

Type of memoryFeatures


Involuntary is the product of activity not directly aimed at memorizing the material. If, while viewing the news on the Internet, you also accidentally remember that cacti come from America, then this will be an example of involuntary memory .


Voluntary is the product of a special — mnemonic — activity aimed
at memorization. When you memorize a poem to recite
in class tomorrow, this is an example of voluntary memory


. The volume of short-term memory is limited. Studies have shown that it can hold only 7 ± 2 structural units (individual letters, words, objects) at a time. In chimpanzees, for example, short-term memory is much smaller: it can hold only 2–3 structural units at a time. Languages are divided into natural and artificial. Natural languages arise naturally, are created by a certain people over a long period of time. Natural languages include Ukrainian, English, Chinese, and many other languages. Artificial languages are created specifically to facilitate international communication. Artificial languages include Esperanto, Interlingua, Lojban, etc. There are more than six thousand languages in the world. Their exact number is difficult to determine, because it is not always possible to say clearly whether a certain dialect is a separate language or just a dialect. Esperanto is an artificial language that was created by the Polish doctor L. Zamenhof in 1887. Currently, Esperanto is used in 121 countries around the world.


Language is a system of special signs and a means of communication between people. It is actively used in learning processes. There are different types of learning - dogmatic, explanatory-illustrative, problem-based. Any learning takes place with the participation of memory mechanisms. There are many types of memory that are distinguished according to different principles..TOPIC 9


Thinking and Consciousness


47


Before moving on to studying the features of human thinking and consciousness, remember how their nervous system is constructed. What part of the nervous system
is responsible for mental activity? Why are there
so many furrows and convolutions in the cerebral cortex?


Functional asymmetry of the brain Studies have revealed a qualitative feature of the human brain - functional asymmetry. It was found that the left and right hemispheres are not the same in their functional significance: the right is mainly responsible for figurative thinking, the left for abstract. The function of the left hemisphere is reading and counting, predominantly operating with symbolic information (words, symbols, numbers, etc.). The right hemisphere operates with figurative information, provides orientation in space, perception of music, emotional attitude to perceived and perceived objects.


Acquired human behavior Typical forms of acquired behavior include dynamic stereotypes, skills (skills) and habits. A dynamic stereotype is necessary for the successful interaction of the organism with the environment. The repetition of identical movements and actions, identical acts of behavior, similar reactions of the organism ensures its success in activity, satisfaction of its needs. A person usually gets used to a certain way of acting, develops a certain way of perceiving, remembering, thinking. An example of a dynamic stereotype is the gait, handwriting, posture, which are developed in each person. A skill is the ability to perform actions in accordance with given criteria (for example, quality), acquired in the process of learning or life practice (Fig. 47.1). The first stage in developing a skill is a skill, which is formed by repeatedly repeating the necessary sequence of actions in standard conditions. An example of such a skill can be, say, the ability to sew with a needle. If this skill becomes automatic, it will turn into a skill.


162. Thinking and consciousness


Fig. 47.1. The ability to ride a bicycle is a skillFig. 47.2. Biting nails is a bad habit


Habits, like skills, are developed through exercise. Thanks to this, a person becomes able to perform a certain action rationally, with due accuracy and speed, without unnecessary expenditure of physical and neuro-psychological energy (Fig. 47.2.). But, unlike skills, habits are not developed purposefully, but arise due to simple repeated repetition of monotonous actions that a person performs unconsciously. For example, when you casually glance in the mirror before leaving the house - this is a habit.


ThinkingThinking is a mental process of independent search and discovery of something essentially new. That is, it is a process of mediation and generalization of the reflection of reality during its analysis and synthesis. It arises on the basis of practical activity and experience. The following types of thinking are distinguished: visual-active, theoretical, visual-figurative, practical, verbal-logical, creative. Visual-active thinking is the solution of tasks presented in a visual form, through practical actions. For example, let's imagine that your task is to assemble a certain figure from cubes. If you simply assemble the cubes together in an arbitrary order until, after a certain number of attempts, you form the desired figure, this will be an example of the use of visual-active thinking (Fig. 47.3, p. 164). Visual-figurative (figurative, spatial) thinking is solving problems by idealizing their conditions. An example of such thinking would be your attempts to assemble a figure from cubes mentally without moving them from their place. Verbal-logical thinking is the theoretical mastery of reality, which has the form of reasoning and is carried out through such mental


163
. Topic 9


Fig. 47.4. Verbal-logical thinking is used during a game of chessFig. 47.3. Assembling a construction set is an example of visual-action thinking


of actions such as analysis, synthesis, abstraction, generalization, comparison. That is, if, when solving a problem with cubes, you first consider the principle by which the cubes are connected, divide them into groups that will be placed in certain parts of the figure, then this will be an example of verbal-logical thinking (Fig. 47.4.). Theoretical thinking can be considered a type of verbal-logical thinking. It is a means of purposeful theoretical mastery of reality, its reproduction in concepts. Theoretical thinking is aimed, as a rule, at building a generalized and largely conscious image of the world. Each type of thinking is implemented with the help of certain psychological mechanisms - components of the thinking process. Consciousness


Consciousness is a reflection in the human psyche of ideal images of reality, of one's activities, of oneself. It should not be identified with the entire psyche. This is a special mental process or their set, a form of mental activity, focused on the reflection and transformation of reality. A necessary component of consciousness is knowledge, and without it there is no consciousness. To realize any object means to include it in the system of one's knowledge and attribute it to a certain class of objects, phenomena. Another necessary component of consciousness is a person's experience of what is significant for him in the surrounding reality. Consciousness is not given to a person from birth. It is formed not by nature, but by society. The phenomena of the human psyche are very diverse. Mental activity
may not reach the level of consciousness - the so-called experiential, or


164. Thinking and consciousness


preconscious, state. It can also fall below the threshold of consciousness - this is subconscious. The totality of mental phenomena in human states that lie outside the sphere of reason, are not accountable to it and, at least at a particular moment, are not subject to control, belongs to the unconscious. Consciousness in humans performs extremely important functions. Thanks to it, we accumulate knowledge about nature, society and ourselves. Also, with the help of consciousness, a person can predict and model the future and create non-existent forms. It is to human consciousness that we must thank the appearance of ships and airplanes, cars and computers - things that do not exist in nature, but man was able to imagine them and embody them in reality. Another important function of consciousness is self-control. It is human consciousness that regulates his behavior and relationships with the surrounding world. Therefore, we do not conflict with everyone in a row. Consciousness helps us understand that a person is part of society and cannot exist without other people. And for normal coexistence, it is necessary to be able to find compromises and identify common interests.


In 90% of adults, speech functions are localized in the right hemisphere of the brain. This localization is characteristic of 95% of right-handed people and 70% of left-handed people.


The human brain is characterized by functional asymmetry: its right and left halves have a certain specialization. Acquired forms of behavior play a large role in human life - dynamic stereotypes, skills, habits. The highest forms of human mental activity are thinking and consciousness..Topic 9


Sleep. Biorhythms


48


Before moving on to studying the features of sleep and human biorhythms, remember what biorhythms animals have. Do animals sleep? Can seasonal migrations of animals be considered manifestations of biorhythms?


What is sleep? Sleep is a physiological state that periodically occurs in humans and animals; it is characterized by an almost complete absence of reactions to external stimuli, a decrease in the activity of a number of physiological processes. In the process of human life, sleep performs an important function of restoring physical and mental strength. However, this does not mean that the human brain is not working at this time. Sleep is represented by several special physiological states of the brain, during which the information that a person received before the onset of sleep is actively processed. There are normal (physiological) sleep and several types of pathological sleep (narcotic, lethargic, etc.).


Stages of sleep There are five stages of sleep in total. To study them, electroencephalograms (EEG) are used - recordings of electrical signals of the brain, which are made using a special device (electroencephalograph) (Fig. 48.1). These recordings reflect the activity of brain neurons (Fig. 48.2).
The first stage is wakefulness or
falling asleep, during which the eyelids close, the muscles relax, and the person is in a state of dozing. The second stage is the phase of superficial sleep. This is a state of shallow sleep, during

which a person is easily awakened. The third and fourth stages correspond to the phases of deep sleep. At this time, it is more difficult to wake a person. These four stages are also called the stages of synchronous, or quiet, sleep (REM sleep). The fifth stage is the fast stage of sleep, which is also called the phase of desynchronized sleep, or REM sleep (REM sleep). In this phase of sleep, the skeletal muscles are relaxed, and the muscles that ensure the movement of the eyeball are activated, and rapid eye movements occur behind closed eyelids. Dreams usually appear at this stage. Dreams are a special period, a state of sleep, when a person perceives a certain reality projected by the brain, which can include all types of sensations. A person who is sleeping, as a rule, does not understand that he is in a dream and is not able to control the course of dream events. The successive stages of PRO- and SRO-sleep are repeated during the night four to seven times, depending on the duration of sleep.


sleep disordersSleep disorders occur due to a violation of the process of falling asleep and the duration of sleep (insomnia), and pathological sleep also belongs to this. Insomnia is a condition that is usually characterized by the inability to fall asleep, despite the fact that circumstances allow it. Insomnia significantly reduces the quality of a person's life and affects his working capacity, which determines the medical and social significance of this problem. A person suffering from insomnia experiences drowsiness


167. Topic 9


during the day, decreased work productivity, and over time, constant fatigue and nervousness develop. An example of pathological sleep is lethargy, a painful state similar to sleep. During lethargy, a person has no external reactions at all, breathing is almost inaudible, and the pulse is weak. In such a state, the patient can usually stay from several hours to several weeks, and in some cases, months and years. There have been cases when a person in a lethargic state — without signs of life and heartbeat — was mistakenly recognized as dead. Another unusual phenomenon associated with sleep is somnambulism (sleepwalking). This condition is manifested in the movements that a person makes in a dream. In most cases, people in a state of somnambulism simply talk in their sleep. But sometimes they can even walk with their eyes open, although they continue to sleep. It is better not to wake a person in such a state. She should be carefully led back to bed. The development of such a condition can be provoked by significant irritation of a person or severe stress the day before.


BiorhythmsBiorhythms are called rhythms of physiological processes, inherent in all living organisms. Their nature is always individual. Depending on the duration, daily, seasonal, monthly, annual, and multi-year biorhythms are distinguished. That is, for daily rhythms, the cyclicity of phase repetition is approximately a day, for monthly rhythms - a month, etc. An example of a daily biorhythm is the alternation of sleep and wakefulness, and a monthly one is the menstrual cycle in women. Without biorhythms, normal interaction of body systems is impossible. Therefore, they can be used to draw conclusions about the general state of health. If a biorhythm is disturbed, pathology begins. For example, let's consider daily and seasonal biorhythms. Depending on the nature of daily biorhythms, people are divided into several types. The most common of them, you probably know, are "owls", "larks" and "pigeons". "Owls" go to bed late, are most active in the afternoon or in the evening and at night. "Larks
" get up early, and are most active in the morning. "Pigeons" are equally
active at different times of the day. Seasonal biorhythms are of great importance for humans. They determine the dependence of the occurrence of certain diseases on the season. For example, every autumn, as well as in spring, exacerbations of stomach ulcers, allergies and rheumatism become more frequent.


168.sleep. Biorhythms


In case of violation of the synchronicity of any biorhythms, well-being sharply worsens and immunity weakens. For example, very often in people who belong to the morning types, but work at night or during the day, the activity of the cardiovascular system and thermoregulation is disrupted. They constantly feel tired, weak, become easily excitable, their body does not recover during rest. In addition, they are more likely than others to become “victims” of exacerbations of chronic diseases and colds.


During the REM sleep stage, a person is quite easy to wake up, but during the third and fourth stages, it is difficult: complete awakening occurs within 5 minutes or longer, the person may be confused and disoriented.


Approximately 20–25% of the total sleep duration is occupied by the REM sleep stage (REM sleep), 3–5% by the first stage, 50–60% by the second stage, 10–20% by the third and fourth. With age, the third and fourth stages become shorter, after 70 years the fourth stage is practically absent, and the third is minimal.


The science that studies dreams and dreaming is called oneirology.


Sleep is a physiological state that periodically occurs in humans and is characterized by an almost complete absence
of reactions to external stimuli, a decrease
in the activity of a number of physiological processes. In total, five stages of sleep are distinguished. There are normal sleep and several types of pathological sleep (narcotic, lethargic, etc.). Biorhythms are the rhythms of physiological processes inherent in all living organisms. There are daily, seasonal, monthly, annual, and perennial biorhythms..Generalization on the topic "Higher nervous activity"
