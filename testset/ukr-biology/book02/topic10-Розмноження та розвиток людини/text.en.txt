Reproductive system

Before moving on to the study of the human reproductive system, remember how animals reproduce. What organs are part of the reproductive systems of vertebrates? What hormones affect the development of human sexual characteristics?


Sex and sexual characteristics Sex is a set of characteristics that ensure sexual reproduction and distinguish male and female individuals of the same species. Individuals of different sexes differ from each other in primary and secondary sexual characteristics. Primary sexual characteristics are distinctive anatomical and morphological features of the organism that ensure the formation of corresponding gametes and fertilization. Primary sexual characteristics include the difference in the structure of the gonads, genital tract, and external genital organs. They are listed in the table.

Secondary sexual characteristics are distinctive anatomical and morphological features of the body that play a certain role in the processes of development of the body and the regulation of physiological processes that occur differently in individuals of different sexes. Thus, in women, unlike men, the mammary glands are well developed, and the pelvic bones are more powerful. In men, most of the body weight is muscle (40% versus 23% in women). In addition
, men often grow beards and mustaches. A secondary characteristic
is the location of body hair, which also differs in women and men. Some secondary characteristics are given in the table.

and around the shoulder girdle


Genital organs
As you already know, human genital organs are divided into male
and female. Both men and women have external and internal genital organs. The main function of the genital organs is to ensure the reproduction process, i.e. the formation of male and female sex cells, bearing the fetus in women and the secretion of specific secretions in men.


Internal genital organs The internal genital organs of men are the testicles with appendages, the genital ducts (vas deferens and epididymis), the accessory sex glands (seminal vesicles, prostate gland, glands of the bulb of the urethra), and the urethra (Fig. 55.1b, p. 192). The internal female genital organs include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina (Fig. 55.1a, p. 192). The ovaries are paired, almond-shaped gonads. Female sex cells, the ova, are formed and mature in them. The ovaries also produce sex hormones, such as estradiol and progesterone. To the abdominal

. External genitalia The external male genitalia include the penis (penis) and scrotum. The penis (penis) is a cylindrical organ designed to excrete urine and seminal fluid (sperm). This organ is divided into the head, on which the external urethral opening is located, the root (the place where the penis is fixed to the pelvic bones) and the body (the part of the organ that lies between the root and the head). The scrotum is a skin, sac-like formation in which the testicles with appendages and the initial sections of the spermatic cords are located. The external female genital organs include the labia majora and minora and the clitoris. The labia majora are paired massive folds of skin, quite elastic, which run parallel to each other and limit the pubic slit on the sides. The labia minora are paired thin folds of skin located inside the labia majora, parallel to them, but thinner and shorter. The clitoris is a small finger-like protrusion located between the anterior adhesion of the lips and the external opening of the female urethra and consists of a head, body and leg.


germ cellsMale germ cells are spermatozoa. These are motile cells that have three parts — head, neck, and tail (Fig. 55.2).

The tail contains special proteins that ensure the movement of the spermatozoa. And the neck contains mitochondria, which produce energy that is used for movement. The head of the cell contains a nucleus with hereditary material and a special organelle - acrosome. It is necessary for the sperm to overcome the egg shell during fertilization: enzymes contained in the acrosome dissolve this shell.
Female sex cells are eggs (Fig. 55.3).
The egg is much larger than the sperm. It contains nutrients that provide the first divisions of the future embryo, and does not have a flagellum. The hereditary material of the egg is contained in the nucleus. Outside it is surrounded by special shells that are formed during the development of the egg in the ovary. They prevent the penetration of more than one sperm into the egg and contribute to the rooting of the embryo in the mucous membrane of the uterus.


People of different sexes differ in primary and secondary sexual characteristics. Primary sexual characteristics include internal and external genital organs. These organs ensure the process of reproduction, including the formation of sex cells. Male sex cells are sperm, and female sex cells are eggs..TOPIC 11


How the reproductive system works


56


Before moving on to studying the work of the reproductive system, remember what organs are part of it. What sex hormones are produced in the human body? Which hormones stimulate the development of male and female secondary characteristics?


Formation of sex cellsSpermatozoa are formed in the male sex glands, the testicles, starting from the period of puberty until the cessation of
sexual activity of the organism.
Reproduction of primary sex cells, from which eggs are formed, occurs only during embryonic development. After birth, a woman's body contains approximately 400 thousand immature primary sex cells. During puberty, these cells begin to develop. Usually, only one egg matures during one menstrual cycle.


Menstrual cycleThe menstrual cycle is a natural cyclical change in a woman's body that occurs at regular intervals and manifests itself externally in the form of menstruation. Menstruation is the periodic appearance of unclear and short-term bloody discharge from the genital tract, characteristic of a healthy, non-pregnant woman. The average duration of the menstrual cycle is 28 days. Each normal menstrual cycle is a preparation of a woman's body for pregnancy. Menstrual bleeding is a consequence of the tearing of the mucous membrane of the uterus - the endometrium. The first menstruation in a girl usually occurs at the age of 12-14. The cessation of menstruation is observed in women during pregnancy and in many of them - after childbirth during breastfeeding. In old age, women begin to gradually fade away the menstrual function - menopause occurs.

Fig. 56.1. Menstrual


cycle Phases of the menstrual cycle and its regulation The menstrual cycle includes four phases: menstrual, postmenstrual, ovulatory and premenstrual (Fig. 56.1). During the menstrual phase, the uterine mucosa is rejected and removed from the body. In the postmenstrual phase, this membrane is restored. In the ovulatory phase, under the influence of hormones, one of the follicles — vesicles in which eggs are formed — actively develops in the ovary. After the formation of the egg is completed, it leaves the follicle. This process is called ovulation. In the premenstrual phase, the so-called corpus luteum — a temporary organ of internal secretion — is formed from the follicle that the egg has left. It produces hormones necessary for the normal course of pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum is reduced and the cycle begins again. The menstrual cycle is regulated by several organs working in concert. The pituitary gland produces a number of the most important hormones, two of which directly regulate the work of the ovaries: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The ovaries are responsible for the maturation of the egg and the production of sex hormones. Sex hormones produced by the ovaries affect the uterus, fallopian tubes, vagina, mammary glands, skin, fatty tissue and bones.


Fertilization Fertilization is the process of fusion of mature male (sperm) and female (egg) sex cells, as a result of which one cell is formed - a zygote, which is the beginning of a new organism (Fig. 56.2, p. 196). During sexual intercourse, 3–5 ml of semen is squirted into the vagina — a mixture of spermatozoa with secretions from the male glands. It contains 200–500 million spermatozoa, which have the property of moving against


the
flow


of fluid. From the vagina, they move into the uterus, and then into the fallopian tubes, where they meet the egg. The egg cannot move on its own. Its movements are provided by contractions of the muscles of the tube wall and the work of the cilia of the epithelium. A mature egg from a ruptured follicle first enters the abdominal cavity, and then into the fallopian tube, where fertilization usually occurs.


Pregnancy Pregnancy is a physiological state of a woman's body associated with the fertilization of the egg and the development of the embryo and fetus. Pregnancy in a woman lasts 270–280 days. During pregnancy, significant changes occur in a woman's body. The placenta is formed from the outer membranes of the fetus. The placenta, or the placental site, is an organ that connects the fetus to the mother's body during intrauterine development. It ensures the exchange of substances between the mother's body and the fetus and protects the fetus from attacks by the mother's immune system. Significant changes occur in the uterus: its size increases - not only due to stretching of the walls, but also due to an increase in muscle mass. A network of large and small vessels develops that carry blood to the placenta. The kidneys work with increased load, removing metabolic products not only of the mother but also of the fetus. In a woman, the formation of erythrocytes in the bone marrow is activated, the amount of blood increases, blood vessels dilate, and gas exchange increases. To ensure the normal functioning of the organs
and systems of the pregnant woman's body, favorable conditions for
the development of the fetus, an increased amount of nutrients and oxygen is necessary.

childbirth Childbirth is a physiological process that ends pregnancy, the exit of the mature fetus and the afterbirth (placenta and embryonic membranes) from the mother's body (Fig. 56.3).

of a child is ensured by contractions and pushing.
Contractions are periodically repeated contractions of the uterine muscles. Pushing are rhythmic contractions of the abdominal muscles that accompany contractions.


The menstrual cycle is a regular cyclical change in a woman's body that repeats at certain intervals. Externally, it manifests itself in the form of menstruation and is divided into four phases. The menstrual cycle is regulated by the endocrine system. During sexual intercourse, fertilization can occur, resulting in pregnancy. During pregnancy, a special organ, the placenta, is formed from the membranes of the fetus to ensure metabolism with the mother's body. TOPIC 11


Human Development


57


Before moving on to the study of human development processes, remember how development can occur in animals. Which animals are characterized by development with metamorphosis, and which ones without metamorphosis? In which animals, the embryo develops in the mother's body?


Ontogenesis and factors influencing it Ontogenesis is the individual development of an organism from the moment of conception to natural death or to the cessation of the existence of a single-celled organism as a result of division. The term "ontogenesis" was proposed by the German scientist E. Haeckel in 1866. Ontogenesis is based on the process of sequential and irreversible implementation of hereditary information of a particular organism.
The realization of this information (and, accordingly, the course of ontogenesis)
can be influenced by many different factors. These include environmental conditions, neurohumoral and hormonal regulation, etc.


embryonic period of development The embryonic (germinal) period lasts from the moment of formation of the zygote to the birth of the child (Fig. 57.1). During this period, all tissues and organ systems of the body are formed from a single cell. Human embryonic development has several stages: fragmentation, formation of germ layers and membranes, formation of tissues (histogenesis) and organs (organogenesis). Four to five days after fertilization, a single-layered embryo with a cavity inside enters the uterine cavity. After that, it is immersed in its mucous membrane and attached to it. This process is called implantation. The embryonic period of intrauterine development begins. First, three germinal membranes and three germinal leaves are formed. The germinal membranes are formed from some of the cells of the embryo. The outer membrane has villi with capillaries through which the embryo feeds and breathes. The inner membrane is thin and transparent, it forms a bubble, the cavity of which is filled with amniotic fluid, which protects

the embryo from mechanical damage. The outer and middle membranes participate in the formation of the placenta together with the mucous membrane of the uterus. On the 10th–14th day after fertilization, the cells of the embryo form germ layers, from which all organs and tissues are then formed. The fetus is called the organism, starting from the 9th week of intrauterine development and until the moment of birth. The fetus has its own environment, which consists of the embryonic membranes, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord. The umbilical cord is a cord-like organ that extends from the placenta and connects the fetus to the maternal organism.


postembryonic period The postembryonic period is the period of human life after birth (Fig. 57.2, p. 200). It can be divided into several stages, the duration of which differs in men and women. In addition, personal characteristics of a person, such as his heredity and lifestyle, are of great importance. External factors can also influence the duration of individual stages of ontogenesis. Therefore, the following age periods are distinguished in human life: The period of infancy (first 10 days): the organism undergoes restructuring due to adaptation to life outside the mother's body. Structures associated with metabolism through the placenta are destroyed.


199. TOPIC 11


Fig. 57.2. Postembryonic development of men


The thoracic period (10 days - 1 year) is characterized by the highest
rates of growth and development of all organ systems in the postembryonic period, as well as the strengthening of the musculoskeletal system, the formation of a large number of conditioned reflexes. Early childhood (1–3 years): high rates of growth and development of all organ systems are observed; the beginning of independent active movements; the transition to eating adult food; the development of milk teeth; the beginning of speech. At the end of the period, growth rates slow down. Early childhood (4–7 years): growth rates slow down; active accumulation of information about the surrounding world occurs; skills and abilities necessary for independent living are formed; permanent teeth develop. Second childhood (8–12 years in boys, 8–11 years in girls): relatively low growth rates; active accumulation of information about the surrounding world and formation of skills and abilities necessary for independent living continue. Adolescence (13–16 years in boys, 12–15 years in girls): beginning of the period of puberty; sharp increase in growth rates; significant hormonal changes in the body; beginning of functioning of the reproductive systems. Adolescence (17–21 years in boys, 16–20 years in girls): completion of the period of puberty; decrease in the rate of development

and the end of body growth; the reproductive systems enter a normal mode of functioning. Mature age (the first period - 22–35 years in men, 21–35 years in women): the most productive period of life; the development of abilities reaches the highest level, the work of all body systems is most effective. Mature age (the second period - 36–60 years in men, 36–55 years in women): a very productive period; fairly high physical abilities
are combined with rich experience and allow you to achieve the highest
results. At the end of the period, there is a gradual fading of the functions of the reproductive system. Old age (61–74 years in men, 56–74 years in women): the state of the body depends significantly on the characteristics of the life that a person led in previous periods. Reproductive functions in men continue to fade, in women they cease altogether. Old age (75–90 years): structural, functional and biochemical changes occur in the body, which significantly limit its capabilities. Longevity (more than 90 years): structural, functional and biochemical changes continue in the body, which limit its capabilities.


Human development consists of two main stages - embryonic and postembryonic. The period of human life after birth can be divided into several stages, the duration of which differs in men and women..TOPIC 11


Disorders of the reproductive system


58


Before proceeding to the study of disorders of the human reproductive system, remember what organs are included in it. What diseases of the urinary system can occur in humans? What is the difference between ascending and descending infections? What ways do you know about HIV transmission?


The effect of harmful substances on fetal development
The effect of harmful substances during fetal development is particularly dangerous. This is due to the fact that during a short period of embryonic development, a large number of new organs and their systems are formed in the body. During their formation, even the slightest negative impact can lead to disorders that will have serious consequences. That is why many medical drugs have restrictions on use during pregnancy. Failure to follow such precautions can lead to unpredictable results. For example, in the middle of the 20th century, the use of a sleeping pill safe for adults by pregnant women led to the birth of children with reduced limbs. You already know about the effect of smoking and alcohol on all organ systems of an adult. Imagine what consequences these bad habits can lead to for the fetus. Products contained in tobacco smoke are also dangerous for the adult body, and during pregnancy they can cause damage to the placenta or cause premature birth. Alcohol affects the development of the nervous system and can lead to the birth of children with mental disorders.


Sexually transmitted diseases Sexually transmitted diseases are very dangerous for human health. The human body does not develop immunity to these diseases, so even after recovery, a person can get sick with them again. Penetrating the body through the genital tract, the pathogens of these diseases can also disrupt the functioning of other organs. For example, the causative agent of syphilis (Fig. 58.1) affects the heart, bones, nervous system, etc.


202. Disorders of the reproductive system


Fig. 58.1. The causative agent of syphilis Fig. 58.2. The causative agent of gonorrhea


Sexually transmitted diseases can be
caused by: protozoa (trichomoniasis), bacteria (gonorrhea (Fig. 58.2) and syphilis), viruses (genital herpes), microscopic fungi (candidiasis). Some parasitic infections, such as pediculosis, can also be transmitted sexually.


HIV infection preventionThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is the causative agent of AIDS, is very dangerous. It affects the human immune system, as a result of which the body becomes defenseless against any infection. From the course of the basics of health, you know that this virus is transmitted not only sexually. But it is one of the main ones. The fact is that during sexual intercourse, microscopic damage to the mucous membranes of the genital organs very often occurs. They may not be noticeable to the naked eye, but they are like gates that allow the virus into the human body. Therefore, it is very important to refrain from unprotected sexual contact.


The human reproductive system is very vulnerable to negative influences. Harmful substances, in particular those that enter the body during smoking, as well as alcohol, can disrupt the development of the fetus. This can cause abnormalities and lead to fetal death. Sexually transmitted infections are dangerous. They can be easily avoided by leading a healthy lifestyle, but at the same time they are very difficult to cure.

The human body as a holistic system


59


Before proceeding to the study of the human body as a holistic system, recall what organ systems are part of the human body. What organ systems regulate processes in the body? What functions does the circulatory system have? What is homeostasis?


Functions that maintain the integrity of the body In fact, any function of the human body to one degree or another supports its integrity. But the most important among them are the transport, protective and regulatory. The transport function connects all organs and systems, allows you to move the necessary resources within the body and carry out humoral regulation.
The protective function ensures the maintenance of the integrity of the body.
It is responsible for the constancy of conditions in the body and protects it from the penetration of foreign bodies and dangerous substances. The regulatory function coordinates the action of all organs and systems with each other. In fact, it makes the body a single whole, a system that is able to maintain its existence for a long time.


ways to maintain homeostasisMaintaining homeostasis in the human body is achieved through the interaction of regulatory systems with the involvement of all other systems of the body. Regulatory systems usually work using the principle of opposition. Thus, the sympathetic system accelerates heart contractions, and the parasympathetic slows them down, insulin lowers the level of glucose in the blood, and glucagon increases it. This method of regulation allows you to maintain dynamic equilibrium and easily change the necessary parameters of organ function.


206. The human body as a holistic system


Fig. 59.1. Location of the organs of the endocrine system in the human body


The central nervous system plays an active role in maintaining homeostasis. It not only takes an active part in the processes of stress, nervous and humoral regulation, but also prevents homeostasis disruption by avoiding situations in which this disruption may occur. For example, if a person sees a red traffic light,
he stops. In this way,
a person avoids getting hit by a car, which, of course, would lead to a disruption of the homeostasis of his body.


The integrative function of organ systems An important function of uniting parts of the body into a single system is performed by the circulatory, nervous and endocrine systems. The circulatory system is a carrier of the body's material resources - nutrients, oxygen, metabolic products, and the nervous and endocrine systems perform a regulatory function. The nervous system regulates by transmitting impulses along the nerves. The endocrine system (Fig. 59.1) provides control processes using biologically active molecules - hormones.


The human body is a single system, the existence of which is possible only if its parts work in a coordinated manner. This allows maintaining the relative constancy of the internal conditions of the body. An important integrative role in the human body is performed by the circulatory, nervous and endocrine systems.
