Substances of living organisms. Inorganic compounds

Recall the substances that organisms need for


their vital activity. What is the importance of aqueous solutions in nature and for humans? What type of chemical bond is in a water molecule? What are ions and how are they formed?


Chemical elements of living organisms Plant and animal cells include more than 70 chemical


elements. But there are no elements in the cell that are characteristic only of living nature. These same elements are also found in inanimate nature.


All chemical elements are divided into


three groups according to their content in a living cell: macroelements, microelements, and ultramicroelements.


Content of chemical elements in living cells


Group of elements Chemical symbols of elements Percentage of the mass


of the organism, %


Macroelements H, O, C, N, P, S, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cl 10–0.001


Microelements Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Co, I, F, Ni and others


0.001–0.000001 Ultramicroelements Au, Se, Hg, U, Ra and others Less than 0.000001


The elements O, C, H, N are sometimes considered as a separate group of organogenic


elements because they are part of all organic substances and make up up to 98% of the mass of a living cell.


8. Substances of living organisms. Inorganic compounds


Inorganic substances of living organisms While studying chemistry, you learned about such groups of substances as acids


, salts, oxides, etc. All of them are common in inanimate nature, outside of living organisms. That is why they are called inorganic substances. But this does not mean that inorganic substances do not exist in living organisms at all. They exist and play a very important role in the processes of life.


Inorganic substances usually enter living organisms


from the external environment with food (in animals) or with a water solution through the surface of the organism (in plants, fungi and bacteria). But in some cases, living organisms can synthesize them independently (for example, the stomach cells of vertebrates synthesize hydrochloric acid). The functions of inorganic substances are quite diverse.


Functions of inorganic substances in the cell


Inorganic substances Functions in the cell


Hydrogen cations (H + ) Provide acid-base balance (maintain the constancy of the intracellular environment)


Cations and anions of soluble salts


Create a potential difference between the contents of the cell and
the surrounding environment, ensure the conduction of a nerve impulse


Poorly soluble salts of Calcium and Phosphorus


Form supporting structures (for example, in the bones of vertebrates)


Ions of metal elements


Are components of many hormones, enzymes and vitamins or participate in their activation


Participate in the synthesis of organic molecules


Complex inorganic compounds of Nitrogen, Calcium and Phosphorus


Inorganic compounds can be found in living organisms both


in dissolved form (in the form of ions) and in insoluble form. Dissolved forms are represented by many salts. Ions Na + , K + , Cl – and others accumulate on different sides of cell membranes and provide different charges on their surface, which makes it possible to conduct nerve impulses along the nerves.


Insoluble inorganic compounds are also important for living organisms


. For example, salts of Calcium and Phosphorus are part of the skeleton of various animals and ensure its strength (Fig. 2.1, p. 10). Without such substances, the existence of healthy teeth in humans is impossible.

Fig. 2.2. Structures of living organisms, which
consist mainly of inorganic
substances Various structures of animal organisms are


also ¬mostly built of ¬inorganic ¬
substances (Fig. 2.2).


Properties of waterThe properties of water are determined by the structural features of its molecule,


as well as by the bonds between molecules.


As you already know, in a water molecule (chemical formula - H 2 O)


there is a covalent polar bond between the Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms (Fig. 2.3). This causes the appearance of a certain negative electric charge ( δ – ) on the Oxygen atom, and a positive one ( δ + ) on the Hydrogen atoms. That is why the positively charged Hydrogen atom of one water molecule is attracted to the negatively charged Oxygen atom of another water molecule. Such a bond is called a hydrogen bond.


The hydrogen bond is approximately 15–20 times weaker than the covalent


bond. Therefore, the hydrogen bond is relatively easily broken, which happens, for example, during the evaporation of water. In the liquid state of water, the hydrogen bonds between its molecules are constantly broken and formed again.

10. Substances of living organisms. Inorganic compounds


Biological role of water In living organisms, water performs many functions: soluble,


transport, metabolic, thermoregulatory, structural.


Water is a universal solvent. Substances that participate


in most biological reactions are in the body in aqueous
solution.


The transport role of water is also very important for cells and organisms in general ¬


. In the form of an aqueous solution, substances together with water can be transported from one part of the cell to another. And between different parts of multicellular organisms, they are transported as part of special fluids (for example, as part of the blood). Evaporation of water by plant leaves causes it to move from the roots upwards. At the same time, substances dissolved in water also move.


Water molecules perform a metabolic function when they


participate in metabolic reactions (they are called biochemical reactions). The thermoregulatory function of water is extremely important for maintaining the body temperature of organisms. When, for example, a person sweats, the water that evaporates lowers his body temperature.


The structural function of water is clearly seen in the example of plants


and some invertebrates. Plants maintain the shape of leaves and grassy stems due to increased pressure in water-filled cells. And in many worms, the shape of the body is maintained due to increased water pressure in their body cavities.


Living organisms contain both organic and inorganic substances. Inorganic substances are water, salts, acids and other compounds. They play an important role in the life of living organisms. Water creates an environment in which metabolic reactions occur. Other inorganic
substances participate in the formation of the skeleton, the work of the nervous
, digestive and other systems of the body. P . Topic 1


3 Organic molecules. Biopolymers


You are already familiar with the concepts of "substance" and "


element". Recall the definitions of these terms. While studying human biology, you became familiar with the substances that the human body needs. Name them. In which products do they contain them in the largest quantities?


Organic substances of living


organisms


Chemical composition of the cell


In addition to inorganic


substances


, the cells of living organisms include


organic


substances (Fig. 3.1).


There are many organic substances in the world:


Proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids


Water, minerals (mainly salts), acids They


are contained in the bodies of both inanimate and living nature


, more than inorganic ones. There are now more than 25 million of them, and new ones are constantly being discovered or created. From the previous chapters of biology, you learned that organic substances are contained in living organisms that we consume as food, and in products of plant or animal origin. Different substances are contained in them in different quantities (Fig. 3.2).


They are formed
only in living organisms
, they can accumulate in inanimate nature after the death of living organisms (peat, humus).


You already know that all organic substances


Fig. 3.1. The chemical composition of


animal cells is divided into four main ones


Eggs are rich in proteins and lipids Potatoes are rich in carbohydrates Sunflower is rich in lipids


Fig. 3.2. Living organisms contain many organic substances


12. Organic molecules. Biopolymers


of the group: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids. The composition of all these substances necessarily includes Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H) and Oxygen (O) atoms. Organic substances may also contain atoms of Nitrogen (N) (essential components of proteins and nucleic acids), Phosphorus (P) (components of nucleic acids), Sulfur (S) (present in proteins, but absent in nucleic acids).


Features of the structure of organic substances
Molecules of organic substances differ from molecules of


inorganic substances and from each other in their structural features.


Features of the structure of molecules of organic substances


May differ from each other in the number of links in the carbon chain.


Contain chains of Carbon atoms, to which atoms of Hydrogen and other elements are attached. These chains are often called the "skeleton" of the molecule.


chain of Carbon atoms The palmitic acid molecule (CH 3 (CH 2 ) 14 COOH) contains 16 Carbon atoms.


Acetic acid (CH 3 COOH).


Often have a large size and mass.


A molecule of stearic acid (CH 3 (CH 2 ) 16 COOH) contains 18 carbon atoms.


For example, the relative molecular mass
of water is 18, and that of the protein myosin is 500,000.


Even a slight change in the relative arrangement of atoms in a molecule of an organic substance transforms it into another substance.


They exist in several forms that can easily be converted into one another. For example, different ends of long organic molecules can interact with each other and form ring-shaped molecules.


Glucose (left) and fructose (right) have the same chemical formula (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), but different molecular structures.

Fig. 3.3. Scheme of the structure of biopolymers


To a large extent, the features of the structure of organic molecules are due to


the properties of Carbon atoms, which can form four equal bonds. Such bonds make it possible to form molecules that branch easily and can have a large length. And the small size of the atom itself makes these bonds quite strong. Silicon, for example, which is the next element of group IV in the Periodic Table of D. I. Mendeleev after Carbon, forms such chains much worse, primarily because its atom has a larger radius and it forms much weaker chemical bonds.


Monomers and polymers Organic molecules are divided into two groups by their size -


small and large molecules (macromolecules). Macromolecules have a mass of more than 1000 Da (1 Da = 1 a. m.). They consist of identical (or almost identical) small organic molecules, which are called monomers (from the Greek mono - one). Another widely used name for such molecules is polymers (from the Greek poly - many).


In addition to their large mass, macromolecules are also distinguished


by the presence of at least 30 carbon atoms in one molecule.


Polymers are very common in nature. In addition, such molecules


are produced artificially by man on an industrial scale. These include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and other compounds that are well known to you from everyday life. You will learn more about them in chemistry lessons.


BiopolymersPolymers that are produced by living organisms are called


biopolymers. For example, nylon, which is produced artificially, is


14. Organic molecules. Biopolymers


are polymers, and silk, which is produced by insects, is a biopolymer. Both of them consist of small organic molecules - monomers.


The number of monomers in biopolymers can vary: from one or


two dozen for some proteins and carbohydrates to hundreds of thousands and even millions (the DNA molecule of the first human chromosome consists of 248 million pairs of nucleotides, i.e. contains 496 million monomers).


You have already become familiar with many biopolymers in previous


chapters of biology. The most famous biopolymers are proteins, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. The monomers of proteins are amino acids, carbohydrates - monosaccharides, and nucleic acids - nucleotides (Fig. 3.3).


The most common biopolymers on our planet are carbohydrates


, cellulose (produced by plants) and chitin (produced by fungi and insects). Biopolymers also include enzymes (pepsin), transport proteins (hemoglobin), reserve substances of living organisms (starch, glycogen), etc.


Some biopolymers have amazing properties due to their structure. One of such polymers is spider web. It is produced by representatives of arachnids. Given its composition, spider web belongs to proteins. But it is not a continuous thread, but has a structure like that of a rope - woven from many microfibers. The maximum load that a spider web can withstand is 2.7 GPa. The same indicator for steel is 1.5 GPa.


The main groups of organic substances in living organisms are proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids. A significant part of organic substances are biopolymers. Their molecules consist of a large number ¬of
small monomer molecules that are combined with each other. P . Topic 1


4 Proteins. Structural organization of proteins


Recall from the course of human biology what substances


should enter your body with food. Why should proteins enter the body with food in addition to carbohydrates and lipids? What functions do proteins perform in the human body? Also remember how an ionic bond is formed.


Proteins Proteins are large organic molecules,


Amino acids


Protein molecule


biopolymers. They consist of monomers - amino acids, which are connected in the form of a chain (Fig. 4.1). Amino acids are organic molecules, which necessarily include two groups of atoms - an amino group (–NH 2 ) and a carboxyl group (–COOH). These groups of atoms are attached to one carbon atom. In amino acids that are not part of proteins (and such also occur in nature), these groups can also be attached to different carbon atoms. In addition to these two groups


, another group of atoms is attached to the same carbon atom - a radical. Each amino acid has its own
radical


.


In diagrams and drawings, it is denoted by the letter R (Fig. 4.2).


The cells of living organisms contain


20 different


amino


acids


. Accordingly, there are 20 different amino acid radicals. Their formulas are given on the front cover of the textbook.

Fig. 4.3. Formation of a peptide bond between amino acid molecules


To maintain such a structure, or to stabilize it, there are


certain chemical bonds and interactions. They ensure the constancy of its configuration, and therefore its functioning. There are four levels of structural organization of a protein molecule. The primary structure is the simplest, the quaternary structure is the most complex.


Primary structure of proteinsThe primary structure of a protein ensures the combination of amino acids


into one chain. This chain has a linear structure (i.e., it has the form of a thread). The bond that connects amino acid molecules is called a peptide bond, and the chain itself is called a polypeptide. A peptide bond arises as a result of a chemical reaction between the amino group (–NH 2 ) of one amino acid and the carboxyl group (–COOH) of another amino acid (Fig. 4.3). During the formation of a peptide bond, one molecule of water is released. This bond is covalent, and therefore the strongest in a protein molecule.


Secondary structure of proteinsThe secondary structure of a protein is provided by the folding of the


β-pleated structure


of the molecule into a more compact structure. A molecule can take on two different spatial forms—helical or pleated. They have the corresponding
names: α-helical and β-pleated
structures (Fig. 4.4). In one protein molecule, different parts of it can have different versions of the secondary structure. In some parts, it can have a folded


α-helical


structure , and in others, a helical structure (Fig


.


4.5, p. 18). Moreover, the same protein molecule can sometimes be “folded” by a cell in different ways. It should be noted that some


parts


may not form secondary structures. They remain linear parts.

Fig. 4.5. A model of a protein molecule with regions that have different secondary structures


is ¬formed by water
bonds that arise between amino acid residues located nearby. From the chemistry course, you already know that hydrogen bonds arise between the Oxygen and Hydrogen atoms of different molecules.


Tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins The tertiary structure of a protein ensures the arrangement of helical and


folded regions of the molecule in space in a certain order. It is formed by bonds that arise between amino acid residues located at a large distance.


This is achieved by stabilizing the protein molecule in space


in several ways: using hydrogen, ionic, disulfide
bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4.6). But the role of hydrogen bonds in this structure is not so significant. The formation of disulfide bonds, or disulfide


bridges, is of greater importance . ¬


They are formed between two radicals of the amino acid cysteine due to the interaction of Sulfur atoms in these radicals. Disulfide bonds are quite strong and are not easily broken.

18. Proteins. Structural organization of proteins


Ionic bonds arise between oppositely charged radicals


of polar amino acids. In an aqueous environment, they are much weaker than covalent ones and can break if the pH of the medium changes.


Hydrophobic interaction occurs between radicals of hydrophobic amino


acids. Such radicals often accumulate together when a protein molecule is in an aqueous solution. Thus, hydrophobic radicals “hide” inside the molecule, and hydrophilic radicals are located
outside, in contact with the aqueous environment.


The quaternary structure of proteins occurs when several protein


molecules are combined with each other (Fig. 4.7). Thus, they form a single protein complex that performs certain functions.


Denaturation and renaturation of proteins The spatial structure of proteins can be disturbed under the influence


of changes in temperature, chemical environment, and physical factors. They lead to the sequential destruction of the quaternary, tertiary, and secondary structures of the protein. This process is called denaturation. In the case of destruction and primary structure, we speak of protein destruction. Sometimes after denaturation, the protein can independently restore its structure. This restoration of the protein structure is called renaturation.


Proteins are biopolymers that consist of amino acids. Four levels of protein structural organization are distinguished. The first level is a chain of amino acids that are connected by peptide bonds in a certain sequence. At the second level, the molecule has the form of a helical or folded structure that is stabilized in space by hydrogen bonds. At the third level, these structures are arranged in a certain way in space and stabilized by several different methods. At the fourth level, several protein molecules combine ¬
into a single structure. P. Topic 1


5 Functions of proteins. Enzymes


While studying the human digestive system, you


became familiar with some enzymes that participate in the digestion process. Remember these enzymes. What function do they perform in the digestive system? What other enzymes from those studied earlier can you recall?


Classification of proteins Proteins can be divided into two large groups according to their composition -


simple and complex. Simple proteins consist only of amino acids. Such proteins are also called proteins (Fig. 5.1). Simple proteins are histones, which form the basis of chromosomes. Albumins and globulins, which are found in blood plasma, belong to this same group.


Complex proteins (proteids), in addition to amino acid residues, also contain


a non-protein part - a prosthetic group. Such a group can be both an organic and inorganic molecule. According to the composition of such a group, different proteids are distinguished. Thus, nucleoproteins, in addition to proteins, contain nucleic acids, glycoproteins - carbohydrates, and lipoproteins - lipids. Complex proteins can also contain residues of orthophosphoric acid or atoms of metal elements. Proteins such as hemoglobin contain a large and structurally complex group of atoms - heme (Fig. 5.2). Heme includes an atom of a metal element (iron in hemoglobin). Heme provides the color of the protein molecule.


Proteins can also be divided into two large


groups according to the shape of the molecule: globular and fibrillar. Globular protein molecules have


the


appearance


of a lump. These proteins


usually


dissolve


easily in water. Most enzymes are globular proteins, and fibrillar protein molecules have the appearance of a thread. They are ¬
insoluble


. These include, for example, keratin (contained in the epidermis), collagen, and elastin (contained in the dermis).


Functions of proteins There are a lot of proteins in living organisms, and they perform


a variety of functions in them. Almost all functions of living organisms are to one
degree or another related to the work of certain groups of proteins. With the help of proteins, organisms build their structures, carry out life processes and reproduce themselves.


Functions of proteins


StructuralCatalyticRegulatory


Examples of proteins: insulin, glucagon.


Examples of proteins: collagen, keratin, elastin, mucoproteins.


Examples of proteins: trypsin, peroxidase, alcohol dehydrogenase.


They are components of the supporting ¬
structures and coverings of organisms. They are part of the tissues of the internal environment of animals. They participate in the formation of the skeleton, ligaments, skin, feathers, wool and other structures.


Protein hormones
are important regulators of metabolic processes in the body.


Protein enzymes are catalysts (accelerators) of reactions in cells. They ensure the vital activity of the organism.

Protective


Examples of proteins: antibodies ¬
, fibrinogen, thrombin


Examples of proteins: membrane receptor proteins.


Examples of proteins:
hemoglobin, hemocyanin, albumin.


Proteins are the main receptor molecules located on cell membranes. They perceive information from the environment and transmit it to cells. They


provide the transport of oxygen, fatty acids, lipids and other compounds in the body. In cells, proteins are responsible for the transport (movement) of many substances through cell membranes.


They are the most important component of the immune system. They form complexes with foreign proteins, neutralizing them. Proteins also participate in the process of blood clotting.


Motor


Storage


Toxic


Examples of proteins: actin, myosin.


Examples of proteins: egg albumin, casein.


Examples of proteins: snake venom, diphtheria toxin.


Contractile proteins provide muscle contraction.


Depending on the lifestyle ¬of the organism that
produces them, protein toxins can be both a means of defense and a means of attack.


Proteins participate in creating a reserve of substances in the body that are necessary to ensure further life.


Enzymes and their role in the cell
While studying human biology, you have already become acquainted with such


a group of proteins as enzymes. Enzymes are unique molecules. They perform the function of catalysis, that is, they change the rate of chemical reactions, and they do it extremely effectively! For example, for the interaction of atmospheric nitrogen with hydrogen in the process of synthesizing nitrogen fertilizers, modern industry uses a temperature of 500 ° C and a pressure of 350 atmospheres! This is in the presence of a catalyst - porous iron


22. Functions of proteins. Enzymes


with certain impurities. And the ordinary soil bacterium Azotobacter carries out the same reactions with the help of enzymes under normal conditions. Without high temperatures and at normal pressure.


Enzymes are needed to carry out metabolic processes in the cell


. Without them, metabolic reactions proceed extremely slowly. And often, these reactions do not occur at all without enzymes.


How do enzymes manage to achieve such success? The secret is in their


spatial structure. Any enzyme is a chain of amino acids that is folded in a certain way in space. The folding of the chain occurs in such a way that the amino acid radicals form a unique structure — the active center of the enzyme. It is in this center that reactions occur.


The amino acid radicals are arranged in space in a certain way


relative to each other. They differ in their properties, and their joint action creates conditions in which the corresponding reaction occurs extremely quickly.


In some cases, a non-protein component is also required for the enzyme to work


. This is a compound (called a cofactor) that joins the enzyme and also participates in the process of catalyzing the reaction. Often, cofactors of enzymes are vitamins.


Proteins can be divided into two large groups by molecular composition - simple and complex, and by molecular shape - into globular and fibrillar. Simple proteins consist only of amino acids, while complex proteins contain a non-protein part in addition to amino acids. This class of substances performs many functions in living organisms: structural, catalytic, protective, transport, etc. The catalytic function is performed by protein enzymes, which are extremely effective catalysts.

6 Carbohydrates


From the course of human biology, recall what substances should


enter the body with food. Why should carbohydrates enter the body with food in addition to proteins? What functions do carbohydrates perform in the human body? What negative consequences can their deficiency lead to?


What are carbohydrates?
Carbohydrates are complex organic


compounds Cellulose is a carbohydrate that forms cell walls in plant cells


, compounds whose molecules include several groups: hydroxyl (–OH), carboxyl group (–COOH) or carbonyl (–COH). The general formula of carbohydrates is C n (H 2 O) m , where n and m are natural numbers. The most common carbohydrates are glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), sucrose (C 12 H 24 O 12 ), lactose (C 12 H 22 O 11 ), cellulose, chitin, starch.


A significant part of carbohydrates is biopolymers


(


starch, cellulose, glycogen). Such biopolymers are called polysaccharides. Their monomers are small carbohydrate molecules (for example, glucose), which are called monosaccharides. Such carbohydrates contain a small number of carbon atoms (from 3 to 7 atoms in a molecule).


Often, living organisms use


carbohydrate molecules in their vital activity
that consist of two monosaccharides (for example, sucrose, which is well known to us as regular sugar). Such compounds are called disaccharides.


Lactose is a carbohydrate found in milk .


Structure and properties of carbohydrates Let us consider the features of the structure of carbohydrate molecules


and their characteristic properties using the example of specific compounds.

Fructose. Chicory, Jerusalem artichoke, sweet potato, onion, dahlias.


It should be noted that very slight differences in the way


glucose molecules are connected in polysaccharides lead to differences in their properties. It is precisely because of such slight differences that mammalian enzymes are unable to break down cellulose molecules, but can break down glycogen or starch molecules.


Biological role of carbohydrates. The main functions of carbohydrates in living organisms are structural,


protective, reserve, receptor, plastic and energy.


Structural and protective functions are performed by carbohydrates such as


cellulose and chitin. They create structures in cells and organisms
that provide shape, strength, and protection from damage. These compounds can be part of cells or


form


structures outside cells. For example, cellulose is the basis of the cell wall, and chitin forms the basis of the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is a non-cellular structure.


The reserve function is performed by glycogen (in animals and fungi) and


starch (in plants). In the form of these compounds, organisms store nutrients. The receptor function is performed by those small carbohydrate molecules that, together with proteins, form receptors on the surface of cells.


The plastic function is performed by carbohydrates such as ribose and


deoxyribose. They participate in the formation of new molecules of organic substances (nucleic acids). Many carbohydrates can perform an energy function. During the oxidation of 1 g of carbohydrates in a cell, 4.1 kcal (17.17 kJ) of energy is formed, which is then used by the cell.


Yeast does not have enzymes for the breakdown of starch molecules. But they easily convert monosaccharides or disaccharides into alcohol. Therefore, in the production of beer, malt is used - a product from germinated cereal grains. Malt contains many enzymes that break down starch to maltose. And yeast makes beer from it.


Carbohydrates are complex organic compounds. A living
cell can contain carbohydrates such as monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. They play an important role in metabolic processes (glucose, fructose) and the preservation of hereditary information (ribose, deoxyribose). They can also perform structural (cellulose, chitin) and storage (starch, glycogen) functions. P. Topic 1


7Lipids


From the course of human biology, remember what substances


should enter the body with food. Why should lipids enter the body with food in addition to proteins and carbohydrates? What functions do lipids perform in the human body? What negative consequences can their deficiency lead to?


What are lipids? Lipids are a group of substances that are united,


GlycerolFatty acids


primarily, not by chemical structure, but by physical properties. They are all water-insoluble oily or fatty substances. The most common lipids are fats, oils, waxes and steroids.


The term “fats” is not synonymous with the term


“ lipids”. Only some of the


substances


in this group are called this way. Usually, the term “fats” is used for lipids of animal origin, which remain solid at room temperature. The term “oils” is used for lipids of plant origin, which remain liquid at room temperature.


Fig. 7.1. Structure of a lipid molecule


Stearic acid (saturated)


Structure and properties of lipids Many lipids are composed of many


solid at room temperature


Oleic acid (unsaturated)


Liquid at room temperature


atomic alcohol glycerol (C 3 H 5 (OH) 3 ) and fatty
acids (Fig. 7.1). Fatty acids are organic substances whose molecules are long chains of Carbon atoms (containing from 4 to 24 atoms), combined with Hydrogen atoms and with a carboxyl group (–COOH) attached to this chain. It is the carboxyl group that provides their acidic properties.


Fatty acids are saturated (without


double bonds


between carbon atoms) and unsaturated (with double bonds between carbon atoms) (Fig. 7.2). The presence of


a


double


bond prevents the molecule from taking a linear shape. This affects the properties of the substance, for example, its melting point. Oils are liquid at room
temperature precisely because of


the presence of such acids


in their molecules.


Triglycerides and phospholipids The alcohol glycerol has three OH groups, which can interact with


acids . Therefore, three


fatty acid molecules can join it (such compounds are called triglycerides). But in many cases


,


only two fatty acid molecules join the glycerol molecule. And the third OH group interacts with the orthophosphoric acid molecule (such compounds are called phospholipids ¬
) (Fig. 7.3).

of phospholipids determine the difference in their properties. Triglycerides interact poorly with water (have hydrophobic properties). But the orthophosphoric acid residue in phospholipid molecules interacts well with water (has hydrophilic properties). Therefore, phospholipid molecules have two properties. On the one hand, their molecules are hydrophilic, and on the other hand, they are hydrophobic. It is this feature that made phospholipids the basis of cell membranes.


Fig. 7.3. Structure of triglyceride and phospholipid molecules


Waxes and steroids Glycerol is


absent in waxes and steroids. Waxes are compounds of fatty acids with other alcohols that have long molecules and only one OH group. Therefore, each wax molecule contains only one molecule of fatty acid and one molecule of alcohol.


Steroids do not contain either fatty acids


or alcohols. They are polymers of the hydrocarbon isoprene (C 5 H 8 ). Their skeleton of carbon atoms
forms several ring structures
combined into one whole (Fig. 7.4). Fig. 7.4. Model of a steroid molecule

Fig. 7.5. Lipids in living organisms


Biological role of lipids The main functions of lipids in living organisms are structural,


protective, regulatory, reserve, plastic and energy (Fig. 7.5). The structural function is performed by triglycerides, which form the basis of cell membranes.


Protective and reserve functions are performed by those structures of organisms


that accumulate fats and oils. Hormones of lipid origin in the
animal body perform a regulatory function.


The plastic function is performed by lipids, which, together with proteins, participate


in the formation of complex organic substances - lipoproteins. An important role in the metabolism of animals is played by vitamins belonging to the lipid group. For example, vitamins A, D, E. The energy function is performed by most lipids. During the oxidation of lipids weighing 1 g in a cell, 9 kcal (37.68 kJ) of energy is formed, which is then used by the cell.


Examples of the use of lipids by living organismsLipids make up the bulk of such structures of living organisms


as, for example, adipose tissue in animals. Animals such as whales have well-developed adipose tissue. In large whales, the layer of subcutaneous adipose tissue can reach 50 cm in thickness. Such a layer retains heat well, because adipose tissue is a good heat insulator.


In addition to preserving heat, adipose tissue protects the internal organs


of animals from damage due to impacts. Lipids are also a good means of storing resources (energy, organic substances, water) in case these resources are not enough. Lipids release a lot of energy during oxidation, and they are also a material for the synthesis of other substances necessary for the body. In addition, they are a source of so

Fig. 7.6. The main place of lipid storage in the body of camels is the humps


Fig. 7.7. Lipids in the endosperm of coconut seeds are initially liquid (coconut milk), and then become solid


due to the so-called metabolic water, which is formed during their oxidation. During the oxidation of 100 g of lipids, 107 g of water is formed. This is why camels (Fig. 7.6), which live in deserts, store lipids in their bodies.


Plants also often accumulate lipids. They are abundant in the seeds


of plants such as sunflower, mustard, rapeseed, cocoa, coconut, etc. (Fig. 7.7). They are nutrients that ensure good development of the plant embryo.


Lipids are a large group of hydrophobic organic substances, which include triglycerides, waxes, steroids and other compounds. They are important components of metabolism (vitamin A) and the basis of cell membranes (triglycerides). The regulatory function performed by steroid hormones (testosterone, estrogen) is extremely important. P. Topic 1


8Nucleic acids. ATP


From the biology course of plants and animals, remember where


in their cells hereditary information is stored? What substances are responsible for the storage and reproduction of hereditary information? Are these substances the same in plants and animals?


Nucleic acids and nucleotides Nucleic acid molecules are large organic molecules


- biopolymers, the monomers of which are nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three components - a nitrogenous base, a monosaccharide (ribose or deoxyribose) and an orthophosphate acid residue (Fig. 8.1). There are five different nitrogenous bases in nucleic acids (Fig. 8.2). Depending on which nitrogenous ¬
base is part of the nucleotide, there are five types of nucleotides: thymidylic (base - thymine), cytidylic (base - cytosine), uridylic (base - uracil), adenylic (base - adenine), guanylic (base - guanine).


In the cells of living organisms, individual nucleotides as separate substances


are also actively used in various metabolic processes.


During the formation of nucleic acid molecules,


a strong covalent bond is formed between the orthophosphate acid residue of one nucleotide and the monosaccharide of another. Therefore, nucleic acids,

formed in this way have the form of a chain in which the nucleotides are arranged sequentially one after another. Their number in one molecule of biopolymer can reach several million.


DNA and RNA In living organisms, there are two types of nucleic


acids


-


RNA (ribonucleic acid) and DNA (


deoxyribonucleic


acid). They differ from each other in composition and structural features.


DNA nucleotides consist of the monosaccharide


deoxyribose


and
four


nitrogenous bases—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. DNA molecules themselves usually consist of two chains of nucleotides, which are connected to each other by hydrogen bonds (Fig. 8.3).


RNA ¬
nucleotides


contain


ribose instead of deoxyribose, and uracil instead of thymine. An RNA molecule usually consists of one chain of nucleotides, different fragments of which form hydrogen bonds with each other.


Three such bonds are formed between guanine and cytosine, and


two between adenine and thymine or adenine and uracil.


Nucleic acids as carriers of hereditary information The main function of nucleic acids is to work with hereditary


information. They store and reproduce it. The structure of DNA contributes to the preservation and reproduction of information.


The DNA molecule consists of two chains of nucleotides, which


are


connected by the principle of complementarity (complementation). Opposite each nucleotide of one chain is the nucleotide that corresponds to it. Opposite adenyl is thymidyl, and opposite cytidylic is guanyl (Fig. 8.4). Therefore, in DNA molecules, the number of adenyl nucleotides is always equal to the number of thymidyl nucleotides, and the number of guanyl is equal to the number of cytidylic.


GC


RNA can also store hereditary information


.


But ¬
it does not do this as reliably as DNA, so only some viruses use this method of storage.


33. Topic 1


ATP and its role in the vital activity of cells Not only RNA


and DNA, but also individual nucleotides take an active part in the vital activity of cells. Especially important for the vital activity of cells are compounds of nucleotides with orthophosphate acid residues. From one to three such residues can be attached to a nucleotide. Accordingly, they are named according to the number of these residues. For example: ATP - adenosine triorthophosphate (adenosine triorthophosphate acid), GTP - guanosine triorthophosphate, ADP - adenosine diorthophosphate, AMP - adenosine monoorthophosphate. All nucleotides that are part of nucleic acids are monoorthophosphates. Tri- and diorthophosphates also play an important role in the biochemical processes of cells.


The most common in the cells of living organisms is ATP. It


participates in the processes of growth, movement and reproduction of cells. A large number of ATP molecules are formed in the processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis. This molecule plays the role of a universal source of energy for biochemical reactions.


Energy conversion and synthesis reactions in biological


systems


The significant role of ATP in metabolism is that it


provides energy to the vast majority of processes that occur in cells. First of all, these are the processes of synthesis of organic substances. They are carried out with the help of enzymes.


In order for enzymes to carry out a biochemical reaction, they


in most cases need energy.


ATP molecules, during interaction with enzymes, break down


into two molecules - orthophosphoric acid and ADP. In this case, energy is released:


ATP + H 2 O → ADP + H 3 PO 4 + 50 kJ/mol


This energy is used by enzymes to work. And why


ATP? Because the bond of orthophosphoric acid residues in this molecule is not ordinary, but macroergic (rich in energy) (Fig. 8.5). A lot of energy is required to form this bond, but during its destruction, energy is released in large quantities.


When molecules of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids in cells are broken down


, energy is released. The cell stores this energy. To do this, one or two orthophosphoric acid residues are added to nucleotides of monoorthophosphates (for example, AMP) and a molecule of di- or triorthophosphates (respectively, ADP or ATP) is formed.

Macroergic bondsRibose


Fig. 8.5. Macroergic bonds in the ATP molecule


The bonds formed are macroergic. Thus, ADP contains one macroergic bond, and ATP has two. During the synthesis of new organic compounds, macroergic bonds are destroyed and provide the corresponding processes with energy.


All cellular life forms on our planet have both RNA and DNA in their cells. But viruses have only one type of nucleic acid. Their virions contain either RNA or DNA under a protein coat. Only when the virus enters a host cell does it usually begin to synthesize both DNA and RNA.


Nucleic acids are biopolymers; in living organisms they are found in the form of DNA and RNA. Their monomers are nucleotides. DNA usually has the form of a double helix, consisting of two chains. RNA most often has the form of a single chain. The main function of nucleic acids is to store and reproduce genetic information. Nucleotides also participate in many biochemical processes in the cell, and ATP plays the role of a universal source of energy for biochemical reactions. P.
