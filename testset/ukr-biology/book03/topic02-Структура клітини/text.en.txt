When you studied the biology of plants and animals, you


became familiar with the methods that scientists use to study these organisms. Recall these methods. Find out if there are differences in the methods of studying plants and animals. Name the sciences that study plants and animals. From the chemistry course of grade 8, remember what isotopes are.


Discovery and first studies of cells The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke, an English physicist who worked


at Oxford University. He improved the design of the microscope and used it to study various objects, in particular the bark of the cork oak. Examining the cork with a microscope, Hooke saw cells (these were cell walls), which reminded him of monastic cells, and called them the English word cell ("chamber",


"cell", "cell"). He described his research in an article in 1665. Later, Hooke observed and described the cells of plants such as elderberry, dill, carrots, etc.


The next stage in the formation


of cytology ¬as a science is associated with the Dutchman
Antoni van Leeuwenhoek


Robert Hooke (1635–1703)


(1632–1723)


Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (Fig. 9.1), who worked in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. He discovered unicellular organisms (he was the first to see the simplest ones), erythrocytes, spermatozoa, and other cells. Fig. 9.1. The first researchers of cells

Cytology is the science of cells. Methods of studying cells


Cell theory and the emergence


of cytology


During the 18th century, significant


advances


in


the science of studying cells did not occur due to the imperfect design of microscopes


. But in the 19th century, these devices were significantly modernized and, in addition, methods for staining cells were invented. This led to a whole series of discoveries.


In 1827, Karl Behr discovered the mammalian


cell


. In 1831, Robert Brown described the nuclei of plant cells. During the same period, Matthias Schleiden proved that all plants consist of cells. Finally, in 1839, Theodor Schwann (Fig. 9.2), comparing plant and animal cells and relying on Schleiden's conclusions, formulated the cell theory. The


main provisions of this cell theory were as follows: — All organisms consist of cells or


are formed from them in various ways.


— A cell is the smallest unit of a living thing, and the whole organism


is a collection of cells.


— The growth and development of plants and animals are associated with the formation of cells. In 1859, Rudolf Virchow proved that cells arise only


from precursor cells. All this led to the emergence at the end of the 19th century of a separate science of cells — cytology.


In the 20th century, the development of cytology continued. This was facilitated by the emergence of


new research methods — first electron microscopy, and then centrifugation and methods of molecular biology.


Methods of studying cells Methods of studying cells are the same as for other biological


systems. Due to the small size of the cells themselves, only some features of their application differ.


The main methods of modern cytology: — microscopy; — cell staining; — microtoming: — centrifugation; — the method of labeled atoms.

. Topic 2


The method of microscopy consists in the fact


that


cells or their components are examined in an enlarged form using special devices — microscopes. There are two main types of microscopy — optical and electron (Fig. 9.3). In optical microscopy, light rays are used to examine cell structures, and in electron ¬
microscopy, electron beams are used.


There are several types of optical microscopes


(phase-contrast, luminescent, etc.) and two types of electron microscopes (transmission and scanning).


When using the method of


Electron microscope


Fig. 9.3.


Staining microscopes cells are treated with certain
substances - dyes. These substances react only with certain cell structures and stain them. Therefore, these structures are much easier to see and study.


The microtome method consists


in making very thin sections through the cells and then studying them using a microscope.


During centrifugation, cells are first destroyed


by the microtome


, and then placed in test tubes with a special solution and spun in centrifuges (Fig. 9.4). Under the action of centrifugal force, the cell components are concentrated in different places in the test tube. After that, they can be studied separately from each other.


The labeled atom method involves


the


introduction of radioactive isotopes of certain atoms into living cells
. The movement of these atoms in the cell can be observed using special devices. In this way, the course of biochemical reactions is monitored. Fig. 9.4. Devices for studying cells

Cells of living organisms were discovered in the 17th century. In the 19th century, Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann formulated the cell theory. A separate science, cytology, deals with the study of cells. The main methods of studying cells are microscopy (optical and electronic), cell staining, microtoming, centrifugation, and the labeled atom method. P. Topic 2


Cell structure. Cell membranes


10


Repeat the material from the previous topic and explain


what organic substances form the basis of biological membranes. Recall what properties are inherent in lipids. What lipids are most abundant in cell membranes?


Cell membranes Cell membranes are structures that surround the cell and


form a number of organelles inside it. These are the so-called membrane organelles - the nucleus, mitochondria, vacuoles, etc. Membranes are formed by two layers of lipids, in which protein molecules are located. Proteins and membrane lipids can often attach carbohydrate molecules to themselves, forming glycoproteins and glycolipids (Fig. 10.1). Due to the liquid- ¬
like nature of the lipids that form the membrane, proteins immersed in the lipid layer are quite mobile. Therefore, the model that describes the structure of the membrane is called the liquid-mosaic model.


Functions of membranes The most important functions of biological membranes are barrier,


receptor and transport. Membranes are barriers with selective permeability that regulate the exchange of substances between the cell and the environment, as well as between individual components inside the cell
. The barrier functions of membranes are performed primarily by lipids.
They form the basis of the biological membrane.


The receptor function is performed by


the


membrane complex. First of all, these are glycoproteins, which form structures located on the surface of the membrane.


Membranes play an important


role


in the metabolism between the cell and the environment and ensure intercellular interactions. They transmit signals from the external environment to the inside of the cells. Fig. 10.1. Structure of the cell membrane


44. Cell structure. Cell membranes


Membranes also perform structural, protective and enzymatic


functions. They give cells a certain shape, protect
them from damage and unite individual cells of tissues into a single whole. Enzymes located on the surface of the membranes ensure the performance of the enzymatic function. For example, during digestion in the human intestine.


Transport of substances through membranes The transport function of membranes is extremely important for the vital


activity of the cell. Proteins are of the greatest importance for its implementation. They can form through channels in the membrane or transport some substances in a bound form, forming temporary compounds with them.


The transport of substances through the membrane can occur either


without energy expenditure by cells (passive transport) or with expenditure (active transport). Passive transport is carried out from an area with a high concentration of a substance to an area with its low concentration. And active transport, on the contrary, is from an area with a low concentration to an area with a high concentration.


Both large and small molecules


of substances are transported through the membrane. The movement of small molecules occurs through simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport, and large ones - through ecto- and endocytosis.


Passive transport Only passive transport of substances (oxygen, carbon dioxide) is carried out by simple diffusion


. And both passive and active transport can be carried out by facilitated diffusion. Facilitated diffusion can be carried out through special channels located

45. Topic 2


inside large protein molecules. It can also be carried out by special transport proteins. This is how small organic molecules (glucose, some amino acids, etc.) are transported.


The transport of water molecules


through membranes is extremely important for cells. Its feature is that ¬
only water molecules need to be transported through the membrane, preventing the transfer of substances dissolved in it. This process is carried out by special membrane proteins aquaporins (Fig. 10.2).


Active transport Active transport through the cell membrane is carried out with the


help of special protein complexes or in the form of exo- or
endocytosis. This is how ions and large molecules for which
the membrane is impermeable are transported.


Membrane transport into the cell is called endocytosis.


Membrane transport from the cell is exocytosis (Fig. 10.3). The transport ¬
of solid particles is phagocytosis, and the transport of liquid substances and droplets is pinocytosis.


An example of active transport of substances through the cell membrane


is the work of the sodium-potassium pump. For normal functioning, the cell must maintain a certain ratio of Na + and K + ions in its cytoplasm and the extracellular environment.


The transfer of Na + and K + ions is carried out by a protein located


in the cell membrane. This protein pumps Na + ions out of the cell and K + ions into the cell. The transfer of these ions occurs from an area with a low concentration of ions to an area with a high concentration (there are more K + ions inside the cell, and Na + ions outside the cell). To carry out this process, the energy of ATP molecules is used.


In one cycle of operation, the pump pumps out 3Na + from the cell and pumps in


2K + (Fig. 10.4). Therefore, an excess of positive ions accumulates on the outer side of the membrane.

. This creates a potential difference between the outer and inner sides of the membrane. This difference is used as an energy source by many other protein complexes to transport various substances through the membrane.


Cell membranes are structures that surround the cell and form a number of organelles inside it. They are composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Lipids form a double layer. In each layer, the hydrophilic parts of lipid molecules are oriented outward, and the hydrophobic ones are oriented inward. Protein complexes in the membrane can penetrate it completely. They can also be located within one lipid layer or even outside the membrane. The composition of the outer and inner lipid layers can differ. The main functions of membranes are barrier, transport, and receptor. P. Topic 2


Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and non-membrane organelles


11


Review the materials of the 6th grade biology course. What


cell organelles did you learn about then? Think about the features of the structure of cells that are characteristic of prokaryotes (for example, bacteria) and eukaryotes (for example, plants). What organelles are the same in prokaryotes and eukaryotes?


Cytoplasm and organellesCytoplasm is the main content of cells. It consists of


cytosol, cytoskeleton, organelles and inclusions.


Cytosol is a semi-liquid substance, the density of which can


vary within quite wide limits. It provides the interconnection of all components of the cell. In addition, important biochemical reactions take place in it.


Organelles are structures in the cells of living organisms


that have a characteristic structure and perform certain functions. Most of them exist in cells constantly, and some organelles can disappear for a certain time and then form again. Organelles are divided into two large groups - membranous and non-membranous (Fig. 11.1). Membranous organelles are separated from other parts of the cell by plasma membranes that cover them.

Cytoskeleton


This is a system of microfilaments and microtubules formed by special proteins. A significant part of the cytoskeleton is formed by microtubules from the protein tubulin and microfilaments from the protein actin


Microtubules


Microfilaments and microtubules form the cell's skeleton and ensure
its shape is maintained.
The cytoskeleton ¬
is used to transport substances and move organelles inside the cell

Small subunit


Ribosomes


Ribosomes


Have a complex shape and consist of two parts (subunits) - large and small. These subunits can disintegrate and reunite. The subunits include RNA molecules and proteins. In the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, there are ribosomes of the eukaryotic type, and in the mitochondria, plastids and cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells, there are ribosomes of the prokaryotic type. These types of ribosomes differ in some RNA and proteins that are part of their composition

its rotation

Plasma membrane


Flagella and cilia


of eukaryotic cells


Cell surface


Present in the cells of ¬
eukaryotic organisms. They are hollow tubules, along the inner surface of which there are nine pairs of microtubules. And two more microtubules are in the middle part. They are covered on the outside with a cytoplasmic membrane


Intracellular movements There is always an exchange of substances


that are formed there between different parts of the cell, and cell organelles often need to be moved to other parts of the cell. For example, so that chloroplasts are better illuminated by the sun's rays. This is provided by two mechanisms of intracellular movements. The first is carried out due to changes in the density of the cytosol and the flow of a more liquid substance to the desired place. The second occurs by dragging organelles or vesicles with the necessary substances along microtubules with special proteins.


Cilia and flagella. Ensuring cell movement Flagella and cilia of eukaryotic cells have a much more complex


structure than flagella of bacteria. The movement of cilia and flagella is ensured due to the interaction of their internal structures. Cilia and flagella can have different patterns of movement (Fig. 11.2). The trajectory of movement of these structures in different organisms may be, for example, ¬


rod ¬-shaped,


hook-shaped,
funnel-shaped or wave-shaped. During movement, their length does not change, and the movement itself is ensured by their bending (similar to the beating of a whip).


Flagellum
Cilia


Fig. 11.2. Movement of cilia and flagella


Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four types of RNA and about a hundred proteins. Prokaryotic ribosomes contain three types of RNA and a smaller number of proteins than in eukaryotic ribosomes.


Flagella or cilia are organelles that occur in most eukaryotic cells. However, there are eukaryotes for which such organelles are not characteristic. Thus, red algae, which are one of the largest and most ancient groups of algae, do not have flagella or cilia at any stage of their life cycle.


The number of flagella in different types of bacteria can be different. Thus, Vibrio cholerae has only one flagellum, while in Escherichia coli they are located throughout the surface of the cell.


The cytoplasm is the basis of all cells. Its components are cytosol, organelles and cellular inclusions. Cytosol is a semi-liquid substance that fills the cell and can change its viscosity. Membrane and non-membrane organelles are located in the cytosol. Non-membrane organelles are the cytoskeleton, ribosomes, cilia and flagella. They ensure protein synthesis, the movement of structures inside the cell, as well as the cells themselves. P. Topic 2


Membrane organelles


12


Plants are able to form organic substances


from inorganic ones through the process of photosynthesis. In which organelles of plant cells does this process occur? What types of these organelles did you learn about while studying plant biology?


Variety of membrane organelles As you already know, cell organelles are divided into two large groups


- membrane and non-membrane. Membrane organelles are separated from other parts of the cell by a membrane that covers them. This membrane can usually be single or double. According to this characteristic, organelles are divided into single-membrane and double-membrane.


Double-membrane organelles are nuclei, mitochondria and plastids.


Single-membrane organelles include the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus (complex), vacuoles, lysosomes and microbodies (peroxisomes).


All these organelles are present only in eukaryotic cells.


Prokaryotic organisms do not have membrane organelles.


The presence of membrane organelles allows you to divide the internal space


of the cell into separate volumes - compartments. Inside each
of these compartments, the cell can create certain conditions (lower or higher pH, lower or higher concentration of certain ions, etc.). Due to this, reactions can occur in different organelles that would interfere with each other if they occurred in the same volume.


The membranes of organelles can also form folded structures


. This increases their area and allows a large number of enzyme systems to be placed in a certain order, which facilitates the course of biochemical processes.


Double-membrane organellesDouble-membrane organelles (nuclei, mitochondria, and plastids) have two


membranes - an outer and an inner. The inner membrane can form folds. These organelles contain DNA molecules.


New mitochondria and plastids are formed only by the division of


old mitochondria or plastids. The cell can form the nucleus and all single-membrane organelles in its cytoplasm independently.

Nucleus


Responsible for the preservation, reproduction and implementation of hereditary information. Controls all processes in the cell. The nucleolus is the site of ribosome formation


The shape of the nucleus is most often spherical or elliptical, but irregularly shaped nuclei are also found. The nuclear envelope is pierced by pores in many places. A large number of such pores in the membrane allows for easy exchange of information between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Karyoplasm, chromatin and nucleolus are located in the middle ¬of
the nucleus
. Karyoplasm is a semi-transparent internal environment in which all biochemical reactions occur. During cell division, rod-shaped structures — chromosomes — are formed from chromatin.


Cristae


Outer membrane


Produce energy as a result of biological oxidation processes.


Inner membrane


Mitochondria


The inner membrane of mitochondria forms outgrowths — cristae. This structure of the membrane allows it to accommodate many protein complexes that carry out biological oxidation processes. The outer membrane is smooth. The internal environment of mitochondria is called the matrix. They contain prokaryotic-type ribosomes. The matrix
contains circular molecules of
mitochondrial DNA .


Thylakoids


Outer membrane


Inner membrane


Plastids


Carry out the process of photosynthesis. They synthesize a number of proteins necessary for this process. They can provide coloration of plant organs and accumulate reserve substances.


The inner membrane can form structures separated from it in the form of flattened sacs — thylakoids. This structure of the membrane allows for the placement of many protein complexes that carry out the processes of photosynthesis. The outer membrane is smooth. The internal
environment of the plastids is called
the stroma. They contain prokaryotic ribosomes. The stroma contains circular DNA molecules. Green (chloroplasts), yellow-orange or red (chromoplasts) and discolored (leucoplasts) are distinguished by their color.


53. Topic 2


Single-membrane organelles Single-membrane organelles include the endoplasmic reticulum,


the Golgi complex (apparatus), the vacuole and the lysosome. They are covered with a single membrane that separates their contents from the cellular environment.

13 Cell diversity


While studying the biology course, you have already become familiar with the two


main types of cells of living organisms. Explain
what features are inherent in these types of cells, using the example of single-celled living organisms.


Types of cell organization All living organisms that have a cellular structure can be divided


into prokaryotic (prokaryotes) and eukaryotic (eukaryotes). Prokaryotes include bacteria, and eukaryotes include plants, animals and fungi. Their cells have a different organization. Accordingly, two types of cell organization are distinguished: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.


A characteristic feature that distinguishes prokaryotic cells


from eukaryotic cells is the absence of a nucleus in their cells. In addition, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ in the presence or absence of certain organelles in their structure. And this, in turn, determines the features of their functioning and reproduction.


Prokaryotic cellsProkaryotic cells consist of a surface apparatus and


cytoplasm (Fig. 13.1). The surface apparatus usually includes a plasma membrane and a cell wall containing the substance murein. However, in some prokaryotic organisms,


the


cell


wall may be absent. As additional elements to the surface apparatus in prokaryotes, bacterial


flagella


, mucous capsules, and various outgrowths of the plasma membrane may be included.


The cytoplasm of prokaryotes is represented by a semi-


liquid


cytosol, in which ribosomes are located, and a nucleoid (a circular DNA molecule). Membrane organelles are absent in the cytoplasm, but the plasma membrane Fig. 13.1. Structure of a prokaryotic cell


56. Diversity of cells


The cell membrane can form indentations that perform various functions. For example, in cyanobacterial cells, the membrane forms indentations such as thylakoids. They play a leading role in the processes of photosynthesis carried out by the cell. The cytoskeleton is not as
developed as in eukaryotes. The average size of prokaryotic cells is
from 0.1 to 10 microns.


Eukaryotic cells Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotic organisms have a complex


cell structure (Fig. 13.2). Their surface apparatus, in addition to the plasma membrane (plasmalemma), contains supramembrane and submembrane complexes. The submembrane complex is formed by elements of the cytoskeleton.


Some groups of eukaryotes (plants, fungi) have cell walls.


Eukaryotic organisms also have surface structures that ensure cell movement - flagella and cilia, which have a complex internal structure and are not the result of the development of prokaryotic flagella. In addition, some eukaryotic cells can perform amoeboid movement.


The internal component of the eukaryotic cell contains structures that are


absent in prokaryotic organisms. These are single-membrane and double- ¬membrane
organelles. The cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells has a more complex ¬structure
.


The complex internal structure of the cell, the presence of the cytoskeleton,


nucleus and membrane organelles allow eukaryotic cells to reach much larger sizes. The average size of eukaryotic cells is about 50 microns. In addition, they have acquired the ability to form stable cell complexes, different cells of which can perform different functions. This led to the emergence of true


multicellularity


and the appearance of large organisms - animals, plants and fungi.


Diversity


of


eukaryotic cells Eukaryotic cells have a very diverse structure. Their


features


can


be considered


on


the


example


of animal, plant
and fungal cells. Adaptations to the lifestyle and method of nutrition of these organisms significantly affect the structure of their cells. Thus, plants and fungi lead a relatively sedentary lifestyle. They usually move at the stage of spores and seeds or perform growth movements (grow in the direction they need). Therefore, the presence of a cell wall does not interfere with their movements. But it provides additional protection from damage. At the same time, animals are mostly quite mobile living organisms. And the excess weight of the cell wall will only hinder them during movement. And it significantly limits movement.

58. Cell diversity


Characteristic features of plant cells The characteristics of plant cells are the presence of a cell wall and


plastids. Some groups of algae have a specific structure of plastids and some other components of the cell. But all higher land plants and green algae differ slightly in the structure of their cells.


Characteristic features of animal cells Animal cells do not have a cell wall and plastids. Vacuoles


in them are small and usually do not reach large sizes. However, specialized vacuoles can develop, for example, contractile ones. Some animal cells can easily change their shape and move using pseudopodia, like amoebas. An example of such cells is human leukocytes.


Features of fungal cells Fungal cells, like plants, have a cell wall. In most


cases, the basis of the wall is chitin. Although other polysaccharides may also occur. The endoplasmic reticulum in fungal cells is often less developed than in animals.


There are two main types of cells of living organisms
- prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells do not contain a nucleus and membrane organelles. ¬
Eukaryotic cells are distinguished by a great diversity of their structure. Fungal and plant cells have a cell wall, but animal cells do not. At the same time, plastids are absent in fungal and animal cells, but are present in plant cells. P. Generalizing tasks on the topic “Cell structure”
