Principles of cell functioning


Metabolism and energy

Repeat the definition of a system that you studied


earlier. Recall why living organisms can be considered systems. Repeat what you learned about the metabolism of substances in the human body.


Metabolism. Types of metabolismA cell is a single whole, a biological system, the elements of which


are united by a common metabolism and energy conversion. Metabolism is a set of chemical reactions that occur in cells and are necessary to maintain life. Cell metabolism can be conditionally divided into two stages - exchange with the environment and internal metabolism, or metabolism (Fig. 14.1). During exchange with the environment, plants, for example, absorb water, carbon dioxide, minerals, etc., and release oxygen, water, and other substances.


Metabolism can be defined as a regular order of transformation


of substances and energy in the cell, aimed at its growth, vital activity, and self-reproduction. The metabolism of any cell consists of two types of exchange or interconnected complexes of reactions. These are reactions of plastic (anabolism) and energy (catabolism) exchange.

Splitting of complex organic compounds into simpler ones


What happens ¬
Due


to the energy of macroergic bonds, the synthesis of complex organic compounds from simpler precursors occurs


What energy transformations occur


ADP + F + Energy → ATP The energy produced during the oxidation of organic substances is used to form an ATP molecule from ADP and orthophosphoric acid molecules


ATP → ADP + F + Energy ATP molecules, which contain macroergic bonds, break down into ADP and orthophosphoric acid (F) molecules. In this case,
energy is released, which is used
to synthesize organic compounds


Result


Formation of organic molecules necessary for the life of the cell


The energy that is released is stored by the cell in the form of macroergic bonds of a number of compounds (for example, ATP)


Main stages of energy metabolism The breakdown of organic substances during energy metabolism


occurs in several stages. It can begin even outside ¬
the body, as, for example, in spiders, which are characterized by external digestion. But the main processes of catabolism occur in cells.

Glycolysis and its significance Glycolysis is a biochemical process that


C 6 H 12 O 6 Glucose


2 ATP2 ADP


usually occurs in all cells of the body and is one of the sources of ATP supply for the cell. In addition, during glycolysis, compounds are formed that are used
in the following processes of cellular respiration.


The process of glycolysis includes 10 biochemical reactions


. As a result of these reactions


, two molecules of pyruvate (


pyruvic


acid ) are formed


. In addition, during glycolysis, two molecules of ATP are consumed and four molecules of ATP are synthesized. Accordingly, from each glucose


molecule


, the cell receives two molecules of pyruvate and two molecules of ATP (Fig. 14.2).


Glycolysis is not such an energetically advantageous process: two molecules


of ATP are not very much. However, this process is simple, reliable and very fast! It arose in the early stages of life and is now one of the main metabolic processes of all living organisms.


The great advantage of glycolysis is that it does not require oxygen.


That is why human muscles can work even in conditions of lack of oxygen during heavy physical exertion. They receive the necessary energy thanks to the process of glycolysis.


FermentationFermentation is the process of oxidation of carbohydrates, which occurs


without the participation of oxygen and allows cells to obtain energy in the form of ATP molecules. The first stage of fermentation is glycolysis. And in the next

Fig. 14.3. Types of fermentation


64. Metabolism of substances and energy


At this stage, depending on the type of fermentation, alcohol, lactic and citric acid or other compounds are formed from the product of glycolysis (pyruvate).


Depending on the substances formed, several


types of fermentation are distinguished (Fig. 14.3). Alcoholic fermentation is characterized by the formation of molecules of ethyl alcohol, water and carbon dioxide. During lactic acid fermentation, the product of the process is lactic acid
, and during acetic acid fermentation, acetic acid.


The significance of fermentation processes Fermentation is an extremely important process both for natural


processes and for humans. In living nature, fermentation provides energy to those organisms that live in oxygen-free conditions. And these are not only microbes: this problem is also relevant for many parasites. And the release of carbon dioxide and methane as a result of fermentation processes by some organisms can have consequences for the entire planet. They are greenhouse gases, and an increase in their concentration in the atmosphere can lead to global warming on the planet.


Man uses fermentation to obtain many food


products: bread, kefir, fermented baked milk, yogurt, etc. Fermentation also occurs in the human body. During heavy loads, fermentation produces lactic acid, which leads to muscle pain after exercise.


Metabolism is a characteristic feature of all living organisms. Metabolism within organisms is called metabolism. There are two main types of metabolism: energy (catabolism) and plastic (anabolism). During catabolism, complex organic compounds are broken down into simple ones. The energy released is stored in the form of ATP. During anabolism, complex organic compounds are synthesized from simple organic substances with the expenditure of ATP. Important components of catabolism are the processes of glycolysis and fermentation. P. Topic 3


The second stage of cellular respiration


15


Repeat the structural features of mitochondria that you


studied in the previous topic. Which organisms have mitochondria in their cells? Why are they needed? Remember from your chemistry course what oxidation is. Using the material from the previous paragraph, explain the difference between pulmonary and cellular respiration.


What is cellular respiration? Cellular respiration is a set of reactions of oxidation of organic


substances by oxygen that occur in the cells of living organisms. It should be noted that cellular respiration and pulmonary respiration are not the same thing. Pulmonary respiration is a physiological process, as a result of which certain gases enter from the air into the blood or from the blood into the air. And cellular respiration is a biochemical process, a set of chemical reactions in cells.


Cellular respiration consists of two stages. The first of them


(glycolysis) occurs in the cytosol, and the second (oxygen) - in the mitochondria ¬
.


In plants, during cellular respiration, organic


substances synthesized by the plant itself are oxidized, in animals and fungi -
substances that the body receives as a result of nutrition or those that they
synthesize themselves.


Biochemical processes of cellular respiration The general formula of biological oxidation is as follows:


C 6 H 12 O 6 +6 O 2→6 CO 2+6 H 2 O+ Energy


Glucose Oxygen Carbon Dioxide


Water


gas


As a result of the first stage of this process (glycolysis), which


occurs in the cytosol, pyruvate (pyruvic acid) is formed. It is transported from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix, where, with the help of enzymes, it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Oxidation occurs in several stages, each of which releases energy. Part of the energy is released in the form of heat (45%), and 55% is stored in ATP.

Efficiency of cellular respiration The key stage of cellular respiration is the Krebs cycle (three


carboxylic acid cycle). It is in the reactions of this cycle that compounds are formed that are a source of protons and electrons for the oxidation process. Cellular respiration is an extremely efficient process. Even during the first stage of cellular respiration — glycolysis — the cell receives two molecules of ATP from one molecule of glucose, and at the following stages
of cellular respiration, 36 more molecules are added to these molecules
(Fig. 15.1).


Cellular respiration is a biochemical process that occurs in mitochondria. During this process, organic substances formed during glycolysis are oxidized by oxygen that enters the cell from the environment. Part of the energy released in this process is stored by cells in the form of ATP molecules. Topic 3


Photosynthesis. The importance of photosynthesis and respiration


16


Repeat the features of the structure of plastids that you


studied in the previous topic. Which organisms have plastids in their cells? Why are they needed? Recall the structure of a chloroplast. How many membranes are in its composition? What structures does the inner membrane of a chloroplast form?


Where does photosynthesis occur? Photosynthesis is the process of formation by living organisms of organic


substances from inorganic substances using light energy. Photosynthesis is carried out by both unicellular living organisms (cyanobacteria and algae) and multicellular (algae and land plants). Photosynthesis can occur in all parts of the body that contain
chloroplasts.


In plant cells, the process of photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts

bacteria evolved into chloroplasts when they formed a symbiosis with eukaryotic cells and began to live inside them. In addition to chloroplasts, there are also other types of plastids - chromoplasts and leucoplasts. But photosynthesis does not occur in them.


As a result of photosynthesis, carbohydrates (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) are formed from carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O)


using solar energy:


6CO 2 + 6H 2 O +


Light energy = C 6 H 12 O 6 +6O 2

This process consists of two main phases - light and dark


(Fig. 16.1).


Processes of the light phase of photosynthesis During the light phase, light quanta are first captured by


the pigment chlorophyll, which is located on the thylakoid membranes. The energy of the quanta is transferred to electrons, which are captured by
carrier molecules. The energy of these electrons is used
in the thylakoids to synthesize ATP. The lost electrons are replaced by electrons that are formed as a result of the splitting (photolysis) of water under the influence of light. The overall equation for water photolysis can be represented as follows:


2Н 2 О = 4Н + + О 2 + 4 e – ,


where e – is an electron. Oxygen is released as a by-product of the reaction, and protons H +


are picked up by NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) carrier molecules. By attaching protons to themselves, they become energy accumulators (NADP H 2 ) and are used in the dark phase for the synthesis of carbohydrates.


Thus, the result of the light phase of photosynthesis is the formation


of oxygen, the synthesis of ATP, and the reduction of NADP.


Processes of the dark phase of photosynthesis The dark phase of photosynthesis occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts.


The set of reactions involved in this process is called the Calvin cycle. In them, with the participation of carbon dioxide coming from the outside and the products of the light phase of photosynthesis NADP H 2 and ATP, glucose molecules are formed.


This phase is called dark not because it occurs in the dark


. In most plants, it occurs during the day. This name
only means that light does not directly participate in it.


69. Topic 3


Biological significance and planetary role of photosynthesis The process of photosynthesis is the main way of forming organic


substances on our planet. In a year, photosynthetic organisms form more than 150 billion tons of organic substances. Photosynthesis also provides oxygen to the atmosphere (up to 200 billion tons annually), which living organisms use in the processes of respiration.


The result of photosynthesis was the formation of a large number of


minerals.


Another result of photosynthesis is the ozone layer. It is


a thin layer of our atmosphere, formed from oxygen under the influence of solar radiation. The presence of this layer sharply reduces the amount of ultraviolet rays reaching the surface of the planet. This protects living organisms from possible negative consequences (significantly reduces the risk of damage to DNA molecules in cells).

ATP It supplies oxygen, which organisms can use to produce energy. Organisms need it


constantly:
even when the body is sleeping, many processes are taking place in it. New substances are formed and old ones are destroyed, the process of cell growth and division occurs, the heart continues to pump blood through the vessels - all this requires the expenditure of energy, which is formed as a result of the process of cellular respiration. It is thanks to cellular respiration that living organisms manage to maintain ¬a high level
of vital activity. For example,


Fig. 16.2. The relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration


it allows seals and polar


bears


to produce enough heat to survive in the harsh conditions of the Arctic.


The planetary role of respiration is extremely important. Green


plants continuously produce oxygen, and maintaining its content in the atmosphere at the required level is possible only thanks to the processes of cellular respiration (Fig. 16.2). If the balance between oxygen production and consumption is disrupted, it can lead to catastrophic consequences for the entire planet.


Both a lack and an excess of oxygen in the atmosphere will lead to mass


death of organisms. Its lack will cause suffocation, and an excess will cause oxygen poisoning of organisms.


In order to ensure the process of photosynthesis with carbon dioxide molecules (CO 2 ), plants need to open stomata on their leaves. But in a hot climate, this leads to excessive water consumption by them. Therefore, plants from the Tolstyanov and Cactaceae families accumulate this gas in their cells in the form of certain compounds at night, and use it for photosynthesis during the day. This type of photosynthesis is called CAM metabolism (translated from English - metabolism according to the type of tolstyanov).


Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts and consists of two phases - light and dark. During the light phase, light quanta are captured by the pigment chlorophyll, and their energy is used to synthesize ATP. In the dark phase of photosynthesis, CO2 molecules are fixed and glucose molecules are formed due to ATP and other products of the light phase. Living organisms produce oxygen during photosynthesis, and consume it during cellular respiration. Together, these processes provide favorable conditions for the existence of living organisms on Earth. P
. Topic 3


Chemosynthesis


17


In the course of plant biology, you studied, among other things,


legumes. Remember why growing legumes increases soil fertility. In the previous paragraph, you considered the features of photosynthesis. Where do plants get energy for the reactions of this process?


Basic principles and types of chemosynthesis


Chemosynthesis


is the process of forming organic


substances


from inorganic ones, which occurs due to the energy of chemical reactions. These are oxidation reactions that occur in the cells of microorganisms. This principle of operation distinguishes chemosynthetic organisms from photosynthetic ones, since the latter use sunlight as a source of energy, not chemical reactions.


Chemosynthetic organisms are divided into groups


according to the reactions they use. To obtain energy, microorganisms can use the reactions of oxidation of hydrogen or compounds of Nitrogen, Iron or Sulfur.


For example:


2H 2 S + O 2 → 2 H 2 O + 2 S + Energy


Sulfur bacteria


Chemosynthetic microorganisms Nitrifying bacteria (Fig. 17.1) oxidize


ammonia and its compounds to nitrites and nitrates. Usually this process is carried out by two types of bacteria. The first oxidizes ammonia to nitrites, and the second - nitrites to nitrates.


Iron bacteria oxidize Fe 2+ to


Iron bacteria


Fig. 17.1. Chemosynthetic microorganisms Fe 3+ . As a result of their activity


, iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3 is formed .
This compound is deposited by bacteria in their mucous capsule.


72. Chemosynthesis


Sulfur bacteria oxidize hydrogen sulfide to sulfur


and then to salts of sulfuric acid. Hydrogen bacteria use hydrogen, which is formed as a result of the decomposition of the remains of organisms by other bacteria. They oxidize this hydrogen, and the energy obtained is used to convert CO 2 into methane and other organic compounds.


Agglomeration of living organisms near the “black pile”


Biological


significance and planetary role


of chemosynthesis


Chemosynthetic organisms play a very


important role in the cycle of elements such as
Nitrogen, Sulfur and Ferrum. They produce organic substances where photosynthesis is impossible. Thus, deep at the bottom of the oceans there are real “oases of life” around the “black piles”. "Black pools" are underwater hot springs, the water of which is saturated with sulfur compounds. Sulfur bacteria use these compounds for their growth. And other living organisms feed on them (Fig. 17.2).


Iron


bacteria have become real creators of


fossils. Most iron ore deposits were created thanks to millions of years of activity of these microorganisms. And hydrogen bacteria live in soils and play an important role in the processes of transformation of substances that occur there.


Chemosynthesis is the process of formation of organic substances from inorganic substances, which occurs due to the energy of chemical reactions. Chemosynthetic organisms are divided into groups according to the reactions they use. To obtain energy, microorganisms can use the reactions of oxidation of hydrogen or compounds of Nitrogen, Iron or Sulfur. These microorganisms play an important role in nature.P. Topic 3


Synthetic processes in cells and ¬
organisms. Metabolic disorders


18


In the previous topic, you studied cell organelles.


Recall in which organelles the synthesis of organic substances occurs. Repeat the definition of metabolism and name the types of metabolism that are inherent in the cell. Recall what consequences a lack of vitamins in the human body can lead to. What is the difference between autotrophs and heterotrophs?


The main synthetic processes in cells Plastic metabolism is the formation of complex organic substances


from simpler ones. It is in the process of plastic metabolism that all biopolymers and cellular structures of living organisms are formed. Types of plastic metabolism are the processes of photosynthesis and chemosynthesis, since during them complex organic substances are formed from inorganic ones.


For the reactions of plastic metabolism of their cells, both heterotrophic


and autotrophic organisms use external sources of energy and carbon atoms. The difference lies in the sources from which they obtain them. Autotrophs obtain Carbon from inorganic substances (carbon dioxide) due to the energy of sunlight. And heterotrophs - from organic substances of other living organisms due to the oxidation of part of these substances.

74. Synthetic processes in cells and ¬organisms


Similarity of metabolic processes in different organismsIn the cells of plants, animals and fungi, the main biochemical processes


occur in the same way. The processes of cellular respiration, including the reactions of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, occur in the same way. In all organisms, nucleic acids and proteins are synthesized according to the same scheme. And the same enzyme complexes are involved in the processes of this synthesis. And the processes of regulation are also very similar. And although such biochemical processes are not absolutely identical, the sequence of basic reactions in all cases is the same.


Scientists believe this is a consequence of the fact that all eukaryotic cells


have a common ancestor, in the cells of which all these biochemical processes have already occurred.


Consequences of metabolic disorders Metabolic disorders can occur for various reasons. For


example, a lack of vitamins in food leads to hypovitaminosis in humans, and then diseases such as rickets, scurvy, or beriberi develop. A lack or excess of certain chemical elements can also lead to metabolic disorders in plants. Most often, this leads to a decrease in growth intensity or damage to plant leaves.


Disorders can also occur as a result of genetic changes -


mutations. You will learn more about them in the following paragraphs of the textbook.


Synthetic processes actively occur in many cell organelles. The biochemical process that unites them with each other and with the processes of energy metabolism is the Krebs cycle. The main biochemical processes in the cells of different organisms are similar to each other. And their violation leads to serious consequences. P.
