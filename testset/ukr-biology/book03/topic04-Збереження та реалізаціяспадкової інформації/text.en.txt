Preservation and implementation of hereditary information


19 Genes and genomes


When you got acquainted with the chemical composition of the cell,


you considered such a group of organic substances as nucleic acids. What structural features are inherent in these substances? What functions do they perform in cells? Also remember what genetics studies.


Hereditary information Why do children resemble their parents, and a sunflower seed


grows


into


a sunflower, not wheat? Because the body of the offspring is built on the information it receives from its parents. It is this information that determines the size and shape of the organism, the structure and functions of its cells and organs. This information also determines, for example, how wheat will defend itself against parasitic fungi and how a cat will catch a mouse while hunting. This information is called hereditary, or genetic.


Hereditary information is contained in DNA molecules


, which are in each cell of the body.


In eukaryotic cells, DNA is part of


chromosomes, which are contained in the nuclei of cells. And all tissues and organs are formed from cells (Fig. 19.1).


ChromosomeDNA


GenesAll hereditary information of the organism is divided


Fig. 19.1. Hereditary
information in the human body


into separate small blocks, which are called genes. 78. Genes


and


Genomes


Each gene is a section of a DNA molecule. It


is


responsible


for the formation of one or more traits of an organism. But most traits are formed as a result of the interaction of several genes.


RNA


molecule


In


what


structures are genes located? In karyotes


, they are concentrated in a large


circular


DNA molecule (this is the nucleoid or bacterial chromosome). In addition, they are in small circular DNA molecules - plasmids.


In eukaryotes, genes are located in the chromosomes


of


the


nucleus


, mitochondria and plastids. According to their location, eukaryotic genes are divided into nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid genes.


Fig. 19.2. Scheme of the formation of gene products and traits of an organism


How genes work
As is known, proteins consist of amino acids, and DNA - of nucleotides ¬


. In each of the proteins, amino acids are located in a certain sequence. The sequence of DNA nucleotides determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule, which determines the characteristics of each of them. The sequence of nucleotides in each gene is different. Therefore, different genes contain information about the structure of different protein molecules.


Some genes contain information not about a protein molecule, but about an


RNA molecule that performs a certain function in the cell. Protein or RNA molecules, the structure of which is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in the gene, are called gene products.


To form a gene product, enzymes


first synthesize (form) an RNA molecule corresponding to its structure in the corresponding DNA region. This molecule can then be used in various processes in the cell. Or, based on information from this RNA, a protein molecule can be synthesized, which is the product of the gene (Fig. 19.2).


Types of genes By function, genes in living organisms can be divided into two


large groups: structural and regulatory. Structural genes contain information about the structure of protein and RNA molecules of the cell that are part of organelles or the cytoplasm of cells.


Regulatory genes also contain information about the structure of


protein or RNA molecules. But their task is to regulate the work of structural genes. They can speed it up or slow it down. Or even stop the synthesis of a gene product that the cell does not need at the moment.

Fig. 19.3. Components of the human genome


Genome All genes of an organism are part of the genome. In addition to genes,


the genome of an organism includes sections of the DNA molecule that do not form products (Fig. 19.3). It is the genome that regulates all processes in the cell. This is the formation of necessary substances, the interaction of cells with each other, the reaction to external stimuli, and other processes.


The size of the genomes of living organisms is determined in two different


ways. In the first case, the number of genes is counted, and in the second, the number of nucleotide pairs in the DNA chains.

Genetic codeAs you have already learned, the structure of a protein molecule is determined by the


sequence of nucleotides in DNA. Therefore, scientists say that the structure of a protein is encoded in DNA. Each amino acid is encoded using three nucleotides. Such a triplet of nucleotides, which corresponds to a certain amino acid, is called a codon. The system of recording hereditary

of information in nucleic acid molecules, according to which a certain sequence of nucleotides in a DNA and RNA molecule determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule, is called the genetic code.


Most living organisms store hereditary information in DNA molecules. But there are exceptions. Some viruses can store hereditary information in RNA molecules, and their genes, respectively, are sections of RNA.


The information that determines the properties of an organism and is transmitted from parents to their descendants is called hereditary. Hereditary information is recorded in genes - sections of DNA, each of which performs one or more functions. Genes are divided into structural and regulatory. The entire set of genes of an organism is called the genome. The system of recording hereditary information in nucleic acid molecules is called the genetic code. P. Topic 4


Structure of genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes


20


Remember what substance is the carrier of hereditary information


in living organisms. Repeat what a gene is. What are the types of genes? What is the difference between structural and regulatory genes?


Gene structure diagram
All genes have the same structural diagram. They consist of several


sections (Fig. 20.1). The main section of any gene is the one that contains information about the structure of a protein or RNA molecule (gene product). This is the coding part of the gene. Other sections of the gene are non-coding. They do not contain information about the structure of molecules, the synthesis of which is provided by the gene. But they are responsible for the work of the gene.


The non-coding sections of the gene are the promoter and the terminator. The promoter


is the section of the gene that marks the place where RNA synthesis begins, the terminator is where synthesis ends. In addition, the gene includes regulatory regions that regulate its work.


Genes of prokaryotes Genes of prokaryotes have a relatively simple structure. Most often


, each of these genes contains information about only one structure - a protein or RNA molecule.


Genes of prokaryotic organisms are often organized into operons.


An operon is a structure consisting of several structural genes (Fig. 20.2). It allows prokaryotes to synthesize at once

Fig


. 20.3. The structure of a eukaryotic gene


is the product of several genes. Structural genes in an operon are located side by side and all have one common promoter, one common terminator, and one common operator that regulates its work.


An example of an operon is the lactose operon of Escherichia coli


. It contains genes that encode enzymes necessary for the synthesis of the carbohydrate lactose.


Genes of eukaryotes Unlike prokaryotic genes, genes of eukaryotic organisms


do not form operons. Each of them has its own promoter and terminator. In addition, the structure of these genes is more complex. Their DNA region contains nucleotide sequences that do not contain the information necessary for the synthesis of the gene product (protein or RNA molecule). Such regions are called introns. Those regions that contain the necessary information are called exons. Usually, a eukaryotic gene contains several introns and exons (Fig. 20.3).


An important part of eukaryotic genes are regulatory regions.


With the help of these sites, the cell can accelerate or slow down the synthesis of the gene product. This structure allows eukaryotic organisms to carry out very fine regulation of the work of their genes.


For the functioning of genes of living organisms, the presence of special sites for the beginning (promoter), regulation and completion (terminator) of reading information is required. Genes of prokaryotic organisms can be combined into special groups - operons, which all have one promoter, operator and terminator. Genes of eukaryotic organisms contain non-coding (introns) and coding (exons) DNA sections. In addition, these genes have regulatory sites that change the speed of their work. P. Topic 4

Repeat the concepts of gene and genome. What components


are responsible for the beginning and end of gene work? Report the differences in the structure of genes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Recall what an operon is and explain in which living organisms operons occur.


Features of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes Prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms differ from each other


not only in the structure of genes. Their genomes also have distinctive features.

Eukaryotic genomes are divided into two large parts - nuclear


and extranuclear. The nuclear part is represented by genes located in the chromosomes of the cell nucleus. The extranuclear part of the genome is represented by the DNA of mitochondria and plastids.


Main types of RNA There are several types of RNA in cells. They perform different functions


and are produced by cells in different quantities. The most common types in cells are messenger, ribosomal, transfer, and small nuclear RNAs.

Stages of realization of hereditary information Hereditary information stored in DNA is used


by the cell in the form of synthesized products (RNA molecules and proteins). The realization of this information occurs in several stages - transcription, RNA maturation and translation (Fig. 21.2).

Regulation of the implementation of hereditary information There are more than 20,000 genes in the human genome. But for vital activity


and the performance of its functions, each individual cell requires much fewer genes. Thus, the nerve cell of the optic nerve does not need to produce salivary enzymes or sex hormones. And the muscle cell has no point in synthesizing hemoglobin. Therefore, most of the genes in the cells are "turned off", inactive.


But even those genes that work do not always work equally.


If


there is a need to produce saliva, then the genes that produce the necessary enzymes work actively. And when the need passes, the intensity of


their


work


should


be


reduced


. Thus, cells can save the body's resources.


In cells, the regulation of the implementation of genetic information can occur


using


several


mechanisms (Fig. 21.3).


The first mechanism is the interaction of the products of regulatory genes (


usually proteins) with certain gene structures: an operator, promoter or regulatory regions. This allows you to change the speed of gene activity or to “turn them on” or “off”.


The second mechanism is the modification of certain nucleotides in


DNA chains. If a methyl radical (CH 3 ) is added to them, then reading information from the DNA section behind such a nucleotide becomes impossible.


The third mechanism is the packaging of certain DNA sections with the help of


proteins in such a way that hereditary information cannot be read from them.


In addition, regulation is possible at later stages, when


the cell blocks the work of RNA or proteins that are products of gene activity.


Mammalian twins, which begin to develop from cells formed after the division of one zygote, receive identical genomes. They have the same sequence of DNA nucleotides in all their cells. But throughout their lives, their genomes adapt to environmental conditions in slightly different ways. Therefore, with age, the number and location of “turned off” genes in their genomes varies more and more, and they become less and less similar to each other from the point of view of epigenetics, the science that studies the mechanisms of gene regulation.


The main stages of the implementation of hereditary information
in cells are transcription, RNA maturation, and translation. There are many types of RNA in living organisms. The most common among them are messenger, or template, RNA (mRNA, or mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and small nuclear RNA (smRNA). P.Topic 4


Replication, transcription, and maturation of RNA


22


You have already become familiar with the structural features of


nucleic acid molecules and the functions they perform in the cell. Remember which nucleotides are part of DNA and RNA. What stages of the implementation of hereditary information do you know?


Replication During cell reproduction, each daughter cell receives


an identical set of DNA molecules from the mother cell. This is possible because the DNA molecule of the mother cell is duplicated before cell division. This process of DNA duplication is called replication.


During replication, special protein enzymes unwind the double


strand of DNA into two single strands. After that, other
enzymes on each strand complete its mirror copy according to the
principle of complementarity: thymidylate nucleotide - opposite adenylate, and guanylate - opposite cytidylate (Fig. 22.1). Thus, the organism receives two identical copies of DNA, which can be distributed between daughter cells after the division of the mother cell.


Transcription As you already know, during the transcription stage, the mRNA molecule is synthesized


according to the model of one of the strands of the DNA molecule. During the synthesis of an RNA molecule, nucleotides are added to its chain according to the principle of complementarity (Fig. 22.1). Note that opposite the adenyl nucleotide in the DNA chain, the uridylic nucleotide in the RNA chain is placed (and not thymidyl, as during DNA synthesis).

Fig. 22.2. The process of transcription


Transcription is carried out by a large complex of enzymes, the


main of which is the enzyme DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Fig. 22.2). This name means that it creates a polymer chain of RNA based on the DNA molecule.


The transcription process begins when RNA polymerase


detects a promoter zone on the DNA chain. It attaches to the DNA in this zone and begins to move along its chain. At the same time, the double helix of the DNA molecule unwinds, and RNA polymerase reads information from only one DNA chain. It recognizes nucleotides on the DNA chain and attaches the corresponding nucleotides to the RNA chain (according to the principle of complementarity). New nucleotides are attached to the “tail” of the RNA chain being synthesized. The DNA section from which the enzyme has already read information is twisted again. The transcription process (RNA synthesis) ends when RNA polymerase reaches the terminator site.


RNA maturation (processing) RNA maturation is an important stage of the implementation of hereditary information


in eukaryotes. It is characteristic of all types of RNA and does not occur only in certain cases.


During RNA maturation (processing), the following occurs: — splicing (separation of introns and connection of exons in the synthesized


molecule using sRNA) (Fig. 22.3);


— addition of several modified


nucleotides to the beginning of the molecule, which help transport it into the cytoplasm;


— addition of several adenyl nucleotide molecules to the end of the RNA molecule


(polyadenylation), which helps transport it into the cytoplasm.

Fig. 22.3. The process of RNA maturation


The maturation process allows eukaryotic cells to carry out the so-


called alternative splicing, during which different combinations of exons can be formed from one RNA molecule. In this case, different proteins are formed from one initial variant. The scale of this process is evidenced by the fact that there are slightly more than 20,000 genes in the human genome, and there are more than 250,000 proteins present in cells.


Reverse transcription
In addition to the transcription process, cells can undergo a process


of reverse transcription. In this process, events occur in the reverse order compared to normal transcription. It is also carried out by a complex of enzymes, the main of which is the enzyme reverse transcriptase (it is often called revertase). This is a special enzyme that builds a DNA chain based on the RNA chain.

Viral RNA


Viral DNAVirusNew virus


Fig. 22.4. Reverse transcription


90. Replication, transcription and maturation of RNA


The principle of construction is also based on the phenomenon of complementarity.


Opposite the guanyl nucleotide of RNA in the DNA chain is a cytidylic nucleotide, and opposite the cytidylic nucleotide is a guanyl nucleotide. Uridyl nucleotide is not part of DNA, therefore, opposite the adenyl nucleotide of RNA in the DNA chain is
a thymidyl nucleotide, and opposite the uridyl nucleotide is adenyl nucleotide.


This process is especially often used by viruses, in which


the nucleic acid is represented by RNA (Fig. 22.4). They penetrate the cells of living organisms and there, with the help of the enzyme reversetase, form DNA from their RNA. And this DNA is then incorporated into the genome of the cell and begins to control the processes that occur in it.


To provide daughter cells with copies of the mother DNA, the process of replication (doubling of DNA) is used. The synthesis of organic molecules needed by the cell occurs using information stored in the cell's DNA. The first stage of the implementation of hereditary information is transcription - the process of synthesizing an RNA molecule based on one of the chains of the DNA molecule. This process is carried out by the enzyme RNA polymerase. The second stage is RNA maturation, which occurs in the cell nucleus. At the same time, introns are removed from the RNA molecule and additional nucleotides are attached to it, which help in transporting the molecule from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. P. Topic 4


Translation


23


Remember how many amino acids are included in the composition


of proteins. And how many nucleotides do nucleic acids contain? How are different levels of organization of a protein
molecule formed? And why, for the normal functioning of a protein,
amino acids must be placed in a certain order? Repeat what a codon is, and recall the features of the structure and main function of ribosomes.


Protein biosynthesis As you already know, the next stage of the implementation of hereditary information


is translation.


Translation, or protein biosynthesis, is a stage during which, based on


the information contained in mRNA, a polypeptide chain of a protein molecule is synthesized.


The translation process occurs in a ribosome located in the cytoplasm


of the cell. It should be noted that several ribosomes can “work” on one mRNA molecule at the same time. Each of them synthesizes one protein molecule. And all of them together with mRNA form a structure called a polyribosome.


Synthesis occurs according to the genetic code, that is, each


triplet of mRNA nucleotides corresponds to a certain amino acid (see the table of the genetic code on the second endpaper). For example, the AUG triplet corresponds to the amino acid methionine (Met), the AUC triplet to the amino acid isoleucine (Ile), and the nucleotides UAA, UAG, and UGA are stop codons, indicating the end of the synthesis of the polypeptide chain.


At the time of synthesis of a protein molecule in the cytoplasm ,


there must be a complete set of necessary amino acids. Recall that they are formed as a result of the breakdown of proteins that enter the body with food or are synthesized in the body itself.


Protein biosynthesis, like all previous stages of the implementation of hereditary


information, is provided with energy by the breakdown of ATP molecules.


The translation process consists of three stages: initiation, elongation


and termination.


92. Translation


The first stage of translation - initiationInitiation - the beginning of the synthesis of the polypeptide chain of a protein molecule


(Fig. 23.1, A). At this stage, the small subunit of the ribosome joins the mRNA chain, recognizes the start codon on it, joins the large subunit of the ribosome and transports the first amino acid to the ribosome, which gives rise to the polypeptide chain.


The start codon is always the AUG codon. A tRNA molecule joins it


, which brings the amino acid methionine to the ribosome, which will be the first amino acid of the future polypeptide chain. The tRNA molecule joins the mRNA molecule with the help of its triplet, which is called the anticodon, according to the principle of complementarity.


The second stage of translation is elongation. Elongation is the extension of the polypeptide chain of a protein


molecule (Fig. 23.1, B). After the start codon, the ribosome analyzes the next codon, recognizes it and attaches the corresponding tRNA molecule to it, which transports the next amino acid to the ribosome. In Fig. 23.1, B, the next codon is GUC, and the next amino acid transported by tRNA is valine (Val).


A peptide bond is formed between the two amino acids, and the peptide


chain is extended by this amino acid. The tRNA molecule is then released and leaves the ribosome.


After that, the ribosome moves to the next mRNA triplet


, recognizes it and attaches the next tRNA molecule, which brings the corresponding amino acid to the ribosome. It joins the previous amino acid, and the polypeptide chain is extended by one more amino acid.


The process of extension of the polypeptide chain of the protein molecule


is repeated until the ribosome encounters one of the stop
codons - UAA, UAG or UGA.


The third stage of translation - termination. The recognition of the stop codon by the ribosome begins the third stage


of translation - termination - completion of translation (Fig. 23.1, B). At this stage, the synthesis of the polypeptide chain of the protein molecule is completed, the ribosome again breaks down into small and large subunits ¬
, tRNA and mRNA molecules are released.


After the completion of the synthesis of the polypeptide chain, the ribosome subunits


can join a new mRNA molecule, and the tRNA molecules can capture new amino acid molecules and transport them to the site of synthesis of another protein.

Protein maturation After the end of synthesis, the process of protein maturation can occur


. During this process, some parts of the protein can be cut by special enzymes, the protein can change its shape, combine with other proteins or attach a non-protein part to itself.


Maturation is necessary because the protein that has just been synthesized


is not yet able to perform its functions. The result of maturation is the loss of some amino acids located at the ends of the chain and the final formation of the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of the molecule.


Using the genetic code table In order to establish the sequence of amino acids encoded


in a DNA section, you should use the genetic code table at the front of the textbook.


First, using the principle of complementarity, determine


the structure of the mRNA chain that is formed on the given DNA section.


For example, DNA chain: TACGAAT. mRNA chain: AUGCUA. Then identify the triplets that make up mRNA: AUG and CUA. The first nucleotide of the triplet indicates the row in which to look


for the amino acid it encodes, and the second nucleotide indicates the column. The cell corresponding to the selected column and row contains four amino acid names. The one you need is determined by the location opposite the third nucleotide of the triplet (indicated in the far right column of the table).


For the AUG triplet, this will be methionine, for the CUA triplet, it will be leucine.


During translation, information from mRNA is translated into the amino acid sequence of the synthesized protein according to the genetic code. This process occurs in ribosomes and consists of three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. After translation, the process of protein maturation occurs. P. Topic 4


DNA Repair


24


You have already become familiar with the features of the genetic


code. And what consequences can a violation of the sequence of nucleotides in DNA in the region of a structural gene lead to? Can this affect the structure of the protein chain?


Causes and possible consequences of DNA damage A DNA molecule, like any other molecule, can be damaged


. This damage can be different. One nucleotide or a pair of nucleotides can be damaged. One of the DNA chains or even both chains at the same time can break. There


can be quite a lot of reasons for such damage


(Fig. 24.1). DNA is often damaged by ultraviolet and radioactive radiation ¬
. Some chemical compounds are a significant danger. In addition, the cause of damage can be an error during replication. For example, during replication, instead of one nucleotide, another can accidentally get into the chain. Although this happens very rarely.


The consequences of such damage for cells can be negative


. Genes whose structure is disrupted may stop producing their products—RNA or proteins. For example, as a result of damage, one of the codons inside an RNA molecule will code for
a stop codon instead of an amino acid. Then only half


of the DNA is synthesized.

a protein molecule. It is clear that such a molecule will not be able to work and perform its functions.


DNA repair processes The process that allows living organisms to eliminate damage


that occurs in DNA is called repair. Most repair
mechanisms are based on the fact that DNA is a double-stranded molecule. That is, there are two copies of genetic information in a cell. If one of them is damaged, it can be restored using the second copy, taking it as a model.


The repair process occurs in several stages (Fig. 24.2). To


carry it out, cells use special enzymes.


DNA damage can be different. For each of them,


there are their own repair systems. Some defects can be corrected using only one enzyme, while others require the participation of a complex of enzymes.


Damage can occur under the influence of factors such as ultraviolet or radiation radiation, the action of certain chemical compounds, or errors during replication in DNA molecules. To correct DNA damage, cells have a DNA repair system. P. Topic 4


25 Cell cycle. Mitosis


You have already become familiar with the organelles of eukaryotic


cells. Recall what functions the cell nucleus performs. What components are included in the nucleus? Where is hereditary information stored in prokaryotic cells?


Chromosomes of eukaryotic cells As you already know, DNA in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells forms a complex


complex with proteins - chromatin. Chromatin looks like a thread (double strand) of DNA, which is wound around small protein balls formed by special proteins - histones. Protein balls with a wound DNA thread are called nucleosomes. They can twist in space, forming a thin spiral. And this spiral is able to twist into a spiral of a larger diameter, and then an even larger one and so on (Fig. 25.1).


The process of twisting DNA is called helixization, or condensation


, of chromatin. Its result is that a very long DNA thread is formed

Chromatids


are packed in a very small volume. But if DNA is packed too tightly, it will be impossible to read hereditary information from it. Therefore, chromatin in cell nuclei is not very spiralized most of the time: those parts of it that are needed for the cell to function are almost not twisted, and those that are not used by the cell at a certain moment are spiralized more strongly.


Preparing the cell for division Before cell division, spiralization


Fig. 25.2. The structure of a chromosome At the beginning
of cell division,


chromatin becomes the ¬strongest, because it is much
easier to correctly distribute DNA between the cells that are formed as a result of division. The consequence of this degree of spiralization is the formation of chromosomes - compact structures of DNA and proteins. Each individual strand of DNA with proteins has the shape of a rod (this is a chromosome).


But before cell division, an extremely important


process occurs - the duplication of all the cell's DNA. Therefore, at the beginning of cell division, each chromosome consists of two identical rods - chromatids, connected to each other in the zone of specialized DNA sections - centromeres. There is a centromere on each chromatid. On opposite sides of the centromere are the arms of the chromosome. Therefore, at the beginning of cell division, the chromosomes have an X-shaped (read as "x-shaped") shape (Fig. 25.2).


In eukaryotic cells, each chromosome is present in the nucleus in two


copies. The organism receives one copy of the chromosome from each of its parents. Such chromosomes are called homologous.


Cell cycle The cell cycle is the period of existence of a cell from the moment of its


formation by division of the mother cell to its own division
or death.


It consists of two main parts - the process of division and interphase


. During interphase, many processes occur in cells, including the process of DNA replication (doubling), RNA, protein synthesis, and other substances. Cells grow and accumulate substances necessary for the next division.


99. Topic 4


Cell division can occur in different ways. Prokaryotic cells


divide mainly by simple division. In this case, their bacterial chromosome (nucleoid) is duplicated by replication. The new copy is attached to the cell membrane, after which a new cell wall is formed between them.


In eukaryotes, the processes during division are more complex due to


the presence of a nucleus and hereditary material in the form of chromosomes. In most cases, the division of eukaryotic cells occurs in the form of mitotic or meiotic division.


Mitotic divisionMitotic division is a cell division that occurs during


asexual reproduction, as well as during the growth and development of organisms
. Such division ensures an increase in the number of cells, as well as
the replacement of somatic cells. Mitotic division consists of two main parts - mitosis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division). Mitosis itself is divided into four phases - prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase.


In eukaryotes, as a result of mitotic division,


two daughter cells are formed from one mother cell. In this case, the daughter cells receive the same number of chromosomes as the small mother cell.


Another part of the cell cycle - interphase - usually lasts


much longer than cell division. In this phase, the synthesis of ATP and protein molecules occurs, the number of basic cytoplasmic organelles increases, DNA molecules are duplicated, etc.

Disappearance of the spindle. Formation of new nuclear envelopes and nucleoli, chromosome uncoiling. After the completion of telophase, the cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis) and daughter cells are formed.


In some specialized cells of individual organisms (for example, in the salivary glands of some flies and mosquitoes), giant polytene chromosomes are formed during interphase. They consist of many DNA strands (more than 1,000), which after doubling do not diverge, but remain together. Such chromosomes allow a significant increase in the synthesis of individual proteins or other molecules. The large nucleus of the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax contains 16,000 chromosomes, each of which is represented by a large number (up to 2,000) copies. Thus, the total number of chromosomes in this nucleus is several million. But most of these chromosomes contain only one gene.


The cell cycle of any cell lasts from the beginning of one division to the beginning of the next. It consists of two main parts - the process of division and interphase. In most cases, the division of eukaryotic cells occurs in the form of mitotic division. The cells that are formed as a result of this division receive the same number of chromosomes as the mother cell.P.Topic 4


Meiosis. Sex cells and fertilization

You have already become familiar with the processes of reproduction


of plants and animals. What methods of reproduction are there in living organisms? How does sexual reproduction differ from asexual reproduction? Which system of the body is responsible for the formation of sex cells (gametes)?


MeiosisMeiosis is the division of cells that occurs during gametogenesis.


The result of meiosis is the formation of sex cells (gametes).


During meiosis, two cell divisions occur, as a result of


which four daughter cells are formed from one mother cell. In this case, the daughter cells receive half the number of chromosomes and half the genetic material that the mother cell had. Scientists say that there is a process of reduction (reduction in the number) of chromosomes, and they call meiosis a reduction division.


The divisions of meiosis are designated as meiosis I and meiosis II. The phases of both


divisions have the same names as the phases of mitosis. To distinguish which division is being referred to, the corresponding number is added to the names of the phases.


Between the two divisions, a short interphase lasts, during which


DNA duplication does not occur.

DNA RecombinationRecombination is the process when the chain


Fig. 26.1. Crossing over


DNA strands are broken into separate fragments, which are then combined in a different order. In eukaryotic cells, recombination usually occurs during the prophase of the first division of meiosis and is known as “crossing over”.


Homologous chromosomes participate in crossover


. They are cut by special enzymes in several places, and then exchange identical sections and are stitched together again by enzymes into a whole chromosome.


During crossover


, the genes of both parents of an individual, which are located in homologous chromosomes, recombine (Fig. 26.1).


Fig. 26.2. Mammalian sex cells


Sex cellsSexual reproduction is a type of reproduction in which


sex cells (gametes) are formed and the fertilization process occurs. Sex cells (Fig. 26.2) are formed as a result of gametogenesis. They contain only one chromosome from each pair of homologous chromosomes. Sex cells in different groups of living organisms can have different sizes, shapes, and mobility.

Has a head, neck, and tail. The head consists almost entirely of a nucleus covered with a thin layer of cytoplasm. In front of the head is an acrosome—a sharp, hard bump that contains an enzyme that helps the sperm penetrate the egg.


Has a special surface layer of cytoplasm and special membranes that cover it. Contains reserve nutrients in the form of yolk, necessary for the development of a new organism


Functions

Provides nutrients for the initial stages of the development of a new organism


104. Meiosis. Sex cells and fertilization


FertilizationFertilization is the process of union (fusion) of mature


male and female sex cells, as a result of which one cell (zygote) is formed, which is the beginning of a new organism. Depending on the characteristics of reproduction of certain organisms, fertilization can occur in different ways. External and internal fertilization are distinguished.


External fertilization is common among aquatic organisms. In this


case, gametes of both parents are released into the water and meet there. The advantage of external fertilization is that it does not require special devices for fertilization.


During internal fertilization, the meeting of gametes occurs


inside the body of the female. Due to the fact that such fertilization occurs under favorable conditions, the risk of death of germ cells is reduced. In addition, the development of offspring inside the mother's body becomes possible. This increases their chances of survival.


Sometimes crossover can occur not during meiosis, but during mitosis. This phenomenon is called mitotic crossover. It was discovered in ¬
some fungi, mammals and insects.


Meiosis is a cell division that results in the formation of germ cells (gametes), which contain half the DNA than ordinary cells. During meiosis, DNA recombination (crossing over) occurs in eukaryotic cells. Fertilization is the process of joining (fusion) of mature male and female germ cells, as a result of which one cell (zygote) is formed, which is the beginning of a new organism

Patterns of Individual Development


27


During the previous biology course, you have already become


familiar with the features of the development of different groups of plants and animals. Recall how these processes occur. What types of development are inherent in animals? How do they differ from each other?


Periods of plant ontogenesis As you know, ontogenesis is the individual development of an organism


from the moment of its sexual or asexual origin to death. Ontogenesis is divided into several periods. Although the general sequence of events in the ontogenesis of living organisms is similar, these periods are different for different systematic groups. Thus, the variants of ontogenesis in algae are very diverse. They often have complex life cycles. In terrestrial plants, the diversity of ontogenesis variants is not so great. The largest terrestrial group of plants is flowering plants. They distinguish four main periods of ontogenesis - latent, pregenerative, generative and postgenerative.


Periods of ontogenesis of angiosperms


Period


of ontogenesisWhen it beginsWhat happens


LatentFrom the moment the seed is separated from the mother plant


The seed is in a state of rest with minimal intensity of vital processes


Pregenerative


From the moment the embryo germinatesPlant growth and its accumulation of nutrients


Generative


From the moment the generative organs begin to form


Generative organs function. Plants bloom and bear fruit


Postgenerative


From
the moment the generative organs stop functioning until the plant dies


The processes of dying off begin to prevail over the processes of new formation


Periods of ontogenesis of animals The ontogenesis of animals is usually divided into two main periods -


embryonic and postembryonic. The embryonic period (


embryogenesis


)


lasts


from the moment of fertilization to birth (emergence from the egg shells). Postembryonic - from the moment of birth to the death of the animal.


The postembryonic development of animals can be direct or


accompanied by transformation - metamorphosis (Fig. 27.1).


Stages of postembryonic development of mammals


Stage When it begins What happens


Juvenile From the moment of birth Growth and development of the organism


Maturity From the moment of sexual maturity The formation and growth of new organs does not occur. Metabolism is balanced. Animal reproduction occurs.


Changes occur that reduce its adaptive capabilities.


Aging. From the moment when the processes of dying off begin to prevail over the processes of neoformation, until the death of the animal .


Plant ontogenesis is divided into several periods -
latent, pregenerative, generative and postgenerative
. Animal ontogenesis is usually divided into two main periods - embryonic and postembryonic. In the postembryonic period, several stages are distinguished - juvenile, maturity, aging. The development of the organism during this period can occur with metamorphosis or be direct. P. Generalizing tasks on the topic "Preservation ¬
