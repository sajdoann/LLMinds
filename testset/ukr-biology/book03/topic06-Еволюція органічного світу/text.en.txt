Development of evolutionary views. Evidence of Evolution

In previous classes, you have become familiar with the features of


the structure and vital activity of many groups of living organisms. Recall the main groups of plants and animals that you studied in previous classes. Is there a connection between the features of the structure and vital activity of these organisms? Which of them are the largest in terms of the number of species?


Development of views on the origin of species of living beings The question of the origin of species of living organisms has always interested


people. At first, they tried to solve it within the framework of religious views. But with the formation of the scientific system of knowledge, several theories were proposed to explain this phenomenon.


The author of the first scientific theory that explained the origin of


various species of living organisms was J.-B. Lamarck. But this theory had quite a few shortcomings. C. Darwin's theory was created later, and it was substantiated much better.

The process of evolution and evolutionary theories When talking about evolutionary theories, one important


point should be remembered. Evolution and evolutionary theory are not identical concepts. Evolution is the process of changes in living organisms, which causes the emergence of their new forms. And we can observe and reproduce this process in experiments.


Evolutionary theory is an explanation of the mechanisms of this process.


Thus, the theory of J.-B. Lamarck explained evolutionary changes by the internal
desire of organisms for progress. And according to the theory of C. Darwin, the cause of these changes was natural selection. Both theories explained the real facts of changes in living organisms, but in different ways.


Paleontological evidence of evolutionPaleontology is the science that studies extinct organisms that


once lived on our planet. Over the three hundred years of its existence, it has

Fig. 37.5. The evolution of cetaceans according to paleontology


has studied in detail the history of life of previous eras. First, it was possible to establish the sequence of the development of life, and then the time when these events occurred.


All paleontological data indicate that the older the geological


rocks were, the more primitive organisms left their remains in them. That is, over time, living organisms on our planet became more complex. Paleontologists were able to trace the evolutionary development of all major groups of living organisms (Fig. 37.5).


Molecular genetic evidence of evolution The advent of modern molecular genetic methods has made it possible to trace


evolutionary events that have left no trace in the paleontological
record. Organic molecules are not preserved in fossil form
for a long time. But they are reproduced in living organisms. Thus, information about past events is stored in living cells.


To identify this information, different organisms are taken and


the molecules they produce (nucleic acids and proteins) are compared.

Having assessed the degree of differences and similarities, it is possible to find out what the molecules of the common ancestor of these organisms looked like. It is also possible to construct a dendrogram - a diagram that reflects the family ties of organisms and the time of existence of their common ancestor (Fig. 37.6).


In addition to molecular genetic and paleontological, there are other


evidences of evolution. These are anatomical-morphological and embryological (similarity of the structure and individual development of organisms within the same systematic group). And the unity of the chemical composition and the main processes of transformation of substances in cells is good biochemical evidence.


Evolution is an objective process that we observe in nature and can reproduce in experiments. Evolutionary theories offer explanations for the mechanisms of this process. There is a lot of paleontological and molecular genetic evidence of evolution. The result of evolutionary processes is the diversity of modern living organisms. P. Topic 6


Populations of living organisms
and their main characteristics. Population as a unit of evolution


38


Remember what groups of living organisms you


got acquainted with in the biology course. How do they differ from each other? In what environments do these organisms live? How do they feed?


Populations and their characteristics A population is a collection of individuals of the same species that reproduce


themselves over a large number of generations and occupy a certain territory for a long time, functioning and developing in one or more groups of living organisms.


Each population has certain characteristics


that can be used to determine its state. This is the density, distribution of individuals by age and sex, the nature of placement within the habitat, the type of growth, and others.


Population size and density Population size is the total number of individuals in a certain


territory that belong to one population. For populations of small
organisms (especially aquatic ones), the number is calculated for a certain
volume (water, soil, air). Population size can change over time.


If we count not the total number of individuals, but the average number


per unit area or volume, then we can determine population density. For example, if the number of lizards on an island with an area of 12.8 hectares is 256 individuals, then the density of this population is 20 individuals per hectare.


Sex and age structure of populations The ratio of male and female sexes in a population has important


ecological significance. It is directly related to its reproductive potential. The sex ratio is determined as the ratio of the number of males to the number of females or the number of males to the total number of males and females.


A very important indicator for a population is its age structure.


This is the ratio of the number of individuals of different age classes and generations


152.


Populations

Age


, years 9–10 years. The population does not necessarily have to consist of individuals of different ages. For example


,
all


individuals


in populations of annual plants have the same age.


The


sex


and age structure of the population reflects


its ability to reproduce (Fig. 38.1) .


For example, if the population is dominated by old individuals or there are very few females, the population will not grow quickly.


Population as a unit of evolution Populations are the components that make up species of living


organisms. The totality of genes of all individuals of a population constitutes its gene pool. When some factor destroys part of the individuals of a population, it changes the ratio of different gene variants in the population's gene pool. And a change in the gene pool over time can also cause evolutionary changes. Therefore, it is populations, not individual organisms, that are participants in the evolutionary process and elementary units of evolution.


A population is a collection of individuals of the same species that reproduce themselves over a large number of generations and occupy a certain territory for a long time. Populations have certain characteristics by which their condition can be assessed: density, distribution of individuals by age and sex,
nature of placement within the habitat, etc.

Evolutionary factors. Mechanisms of primary evolutionary changes. Natural selection


39


In the previous paragraph, you learned about


populations and their structure. Why is a population considered an elementary unit of evolution? What is the population gene pool? Can it change?


Evolutionary factors Evolutionary factors are phenomena and processes that change the


population gene pool. Changes in the population gene pool can accumulate over time, and individuals in the population begin to differ more and more from their ancestors. This is how evolution occurs.


There are several factors of evolution.


Evolutionary factors Factor


Factor description Example of action


Mutations (mutational process)


The natural process of constant changes in hereditary information due to the action of mutagenic factors


In human ancestors, two chromosomes merged into one as a result of a mutation. Therefore, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and chimpanzees, like our common ancestor, have 24 pairs.


Population waves (waves of life)


Fluctuations in the number of natural populations that occur constantly due to climatic, biological or other factors.


Periodically, outbreaks of intensive reproduction of insects (for example, locusts) occur. In this case, animals can spread beyond the boundaries of their usual habitat.


Gene drift.
Change in the frequency of alleles of certain genes due to random processes, for example, a volcanic eruption, a flood or the entry of a small group of individuals into a new territory (founder effect) (Fig. 39.1)


When people arrived on the American continent, among the pioneers, by chance, there were no people with the allele responsible for the formation of blood groups III and IV. Therefore, before the arrival of Europeans, the inhabitants of America had only blood groups I or II


Isolation Separation of populations of the same species due to the emergence of some barriers between them (physical or ecological)


Populations that ended up on islands often could not contact with the mainland population and formed new species, like finches on the Galapagos Islands

Migration Movement of individuals from one population to another or to new territories


The pipefish from the Black Sea migrated to the Dnieper River, and from there through the Dnieper-Donbass canal it ended up in the Seversky Donets River


Natural selection


When patients use antibiotics, only those bacteria that are resistant to them survive


Differentiated survival of individuals in the population that are more adapted to certain conditions of existence


Types of natural selection. Stabilizing selection


There are three main forms of natural selection: disruptive


(disruptive), driving (directed) and stabilizing (Fig. 39.2).


Stabilizing selection maintains traits in an unchanged state. It


acts when the average value of a trait is most advantageous. It usually occurs in conditions when the environment changes little and organisms are well adapted to it.


Thus, representatives of the crustacean cichlids have remained unchanged


since the Mesozoic. Their individuals have a short lifespan and live in puddles. The living conditions in puddles are the same now as during the time of the dinosaurs. And the period when the puddles dry up, cichlids survive at the egg stage, which is very resistant to any external influences.

155. Topic 6


Directed selectionDirected selection promotes a change in a trait in a certain


direction. For example, insects, lizards, and a number of other species that hide between plant leaves are green or brown, while desert dwellers are sand-colored. And among butterflies that lived in England in the 19th century
, directed selection led to better survival of individuals with dark
colors. This happened because the development of industry led to the contamination of trunks with coal dust and soot. As a result, the trunks darkened, and predators were less likely to notice dark butterflies against their background.


In predators, protective coloring was established due to the fact


that its owner could sneak up on prey unnoticed, and in the victim it is a consequence of the fact that the animal remained less noticeable to predators. Those of them who did not have protective coloring during adaptation to life in such conditions died and left no descendants.


Disruptive selection Disruptive (disruptive) selection is observed when


animals with a trait that differs from the average in one direction or another have advantages. For example, among insects that live on small islands in the ocean, most species either fly very well or do not have wings at all. This situation has arisen due to strong winds that can carry insects from the island into the ocean. In order for this to not happen, you should either fly very well or not fly at all.


A vivid example of disruptive selection is the situation with the


divergence of the ancestors of humans and chimpanzees. The common ancestor of these species lived in Africa about 8 million years ago. It was an excellent tree climber, but it could also move on the ground. Therefore, it was able to colonize small forest areas located on the edge of the savannah. It lived there in the trees, and moved between the areas on foot.


After the onset of another cooling cycle on our planet


, the area of forests decreased, the size of the forest areas on the edge of the savannah also became smaller, and the distances between them became larger. Therefore, it was necessary to walk much more. In these conditions, individuals who either walked better and lived more in the savannah, or lived in the depths of the forest and moved in the trees, gained an advantage.


Disruptive selection led to the fact that those individuals that


remained in the forest became the ancestors of chimpanzees, and those individuals that lived in the savannah became the ancestors of humans.


156. Evolutionary factors. Mechanisms of primary evolutionary changes


Fig. 39.3. Examples of sexual dimorphism


Sexual selection Sexual selection, which


affects the characteristics of only one sex, is also considered a form of selection. Such selection is caused by competition between individuals of one sex for the right to reproduce with individuals of the other sex.


This form of selection contributes to the appearance of sexual dimorphism, when


individuals of the same species, but of different sexes, differ significantly in
appearance. Sexual dimorphism is clearly visible in
species such as deer, chickens, and some insects (Fig. 39.3).


The elementary factors of evolution are mutations (mutation process), population waves (waves of life), gene drift, isolation, migration, and natural selection. There are such types of natural selection as stabilizing, driving, disruptive, and sexual. Only natural selection is directed. All other factors of evolution are undirected.P . Topic 6


Species. Species criteria. Mechanisms of speciation


40


Recall the factors of evolution that you have familiarized yourself with


. Name them. Why do these factors act specifically on populations? What is natural selection and how does it differ from other evolutionary factors?


Species Evolutionary processes that occur at the population level and


cause the formation of a new species are called microevolution.


The final result of microevolutionary processes is the formation of


a new species. A species is a set of populations of individuals that are similar
in structure, functions, and place in groups of organisms that inhabit a certain area and freely interbreed in nature.


In nature, there are species-duplicates that are very similar


in external structure. Therefore, in order not to be mistaken, not a single sign is used to determine a species, but a whole complex of species criteria.


Species criteria


CriterionWhat characterizes


Morphological Similarity of the external and internal structure of organisms of the same species


Genetic Number and structure of chromosomes of the species, i.e. its karyotype. Each species has a clearly defined set of chromosomes


Physiological Similarity of life processes and the possibility of interbreeding


Biochemical Ability to distinguish species by biochemical parameters (structure of proteins and nucleic acids)


Geographic Distribution zone of the species (range). There are species with a discontinuous range and species with a very large distribution range


Ecological Conditions for the existence of the species, its place in the biocenosis, relationships with other species


158. Species. Species criteria. Mechanisms of speciation


Methods of speciation There are several possible ways of forming a new species. The most


important condition for the formation of a species is the isolation of its individual populations. The classification of methods of speciation is based precisely on the difference in the ways of creating isolation between different populations of the species.


Methods and mechanisms of speciation


Method


of speciation Mechanisms of speciation


Geographic (allopatric)


New forms of organisms arise as a result of the fragmentation of the range and the isolation
of individual populations. In each isolated population, the gene pool changes due to gene drift and selection. This is followed by reproductive isolation (the inability of individuals to interbreed), which leads to the formation of new species. The causes of the fragmentation of the range can be mountain processes, glaciers, the formation of rivers and other geological processes


Ecological (sympatric)


New forms of organisms occupy different ecological niches within the same range. Isolation occurs due to the inconsistency of the time and place of interbreeding, animal behavior, consumption of different food, adaptation to different methods of pollination in plants, etc.


Hybridization A new form of organisms is formed as a result of the interbreeding of two species. An example of such speciation is plum (a hybrid of blackthorn and cherry plum)


By polyploidy


A new form of organisms is formed from an old one by polyploidization (multiple increase in the number of chromosomes). This method of speciation is common in plants


Different types of organisms are distinguished from each other using special criteria of the species. New types of organisms can be formed in various ways: geographically, ecologically, by hybridization, polyploidization ¬or ¬

Adaptations are the result of the evolutionary process. Basic provisions of the modern theory of evolution


41


In previous classes, you have become familiar with the features


of the structure and vital activity of many groups of living organisms. Remember whether there is a connection between the features of the structure and vital activity of plants and animals.


Adaptation of organisms to environmental conditions Adaptation is the adaptation of living organisms to certain conditions


of their habitat. All adaptations are the result of the evolutionary process based on natural selection. Adaptations can occur to various factors of both living and non-living nature. But they are all aimed at increasing the resistance of living organisms.


The methods of adaptation can be different: — morphological adaptations (protective coloration, spines, thick


cuticle, hair cover, fat layer, etc.) (Fig. 41.1);


— physiological adaptations (stability of physiological parameters:


constant body temperature, oxygen content, carbon dioxide, blood sugar content, etc.);


— biochemical adaptations (stability of biochemical processes, production of


certain enzymes);


— ethological adaptations (behavioral reactions to avoid


dangerous situations, for example, fear of snakes and avoidance of contact with them due to fear of poisonous bites).

Convergence, divergence, parallelism The adaptations of organisms to environmental conditions resulted in


the processes of convergence, divergence, and parallelism.


Under conditions when related species find themselves in different conditions of existence


, the phenomenon of divergence occurs. This is a process as a result of which identical organs in different organisms begin to differ externally, although they retain similar features of the internal structure (the so-called homologous organs). In the case of divergence, related species become dissimilar (such as whales, hippos, and moose, which originate from a common ancestor) (Fig. 41.2).


Under conditions when systematic groups of organisms that are distant from each other


begin to adapt to the same conditions, the phenomenon of convergence occurs. This is the process of forming similar features in groups of organisms that are distant in terms of their level of kinship. In this way, the so-called analogous organs arise. In the case of convergence, species become similar (Fig. 41.3).

Fig. 41.4. Animals that have independently adapted to life in water


Parallelism occurs when


species that are quite close in origin adapt to similar conditions. In the case of external and internal similarity, the organs of such organisms may differ in different ways of adapting to living conditions. An example of parallelism is walruses,
true and eared seals. These three groups adapted to life
in water independently and in somewhat different ways (Fig. 41.4). But they are all representatives of the same order.


The difference in adaptation to life in water is clearly seen in


the example of true and eared seals. Both of these groups, during the transition to life in water, began to use limbs for swimming, which turned into flippers. But in eared seals, movement in water is carried out mainly due to the front limbs, which is why they are very large. And the hind limbs mainly perform the function of rudders. In addition, the hind limbs are actively used when moving on land. In true seals, on the contrary, movement in water is mainly provided by the hind limbs together with the back part of the body. These limbs do not bend and do not participate in moving on land.


Modern evolutionary theory The most widespread in our time is the synthetic theory of evolution.


Although there are other theories that explain the mechanisms of evolutionary processes. The synthetic theory of evolution was formed in the 1920s–1950s during the unification of the provisions of classical Darwinism and genetics. The most important sections of genetics for the formation of the theory were the theory of mutations and population genetics.


A significant contribution to the development of the synthetic theory of evolution was made by


scientists J. Haldane, R. Fisher, F. Dobzhansky, M. Vavilov, S. Chetverikov (Fig. 41.5), O. Sievertsov, I. Schmalhausen, J. Simpson and others.

Fig. 41.5. Some of the founders of the synthetic theory of evolution


The main provisions of the synthetic theory of evolution: — The material for evolution is hereditary changes — mutations (as a


rule, gene) and their combinations.


— The main driving factor of evolution is natural selection,


which arises on the basis of the struggle for existence.


— The smallest unit of evolution is the population. — Evolution is gradual and long-term in nature. Speciation


as a stage of the evolutionary process is a sequential change of one population by a number of subsequent populations.


— Evolution is non-directional in nature, that is, it does not go in the


direction of any final goal.


— Evolution is an irreversible process.


Adaptation is the adaptation of living organisms to certain conditions of the environment. The adaptations of organisms to environmental conditions have resulted in the processes of convergence, divergence, and parallelism. In modern biology, the most developed is the synthetic theory of evolution, which combines the basic ideas of the classical theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin and the achievements of modern genetics.

Human Evolution. Stages of Human Evolution


42


Studying animal biology, you learned that humans


belong to vertebrates and are representatives of mammals. What are the characteristic features of this group? Which of the mammals is the closest relative of man?


Man is a representative of primates. Closest relatives Man belongs to the order Primates of the class Mammalia. Primates


appeared in North America during the time of dinosaurs and spread to other continents. However, they became extinct in North America. Of the modern primates, the closest relatives of man are representatives of the apes chimpanzees and gorillas. Their last common ancestor, Nakalipithecus, lived in Africa 9.9–9.8 million years ago. The ancestors of man diverged from the ancestors of chimpanzees even later — from 8 to 5 million years ago. Other apes, orangutans, live in Asia and are more distant relatives of man. This evolutionary line includes such extinct species as Ramapithecus and Gigantopithecus.


Early representatives of the family Humans Modern man ( Homo sapiens L. ) is a representative of a separate family


Humans ( Hominidae ). The evolution of this family is currently very well studied. It includes 7 genera and about 30 species. Apart from modern man, all of them are extinct.


The oldest representative of the family


is Sahelanthropus , who lived approximately 6–7 million years ago. Ororin and Ardipithecus (Fig. 42.1), who lived 4–6 million years ago, were not very different from him. All early representatives of the family lived only in Africa - mainly on the border of the forest and savannah, although they spent most of their time in the forest and were good climbers. However, they already had certain adaptations for upright walking. They can be considered the first stage of human evolution. Fig. 42.1. Ardipithecus


164. Human evolution. Stages of human evolution


Australopithecus and their descendants Australopithecus are the next stage


of human evolution. They are already well adapted to life in the savannah and walking upright (Fig. 42.2), but they are still quite often in trees. They lived 4–2.5 million years ago in Africa. Two evolutionary lines


of Australopithecus


diverged from Australopithecus


. Representatives of the first specialized in consuming plant food and increasing body size. As a result, paranthropes appeared (lived 2.5–0.9 million years ago) (Fig. 42.3). However, the transition to a vegetarian diet led to competition between paranthropes and representatives of ungulates. They could not withstand this competition, which is why they became extinct.


Representatives of the second evolutionary line remained omnivorous


and increased their meat consumption. This line led to the appearance of the first representatives of the genus Homo.


The genus Homo was formed approximately 2.4 million years ago in Africa


. Its early representatives include, for example, Homo habilis (Fig. 42.4) and Homo ergaster (Fig. 42.5). Homo habilis was the first to make stone tools. The descendant of the first people is Homo erectus (Homo erectus)


Fig. 42.3. ParanthropusFig. 42.4. Homo habilis


(Homo habilis) Fig. 42.5. Homo ergaster


165. Topic 6


(Fig. 42.6) — already lived not only in Africa, but also in Asia and southern Europe.


Heidelberg man (Homo heidelbergensis),


who replaced Homo erectus, also lived in Africa, Europe and Asia. But then the paths of its various populations diverged. European populations became the ancestors of Neanderthals (Fig. 42.7), Asian populations became the ancestors of Denisovans, and African populations evolved into Homo sapiens.


Approximately 70,000–80,000 years ago, our ancestors


left


Africa and gradually populated all continents. Other species of this genus became extinct. But our ancestors interbred with them at least several times, and a small number of their genes remained with us.


The influence of natural factors on


human evolution


Natural factors had a huge impact on


Fig. 42.7. Neanderthal


evolution. Even while living in the forest, our ancestors had improved color vision, because


thanks to it it was easier to find ripe fruit. Therefore, in the structure of our eyes there are now three types of cones (perceiving blue, red and green colors), while most monkeys have two (perceiving blue and red).


The very exit of our ancestors to the savanna was forced: due to the


onset of glaciation, the area of forests in the world decreased significantly, because moisture from the atmosphere was spent on the formation of glaciers.


Existence in the savanna led to the improvement of upright


walking, loss of body hair to prevent overheating and consolidation ¬
of omnivory.


The influence of social factors on human evolution But social


factors became very important for human evolution. A lone primate in the savanna is a victim. But a group of primates has a good chance of survival. Therefore, all primates that have moved to life in the savanna live only in relatively large groups. Their sociality has increased.


But the forms of sociality in different primates differ. In baboons


, a pack is a very rigid structure with a clear hierarchy. But our ancestors did not have such a strict system. Their relationships were more


166. Human evolution. Stages of human evolution


Baboon Chimpanzee Human


Fig. 42.8. Well-developed fangs are a sign of greater aggressiveness in


peaceful primates, and the hierarchy is not so strict. This is clearly seen from the development of their fangs. In all primates with high aggressiveness, fangs are very well developed (Fig. 42.8). In humans, they are the smallest. The basis of the evolutionary success of our species was clearly not aggression.


After leaving Africa, the importance of social factors


increased even more. The success of the species was determined by the ability to transfer experience, teach and learn, interact in difficult situations, and the development of speech. It was they that allowed our species to survive.


The species Homo erectus includes the remains that the discoverers first called Pithecanthropus and Sinanthropus. These ancient people lived in Asia. Traditionally, representatives of Homo erectus are called archanthropes, Neanderthals are called paleoanthropes, and early representatives of our species are called neoanthropes.


Man is a representative of the Primate order. The Human family arose in Africa approximately 7 million years ago. About 2.5 million years ago, the genus Homo was formed, whose representatives began to make complex tools. Human evolution was significantly influenced by both natural and social factors. P. Topic 6


Worldview and scientific views on the origin of life


43


You have considered the features of the structure and function of


organic substances of living organisms. Which of them are biopolymers? What monomers form these biopolymers? Can cells do without any of these biopolymers?


Theories of the origin of life on Earth There are four groups of theories that explain the appearance of life on


Earth. These are creationism, the steady-state theory, the theory of panspermia, and the theory of biogenesis (chemical evolution). The main premise of any creationist theory is the emergence of life as a result of an extraordinary divine event.


Supporters of the steady-state theory believe that the Earth


is eternal. It has always existed, and life has always existed on it. This theory allows for the extinction of species, but believes that new species do not form. And the absence of remains of species that exist now in sedimentary rocks of ancient eras is explained by the small number of these species in those eras.


The theory of panspermia claims that life in the Universe arose once


or several times (as an option, it existed forever). But it did not arise on Earth, but was brought with the help of meteorites or other space objects, or artificially.


Biogenic theories of the origin of life
The most substantiated theories in our time are those that explain


the origin of life through chemical evolution from inorganic substances, the theory of abiogenesis. One of the oldest among them is the Oparin-Haldane theory, put forward at the beginning of the 20th century. In this hypothesis, the main attention was paid to the formation of proteins from simple organic compounds. And a very important role was played by coacervates (coacervate droplets) - vesicles of lipids that form in water. And the role of nucleic acids was not yet known at that time.


A significant role in the development of theories of biogenesis was played by an experiment


conducted by American scientists S. Miller and G. Urey (Fig. 43.1). In a sealed glass device, they recreated the conditions that were characteristic of the early times of


the planet's


existence (an atmosphere with methane, ammonia, and hydrogen,


electrical


discharges


, etc.). And a few days later, they obtained amino acids that arose through abiogenic synthesis.


The


RNA -


world


theory For a long time, there


was


a dispute among supporters of the theories of abiogenesis


about what appeared first - DNA or protein. DNA stores hereditary information, and proteins are catalysts, without which metabolism is impossible. Only after the discovery of ribozymes (RNA molecules that work as reaction catalysts) was the theory of the RNA-world formed.


According to this theory, first a system of self-


replication of RNA molecules was formed, which could be both carriers of hereditary information and catalysts. And only then did this system form a symbiosis with the biochemical cycles of protein molecule synthesis, which arose independently and under different conditions. This happened because proteins are better catalysts, and nucleic acids better store hereditary information. And only then did
DNA join this system, which stores hereditary
information more reliably than RNA.


The modern theory of abiogenesis cannot do without


coacervates (Fig. 43.2). According to the theory, they became the basis for the formation of cell membranes.


Time and place of the origin of life Most theories of abiogenesis consider the most


probable period of the origin of life to be from 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago. Regarding the possible place,

where life originated, there are many hypotheses. It is only clear that life originated in a solution. But in which one? The open ocean or sea has almost no chance of this: it is impossible to achieve a sufficient concentration of the necessary substances in such reservoirs. Of the options proposed by modern theories, the most popular are the following:


— hot freshwater reservoirs (Fig. 43.3); — hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor (Fig. 43.4); — the surface and cavities of pyrite crystals; — clays. In these places, organic substances of abiogenic origin could


accumulate and form solutions of high concentrations.


Stages of the origin of life The main stages of the origin of life in the Oparin-Haldane theory and


modern theories differ. In the Oparin-Haldane theory, they are as follows:


— the emergence of carbohydrate compounds and their derivatives; — the emergence of proteins; — the formation of protein bodies inside coacervates. Modern theories, considering the stages of the emergence of life, already take into


account the need for the formation of nucleic acids. Therefore, a larger number of stages are distinguished, although some of them could have occurred in parallel:


— the emergence of carbohydrate compounds and their derivatives; — the formation of polyaromatic carbohydrates; — the formation of reaction cycles that are capable of existing for a long time


and are based on the transformations of compounds formed by nucleotides or amino acids;


— the formation of the "RNA world";
— the use of proteins as better catalysts of reactions in the


processes of RNA reproduction;


— the emergence of DNA as a form of more reliable storage of information


from RNA;


170. Worldviews and scientific views on the origin of life


— the unification of biochemical cycles based on coacervates with the participation of


RNA and proteins;


— the formation of cellular life forms. The last universal common ancestor At the end of the 20th century, scientists came to the conclusion that there may


be a single common ancestor of all currently existing cellular organisms. It was proposed to call it the last universal common ancestor (in English, last universal common ancestor, or, for short, LUCA).


This hypothesis arose because all currently existing domains of


organisms (bacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes) have a number of common
properties. This is the storage of hereditary information in
DNA molecules, the presence of a cell membrane, protein synthesis on ribosomes, the existence of transcription, translation and replication processes, the similarity of basic biochemical processes, etc.


It is believed that such an organism could have lived 3.6–4.1 billion years ago.


But it was definitely not the only organism at that time. And before its emergence, it went through a long path of evolution from simpler structures. In addition, it is possible that such an organism as a separate species did not exist. And modern living organisms received their genetic heritage from the entire community of ancient organisms, which exchanged hereditary information among themselves through horizontal gene transfer.


The oldest remains of living organisms (stromatolites) are 3.7 billion years old.


There are several theories of the origin of life on Earth. The most well-founded theory at present is the theory of abiogenesis, which believes that the original conditions on our planet ensured the emergence of life from inorganic substances through chemical evolution.
