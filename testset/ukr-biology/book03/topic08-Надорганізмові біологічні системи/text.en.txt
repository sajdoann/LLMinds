You are already familiar with different groups of living organisms.


Recall how living organisms obtain the organic substances they need. What is the difference between autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms?


Ecosystems An ecosystem is a collection of living


organisms


that live in a certain habitat and form a single whole with it. Any ecosystem contains two main components - biotic and
abiotic. The biotic component of an ecosystem is
all living organisms that are part of it (animals, plants, bacteria, etc.). And the abiotic component is the components of inanimate nature (rock, water, air, etc.). The biotic component of an ecosystem is called a biocenosis.


The biotic component of ecosystems is divided into autotrophic and


heterotrophic


organisms (Fig. 47.1). Autotrophic organisms are able to form organic substances from inorganic ones either by photosynthesis (photoautotrophs) or by using the energy of chemical reactions (chemoautotrophs). Heterotrophic organisms obtain the organic substances they need from other organisms.

182. Ecosystem. Diversity of natural ecosystems


Diversity of natural ecosystems The size of ecosystems can vary from the size of a drop of water


to the size of an entire planet. But in the conditions of our planet, three main groups of natural ecosystems are distinguished. These are terrestrial, freshwater
and marine (saltwater) ecosystems. Each of these groups is divided
into smaller ecosystems of landscape and geographical zones (for land) or hydrological and physical features (for water bodies).


Among terrestrial ecosystems, tundra, broad-leaved


forests, taiga, steppe, desert and others are distinguished. Freshwater ecosystems are represented by flowing and stagnant water bodies and swamps. Marine ecosystems include pelagic (open ocean), estuaries (river mouths) (Fig. 47.2), coastal, rift (deep-sea), etc. There are also transitional types of such ecosystems, for example, forest-tundra and forest-steppe. In turn, these ecosystems are divided into smaller ones in size. For example, ecosystems of individual forest areas or lakes or river basins.

Biocenoses Biocenoses are not just a collection of inhabitants of a certain ecosystem


. Living organisms that are part of a biocenose actively interact with each other and with abiotic components of the ecosystem. They form both intraspecific and interspecific groups of living organisms.


Each biocenose is characterized by a certain species composition.


The species composition of a biocenose is understood as a complex of plants, animals, microorganisms that are in a certain biocenose, including all groups of organisms (species of all domains). Some biocenoses are extremely rich in their species composition (tropical forest), while others are poor (tundra, deserts).


Structure of biocenoses In most cases, biocenoses have a certain spatial structure


. That is, living organisms in them are located within the ecosystem
not by chance, but according to certain laws. Each organism
of the group occupies only its own place, which corresponds to the needs of the organism and its relationships with other components of the ecosystem.


Usually, organisms are located in space according to the amount of


solar energy that they need for life. A good example of such a location is the forest tiering (Fig. 47.3).


For example, in a broad-leaved forest, 5–6 tiers are distinguished: the


first (upper) tier is formed by trees of the first size (oak, linden); the second - by trees of the second size (rowan, wild apple trees); the third

and underground, since the roots of different plants also penetrate to different depths (Fig. 47.4). Animals that are part of the biocenosis also adapt to certain vegetation tiers. Thus, squirrels live mainly on plants of the upper tiers, and moles lead an underground lifestyle.


In the biocenosis, a horizontal structure can also be distinguished.


This is due to the fact that in any ecosystem you can find separate areas that will differ from the others. These are, for example, salt marshes, places where springs emerge onto the soil surface, rock formations, etc.


80% of the Earth's phytomass is concentrated in forest ecosystems. They occupy 4 billion hectares, or 30% of the land area. Every year, in the process of photosynthesis, the forest forms 100 billion tons of organic matter.


An ecosystem is a collection of living organisms that live in a certain habitat and form a single whole with it. Any ecosystem contains two main components - biotic and abiotic. The biotic component of an ecosystem is called a biocenosis. In the conditions of our planet, three main groups of ecosystems are distinguished - terrestrial, freshwater and marine (saltwater). P. Topic 8


Food chains, energy flows and the cycle of substances in ecosystems


48


You are already familiar with the features of the vital activity


of many groups of living organisms. Remember what and how different organisms feed on. How do the methods of nutrition of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms differ?


Ecological groups of living organisms All living organisms must eat, because to build their


organism they constantly need organic substances and the energy they obtain from these substances. Autotrophic organisms synthesize these substances independently, while heterotrophic organisms obtain them in various ways. They can eat autotrophic or other heterotrophic organisms or feed on dead organic matter. But, whatever they eat, the primary source of all organic substances and energy in ecosystems is autotrophs.


According to the method of obtaining organic substances, living organisms


in ecosystems are divided into ecological groups of producers, consumers and decomposers (Fig. 48.1). Producers are autotrophic organisms that produce organic substances. These include, for example, trees, algae and other plants.


Consumers are heterotrophic organisms of ecosystems that


obtain organic substances by feeding on other living organisms. They can feed on both producers (for example, herbivorous


Producer (spruce) Consumer (wild boar) Reducer (penicillium fungus)


Fig. 48.1. Representatives of ecological groups of organisms


186. Food chains, energy flows and the cycle of substances in ecosystems


animals) and other consumers (such as predators that eat herbivores).


Reducers are heterotrophic organisms of ecosystems that obtain


organic substances by feeding on the remains of living organisms or the products of their vital activity. Reducers convert dead organic matter into simple organic and inorganic substances.


Food chains in ecosystems By eating each other, living organisms become links in food


chains. A food chain is the relationship between organisms during the transfer of food energy from its source (autotrophic organism) through a series of organisms, which occurs by eating some organisms by others (Fig. 48.2).


In the food chain, each species occupies a certain link. The connections


between species in the food chain are called trophic, and the links are called trophic levels. At the beginning of food chains, as a rule, there are producers, that is, autotrophic organisms that produce organic substances. The following links in the chain are consumers. Depending on the location of the link, consumers of different orders are distinguished. Thus, herbivores that consume producers are consumers of the first order. Predators that eat herbivores are consumers of the second order. And parasites that live in the body of predators are consumers of the third order. Reducers destroy dead remains and waste products of organisms of all trophic levels.


Autotrophic organisms store energy in organic substances


, which is used by heterotrophs. During the transfer of this energy from link to link in the food chain, the majority of it (80–90%) is lost in the form of heat.

187. Topic 8


At the end of the food chain, the energy still stored in dead


organic matter is finally dissipated in the form of heat when it is destroyed by decomposers.


Energy flows in an ecosystem Energy in ecosystems can come from two sources. The first is


from living organisms - producers. The second is from dead organic matter. Accordingly, there are two types of food chains - grazing (eating chain) and detrital (decomposition chain) (from the Latin de ¬
tritus - crushed). The latter begins with the crushed remains of dead organisms.


In any biogeocenosis, different food chains do not exist


separately from each other, but intersect with each other. This is because organisms of a certain species can be links in different food chains. For example, tadpoles of frogs feed on algae and are consumers of the first order, and adults of this species eat insects and are consumers of the second order. Intertwining, different food chains form the trophic web of the ecosystem.


The rule of the ecological pyramid
Different biogeocenoses differ in their productivity. You


already know that there are different food chains, but they are all characterized by certain ratios of products, that is, biomass with energy consumed

Consumers of the second order

188. Food chains, energy flows and the circulation of substances in ecosystems


and stored at each of the trophic levels. These patterns are called the rule of the ecological pyramid: at each previous trophic level, the amount of biomass and energy stored by organisms per unit of time is much greater than at the next (on average 5–10 times).


Graphically, this rule can be depicted in the form of a pyramid


(Fig. 48.3), composed of separate blocks. Each block of such a pyramid
corresponds to the productivity of organisms at each of the trophic levels. Therefore, the ecological pyramid is a graphic representation of the trophic structure of the food chain.


Cycle of substances Biological cycle is the repeated participation of chemical elements


in the processes that occur in the biosphere. The reason for the cycle is the limitation of the elements from which the body of organisms is built.


In the biosphere, there is a constant cycle of elements that


pass from organism to organism, into inanimate nature and back to the organism. Elements released by microorganisms during decay enter the soil and atmosphere, are re-included in the biosphere's substance cycle, being absorbed by living organisms.


For the functioning of ecosystems, the most important are the cycles of


substances that are the main components of living organisms - Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Sulfur, Phosphorus.


According to the method of obtaining organic substances, living organisms in ecosystems are divided into ecological groups: producers, consumers and reducers. A food chain is the relationship between organisms during the transfer of food energy from its source (autotrophic organism) through a number of organisms. An ecological pyramid is a graphic representation of the trophic structure of the food chain. P. Topic 8


Biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors


49


Recall living organisms that live in a certain


ecosystem, for example, in a desert. To what factors will they have to adapt? Give examples of such adaptations for living organisms from different groups.


Ecological factorsOrganisms are subject to the influence of various environmental factors - ecological


factors, which by their nature can be abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic (Fig. 49.1). In order to adapt to the appropriate habitat, living organisms need to develop adaptations to prevent the negative impact of such factors.


Ecological factorsType


of factorsCharacteristics of factorsAbioticFactors


of inanimate nature - physical and chemical conditions of the environment. These include temperature, humidity, light, movement of air masses (wind), current and salinity of water, precipitation, snow cover,
the Earth's magnetic fieldBioticBiotic


environmental factors are understood as the mutual influence of living organisms on each other. Conventionally, biotic factors can be divided into intraspecific and interspecific.Intraspecific factors are manifested in the influence of individuals of a certain species on each other and competition for various resources. The manifestation of these factors is the struggle for territory, food, sexual partner. Interspecific factors are very diverse. In the process of evolution, several types of interspecific relationships have been formed (competition, predation, parasitism, commensalism, etc.). All of them are interspecific biotic factors. Anthropogenic


These


are factors caused by human activity. These include environmental pollution, unlimited hunting, habitat destruction, introduction of new species, etc.


The


influence of environmental factors on living organisms In relation to any environmental factor, living organisms have


the


so-called range of constancy (tolerance). If the intensity of


any factor exceeds the tolerance limits, living organisms die. For example, if an elephant gets into an area with an air temperature of –20 ºС, it will die quite quickly. Therefore, organisms try to live in conditions where factors do not go beyond the limits of tolerance and to which they are best adapted. Such conditions are called the biological optimum for a certain species of organisms.


Most environmental factors change independently of each


other. And it is quite difficult to choose a habitat so that all factors are within the biological optimum. Therefore, usually some of the factors affect living organisms more strongly than others. The factor that most affects survival is called limiting. Limiting factors can be temperature, pressure, water salinity, predators, etc.


Organisms are subject to the influence of various environmental factors ¬


— environmental factors, which by their nature can be abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic. Organisms try to avoid the influence of negative factors and live in conditions to which they are best adapted. Such conditions are called the biological optimum for a certain species of organisms. P. Topic 8


Stability of ecosystems and the causes of its disruption


50


From the previous paragraphs, you have already learned that


there are different groups of ecosystems. What are these groups? What components are included in ecosystems? How do ecosystems affect ecological factors?


Integrity and self-regulation of ecosystems Natural ecosystems contain a significant number of species of living organisms


. These organisms interact with each other, forming a single trophic web. All organisms in an ecosystem are interconnected. Although often such a connection is not direct, but mediated through other species. For example, earthworms and odd-toed silkworms are not directly related to each other, but silkworms eat tree leaves in the event of mass reproduction. Accordingly, the leaves do not fall to the ground, which reduces the food base for earthworms.


Together, all organisms in an ecosystem form a complex holistic


system that is in a state of dynamic equilibrium. That is, due to a change in one of the elements of the system, other elements compensate for these changes and correct the situation. Thus, in the case of mass reproduction of a species, the number of predators and parasites that feed on it increases sharply, and the number of the species decreases to normal values quite quickly. This ability of the system to restore its state after its disturbance is called self-regulation.


Relationships of organisms in ecosystems


Various forms of interaction of living organisms are of great importance for maintaining the stability of the ecosystem. In biocenoses, various types of symbiosis (forms of coexistence of two species) are observed.


The most common forms of interaction are competition,


predation, mutualism, parasitism and commensalism. Each species of living organisms is associated with many other species. Even using the example of humans, all possible options for interaction can be demonstrated. For example, humans compete with agricultural pests for food resources. And city swallows are commensals in relation to humans, because they use houses to place their nests.

Predation A type of relationship between populations of two species of organisms (predator and prey), in which predator organisms feed on prey organisms by attacking live prey


193. Topic 8

Fig. 50.1. Examples of ecosystem instability under the influence of abiogenic ( a ), anthropogenic ( b ) and biogenic ( c ) factors


Causes of ecosystem instability The ability of ecosystems to self-regulate also has certain limits. If


the influence of any factor is too strong, the dynamic equilibrium in the ecosystem is disturbed. This can lead to the destruction of the ecosystem and the extinction of many species (Fig. 50.1).


The cause of such disturbances can be the influence of any of the ecological


factors - abiotic, biotic or anthropogenic. For example, a volcanic eruption can simply destroy the ecosystem of a particular territory. Thus, in 1883, the eruption of the Krakatau volcano destroyed the ecosystem of the island on which it is located.


Biotic factors that disrupt the balance in ecosystems


often became new groups that arose in the process of evolution. Thus, the emergence of gymnosperms led to the fact that at the end of the Paleozoic era they populated significant areas of land where their predecessors — spore plants — could not grow due to lack of moisture. The formation of vegetation cover and the cessation of erosion led to a sharp decrease in the flow of mineral substances into rivers and seas. This led to the destruction of aquatic ecosystems and mass extinction of organisms.


The effect of the anthropogenic factor is often associated with the introduction of


new species of organisms into the ecosystem by humans. For example, in ancient times, sailors often left goats on the islands so that they could replenish their meat supplies when they came to the island, but without control
of predators, the goats quickly multiplied and ate up all the vegetation
on the islands. As a result, the islands turned into deserts.


Natural and artificial ecosystems The ecosystems considered above are natural. They


arose and developed without human intervention. Man is still a component of


these ecosystems.


Corn field Cow pasture Mollusk farm


Fig. 50.2. Artificial ecosystems


are part of these ecosystems. But it also forms its own ecosystems - artificial ones.


Artificial ecosystems are often considered a separate type of ecosystem


(agrocenoses). They are created by man and used by him for economic purposes (Fig. 50.2).


Such ecosystems cannot exist without human support.


They are dominated by organisms of one species, and they are not capable of self-regulation. These systems are regulated by humans. They also constantly remove substances from the systems (when they consume
the products grown in them). Therefore, these substances have to be constantly renewed
(fertilizers are applied).


Together, all organisms in the ecosystem form a complex holistic system that is in a state of dynamic equilibrium. If the influence of any factor is too strong, the dynamic equilibrium in the ecosystem is disturbed. Artificial ecosystems are often considered as a separate type of ecosystem (agrocenoses). P. Topic 8


Biosphere as a holistic system


51


Considering the topic of biodiversity, you have become familiar


with the domains of living organisms. Which of these domains contains the largest number of species? Where do representatives of these domains live? Are there places on our planet where you cannot come across living organisms?


Biosphere The concept of “biosphere” (from the Greek. bios - life) was proposed


in 1875 by the Austrian geologist E. Suess. The doctrine of the biosphere, as a special part of the Earth inhabited by living organisms, was created by the Ukrainian scientist V. I. Vernadsky, although, in his opinion, the French biologist J.-B. Lamarck first approached this idea.


The biosphere does not form a separate shell of the Earth, but is part of the geological


shells of the globe inhabited by living organisms. It occupies the upper part of the lithosphere, the entire hydrosphere and the lower layer of the atmosphere. This is the only global ecosystem of a higher order.


Components of the biosphere The biosphere consists of four components that are important


for its normal functioning.


Components of the biosphere


Substance Description Examples


Living The entire set of organisms on planet Earth


Bacteria, plants, animals, fungi


Biogenic Substance created and processed by living organisms throughout the history of the biosphere


Coal, peat, sedimentary rocks
(chalk), oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere


Basalt, granite, jade


Inorganic Products and substances formed without the participation of living organisms


Soil, silt


Bioinorganic Created simultaneously under the influence of both inorganic factors and living organisms. Living organisms play a major role in this process

Noosphere V. I. Vernadsky (Fig. 51.1) predicted in the first half of the 20th century


that the biosphere would develop into the noosphere (the term was proposed in 1927 by French scientists E. Leroy (Fig. 51.2) and P. T. de Chardin (Fig. 51.3)). Initially, V. I. Vernadsky considered the noosphere (from the Greek noos - mind) as a special "mental" shell of the Earth, which develops outside the biosphere. However, he later came to the conclusion that the noosphere is a certain state of the biosphere, in which human mental activity becomes a determining factor in its development.


A characteristic feature of the noosphere is the ecologization of all spheres of human


life. A person should approach the solution of any problems from the position of ecological thinking, that is, the preservation and improvement of the state of the natural environment.


The biosphere is the totality of all biogeocenoses of the Earth, a single global ecosystem of the highest order. The noosphere is a certain state of the biosphere, in which human mental activity becomes a determining factor in its development. The main components of the biosphere are living, biogenic, inert and bioinert matter. P. Topic 8


Protection and preservation of the biosphere


52


Recall how living organisms are interconnected


in ecosystems. What factors can affect the stability of ecosystems? Why is it desirable for species to live in conditions of biological optimum?


Biodiversity According to the definition given by the World Wildlife Fund (1989),


biological diversity is “the entire variety of life forms on Earth, millions of species of plants, animals, microorganisms with their gene sets and complex ecosystems that form living nature”.


Thus, biological diversity should be considered at three


levels. Biological diversity at the species level encompasses the entire collection of species on Earth. At a finer scale, biological diversity includes the genetic diversity of species, both among geographically distant populations and among individuals within the same population. Biological diversity also includes the variety of biological communities and ecosystems formed by them, and the interactions between these levels.


The value of biological diversitySpecies diversity serves as a source of all kinds


of natural resources for humans. For example, tropical rainforests with their richest complex of species represent a remarkable variety of plant and animal products that can be used for food, in construction and medicine.


Genetic diversity is necessary for any species to maintain


reproductive viability, resistance to diseases, and the ability to adapt to changing conditions. The genetic diversity of domestic animals and cultivated plants is especially valuable for those working on breeding programs to maintain and improve modern agricultural species.


Methods of protecting and preserving the biosphereMany technologies are used to protect and preserve the biosphere


. To this end, at various levels (scientific, legislative,


economic


, etc.) a number of measures are taken to preserve both individual species and entire ecosystems. Active public work is carried out. The so-called Red Books are created. The Red Book is an approved list of rare and endangered species, which contains brief information about their biology, distribution, and protection measures taken. And to preserve ecosystems, nature reserves are allocated. There are several types of nature reserves in Ukraine.
