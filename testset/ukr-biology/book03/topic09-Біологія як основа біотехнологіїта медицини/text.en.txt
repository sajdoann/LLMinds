Domestication of plants and animals


53


When you got acquainted with different groups of living


organisms, you considered their importance for humans. The most important among them were those species that were domesticated by humans. Recall the types of cultivated plants and domestic animals that you have become familiar with while studying biology.


Domestication of plantsDomestication is the process of changing plant or animal populations,


due to which they become adapted to being kept in captivity and used by humans. Domestication occurs with the aim of obtaining food, industrial


products (leather, fiber, etc.) from plants and animals, or for other purposes (transport, protection, etc.).


Domestication of plants by humans


occurred independently in different regions of our planet. The regions themselves in which domestication occurred had certain peculiarities. In addition to favorable climatic conditions, the presence of certain plant species with sufficiently large fruits and a sufficient number of people and certain social conditions were also required for the formation of settled settlements. Therefore, there were only a few centers of plant origin. These centers were discovered by the outstanding scientist, geneticist and breeder M. I. Vavilov (Fig. 53.1).

Domestication of animals The process of domestication of animals could occur in two ways.


The first is the classic formation of mutualistic relationships between two species. Such relationships often arise in natural ecosystems. The second is the purposeful domestication of animals by humans to obtain certain products from them (meat, wool, etc.).


The first way was the domestication of dogs and cats. Modern


domestic dogs were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in Asia.


Cats became domesticated a little later. They occupied the niche of “


rodent hunters” when grain reserves began to be created in the Near Asian center of plant origin. These reserves became the object of rodent attacks and, accordingly, the reason for the domestication of cats.


Other domestic animals were domesticated by humans purposefully


in the period from 8 to 2 thousand years ago. Most domestic animals
were domesticated in Eurasia in the same places where the centers of origin of cultivated plants were located. Only turkeys, guinea pigs and llamas were domesticated in America (Fig. 53.2, p. 204).

Fig. 53.2. Places of domestication of domestic animals


204. Domestication of plants and animals


Patterns of domesticationIf you look at where and which animals were domesticated,


you can notice strange discrepancies. For example, 10 thousand years ago, 72 species of mammals with a body weight of more than 30 kg lived in Eurasia. Of these, humans domesticated 13 species. In Africa at that time, there were 51 such species and none of them was domesticated. In America, out of 24 suitable species, only one llama was domesticated. In Australia, the only contender was
one of the kangaroo species (all the others were too small), which
never became domestic.


The fact is that for the successful domestication of a species, it must


meet certain requirements. Animals must grow fast enough, be unpretentious to food, form groups with a certain social structure in natural conditions (herds or packs), not show excessive aggression towards humans, etc. And if at least one of the requirements is not met, the domestication of the species looks extremely doubtful. Thus, the domestication of zebras did not occur precisely because of the excessive aggressiveness of these animals. And the domestication of elephants was unprofitable due to the too long period of their cultivation. Although the domestication of wild elephants was not a very difficult problem and was successfully carried out both in antiquity and in the modern world.


Plants and animals were domesticated by humans in the period from 10 to 2 thousand years ago. There are several centers of origin of cultivated plants and domestic animals. The most important species of cultivated plants were domesticated in Eurasia, Central and South America. Most domestic animals were domesticated in Eurasia. For the domestication process to be successful, animal species had to meet certain requirements.P.Topic 9


The concept of selection


54


Recall the laws of heredity formulated by


G. Mendel. What objects did G. Mendel work with?
In what cases are the characteristics of living organisms inherited in violation of G. Mendel's laws?


Selection Selection is the science of methods for


creating new varieties and hybrids of plants, animal breeds and strains (genetically identical) of microorganisms. Thanks to selection, it was possible to obtain a great variety of forms of domesticated living organisms.


Percheron (heavy truck)


The history of selection begins with the process of domestication ¬


of the first animals and plants. At that time, it was still spontaneous and had no scientific basis. Modern selection is based on the achievements of classical genetics and molecular biology.


In the process of selection, living organisms develop


traits that humans need (Fig. 54.1), for example, higher yields, larger
grain size, rapid growth, increased fat deposits under the skin, etc. However, this is achieved by
redistributing


the body's resources, so domesticated forms often have less resistance to diseases and adverse weather conditions.


Selection methods Selection methods for plants, animals, and microorganisms


are


quite diverse. But they are used taking into account the characteristics of the biology of each group. Therefore, the technologies of selection research for these groups of organisms are somewhat different.


Selection methods can


be divided into classical and methods using molecular biological technologies.


Classical methods of organism selection


Selection method Essence of the method Where it is used


Mainly in plant and microorganism selection, very rarely in animal selection due to the small number of offspring


Mass selection Selection of many individuals with the desired traits without taking into account the traits of the parents. The oldest and simplest selection method


In all branches of selection


Individual


selection Selection of single individuals with the desired traits taking into account the traits of the parents and compiling pedigrees (in animal selection)


Creation of pure lines


In plant, animal and microorganism selection


Breeding of homozygous
individuals with the same genotype for
a large number of genes


Hybridization: Artificial crossing of individuals with different traits


- distant hybridization


Crossing of individuals that are representatives of different species


Mainly in plant selection. In animals, most of such hybrids are infertile .


In animal breeding


, inbreeding


is the crossing of individuals of the same breed or even from the same family.


In animal and plant breeding,


crossing of individuals of different
breeds


is outbreeding.


Breeding is the science of methods for creating new varieties and hybrids of plants, animal breeds, and strains of microorganisms. Breeding methods include mass and individual selection, hybridization, distant hybridization, related and unrelated crosses. P. Topic 9


Traditional and modern biotechnology


55


Recall how humans use domestic


animals and cultivated plants. What things obtained from this use do you use in everyday life? How do humans use the ability of living organisms to cause fermentation processes?


BiotechnologyBiotechnology is a set of industrial methods used


to produce various substances using living organisms, biological processes or phenomena. The term “biotechnology” itself appeared
in the 1970s. It comes from the Greek words “bios” -
life, “technos” - art, skill, “logos” - word, teaching.


But in fact, man developed biotechnological principles a


long time ago. The use of microorganisms for baking bread, making cheese and other dairy products, winemaking, and brewing has been going on for more than one thousand years (Fig. 55.1). People simply did not know then that all these processes are carried out by microorganisms.


Biotechnology is conventionally divided into two sections - traditional


and modern.


Traditional biotechnologyTraditional biotechnology is based on the phenomenon of fermentation - the


use of microorganisms' enzymes in production processes. It is on this phenomenon that the production of bread, beer, wine, fermented milk products, and vinegar is based. The products of the activity of microorganisms


Fig. 55.1. Products made by biotechnology methods


208. Traditional and modern biotechnologies


Predatory insects Parasitic fungi


Fig. 55.2. Biological methods of plant protection


are such products as kefir, fermented milk, yogurts, and koumiss. Without the fermentation process, it is impossible, for example, to make cheese.


This field uses microscopic fungi and bacteria.


These are baker's yeast (for making bread), aspergillus (for making cheese), thermophilic streptococci and bulgaricus (for making yogurt and other fermented milk products), and other microorganisms.


Modern use of traditional biotechnology However, the traditional areas of application of microorganisms are currently


expanding. A number of medicines are obtained with the help of microorganisms (for example, drugs from the steroid group). All citric acid sold in our stores is produced by microorganisms. Monosodium glutamate, which is a flavor enhancer and is widely used as a food additive, is also produced in the same way.


Living organisms are also used as a means of combating pests


and plant diseases (Fig. 55.2). The use of natural pathogens of pest diseases is much safer than treatment with pesticides. Although this method has its drawbacks - slow action, for example.


And another new industry is the production of enzymes for household


chemicals. Every time you buy, say, laundry detergent
with enzymes, you are using biotechnology products.


New directions in biotechnology New methods in biotechnology include such directions as cell


and genetic engineering. They began to develop actively in the 60s of the twentieth century, when the role of DNA in heredity was established and the mechanisms for the implementation of hereditary information were revealed.


209. Topic 9


Cell engineering is a branch of biotechnology that develops


and uses technologies for cultivating cells and tissues outside the body in artificial conditions. In addition, cell hybridization technologies are developed and used within the framework of cell engineering.


Genetic engineering is a branch of biotechnology that develops


and uses technologies for isolating genes from organisms and individual cells, modifying them and introducing them into other cells or organisms.


Cell engineering There are several areas of practical use


of technologies developed in the field of cell engineering.


Promising directions of using


cell engineering technologies


Direction Scope of application


Industrial production of valuable biologically
¬active substances of plant origin


Pharmacy, household chemicals, food industry


Use of tissue and cell cultures for rapid clonal micropropagation and plant health improvement


Agriculture and forestry Obtaining


hybridomas (Fig. 55.3) by merging different ¬cells, for example, a cancer cell and a lymphocyte into one
cell


Pharmacy, medicine, biotechnological ¬industry One of
the


directions of cell engineering is the cloning of animals and plants


. Plant cloning, for example, allows you to very quickly reproduce the most valuable plant individuals that are distinguished by good yield, increased resistance to diseases or other qualities. This is especially important for growing trees, because it significantly increases the speed of their reproduction (Fig. 55.4).

210. Traditional and modern biotechnologies


Genetic engineering The essence of genetic engineering is the artificial


creation of genes with the desired properties and their introduction into the appropriate cell. The gene is transferred by a vector (recombinant DNA) - a special DNA molecule constructed on the basis of viral or plasmid DNA, which contains the desired gene and is able to transport it to the cell and ensure its integration into its genetic apparatus.


Fig. 55.5. Using the GFP gene to label cells of organisms The GFP gene, isolated from jellyfish, is used


to label certain cells of organisms


in molecular genetic studies. It provides the synthesis of a fluorescent protein that glows in the dark (Fig. 55.5).


Genetic engineering is widely used both in scientific


research and in the latest breeding methods.


Biotechnology is a set of industrial methods used to produce various substances using living organisms, biological processes or phenomena. Traditional biotechnology is based on the phenomenon of fermentation - the use of microorganisms' enzymes in production processes. Cellular engineering is a branch of biotechnology that develops and uses technologies for cultivating cells and tissues outside the body in artificial conditions.

Genetically modified organisms


56


Recall what methods of exchanging genetic


information are characteristic of bacteria. In what
cell structures is hereditary information stored? Why do bacteria adapt so easily to the emergence of new antibiotics? What are plasmids?


What are genetically modified organisms? Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms


whose genotype has been changed using genetic engineering methods using recombinant DNA technology (Fig. 56.1). Another name for genetically modified organisms is transgenic organisms.


Transgenic organisms can be of great importance for increasing


the efficiency of agriculture and during research in the field of molecular biology. The first genetically modified organisms obtained using molecular biology methods appeared in the world only in the 1980s.


Genetic modification of organisms in nature However, man cannot be considered the pioneer of


recombinant DNA technology. Such processes are very ancient and widespread among living organisms. Viruses infect all groups of living organisms and sometimes accidentally transfer genes from one species to another. This


process is called horizontal gene transfer. It plays
an


important role in evolution.


Bacteria were


the first to use gene transfer

DNA . This process is known to them as transduction - the transfer of bacterial genes to other bacteria using bacteriophages. Transduction is one of the main mechanisms of gene exchange in prokaryotes. It has existed for at least three billion years. Fig. 56.1. Scheme for obtaining recombinant DNA


212
. Genetically modified organisms


The history of eukaryotes also did not do without this technology. The origin


of the cytoskeleton, without which the vital activity of all eukaryotes (including humans) is impossible, is also associated with horizontal gene transfer from bacteria using viruses.


But the process continues today. Recent studies have revealed


gene exchange between rice and millet, and humans had nothing to do with it. The transfer of genes from the parasitic bacterium Wolbachia to the genome of its hosts — insects and worms — was also discovered. And in one group of rotifers, horizontal gene transfer has replaced the sexual process altogether.


Such gene transfers have also occurred repeatedly in human evolution


. A detailed analysis has shown that 1% of the human genome is viral genes. But in most cases they are genetic garbage, since they have been neutralized by the defense systems of our genome. And some of these “foreign” genes have become absolutely necessary for us. It is the genes of retroviruses built into our genome that ensure the functioning of the placenta and allow us (like other mammals) to carry a child in the mother’s body.


The first transgenic organism (mouse) was obtained by J. Gordon and his colleagues in 1980.


In the early 1990s, the first commercial test
of genetically modified varieties of tobacco and tomatoes resistant to viruses was carried out in China.


Genetically modified organisms are organisms whose genotype has been changed using genetic engineering methods using recombinant DNA technology. Processes similar to the technologies for creating genetically modified organisms often occur in nature and have existed for several billion years. P. Topic 9


The role of genetic engineering in modern biotechnology and medicine

You already know what biotechnology is. How long have


people been using biotechnology? What methods belong to this field? What importance do productions that use biotechnology methods play in human life?


Comparison of technologies It is very interesting to compare the technologies for creating GMOs


and the ¬technologies of classical selection.

technology


The question of the prospects for using genetic engineering in


the cultivation of agricultural raw materials continues to cause serious controversy among researchers and consumers. Among the positive arguments are increased yield, environmental benefits, and protection from pests. On the other hand, there is uncertainty among some consumers about the safety of new technologies.


Theoretically, a negative impact, for example, of transgenic plants


on other organisms is possible due to the presence of biologically active substances (insecticides, fungicides, etc.) in the plant organism.


The impact of


these substances can be direct or indirect through trophic chains. However, to date, no reliable experimental data on the negative impact of transgenic plants resistant to pests on non-target organisms have been obtained. Also, over 30 years of research, no reliable experimental data on the negative impact of GMOs on those who consumed them in food have been found.


In Europe, modified soybean and kuku plants


Fig. 57.1. Golden rice (a genetically modified variety that contains a lot of beta-carotene)


has been allowed for food production since 1997, compared to ordinary brown rice, and food enzymes and additives obtained as a result of genetic engineering have been used for more than twenty years. It should be noted that GMO products are cheaper than products of conventional breeding and may contain compounds useful for humans. For example, a genetically modified variety of rice (golden rice) contains a significant amount of beta-carotene (Fig. 57.1).


Applications in scientific research Genetic engineering is extremely widely used in


modern biology and medicine. It has become one of the main tools of both science and production. In scientific research, genetic engineering allows you to purposefully “turn off” the necessary genes. This helps to study their functions. It is also possible to introduce a gene into an organism that it did not have before and preliminarily test the consequences of using new technologies.


Important results can be obtained using this technique


in the field of analyzing the ways of implementing genetic information. Most
eukaryotic genes can synthesize several protein variants, and
it is possible to understand the operation of this mechanism only with the help of genetic engineering.


Production of medicines


It is currently difficult to imagine modern medicine without genetically modified organisms that produce medicines. Some drugs are simply impossible to obtain in any other way. Such medicines have been used for quite a long time. Since 1982, the mass use of insulin produced by a genetically modified bacterium began. The human insulin gene was artificially transferred to the mentioned bacterium. Until this, pig insulin was used in the treatment of diabetes, which often caused complications and allergic reactions.


215. Topic 9


In addition to insulin, genetically modified organisms


produce growth hormone, interferon, drugs for the treatment of myocardial infarction, drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, a number of forms of cancer and other diseases.


Diagnosis of diseases Genetic engineering technologies are actively used for the


diagnosis of diseases. Infectious, hereditary diseases, as well as various forms of cancer can be diagnosed in this way.


This diagnosis is based on the recognition of specific sections


of nucleic acids - DNA or RNA. This method has very high sensitivity and high reliability.


Gene therapy Gene therapy is a set of technologies that provides


changes in the genetic apparatus of human somatic cells. ¬
Its main purpose is the treatment of hereditary diseases. The main idea is to replace a defective gene in cells with a normal one. To do this, cells are first isolated from the body, a healthy gene is introduced into them and the cells are placed back (Fig. 57.2). Such therapy is carried out, for example, for the thymidine kinase gene in people with severe immunodeficiency.

216. The role of genetic engineering in modern biotechnology and medicine


Gene therapy already has examples of successful application, but


so far all these studies are conducted as experimental. After all, the technology is complex and requires a detailed study of possible risks and negative consequences.


Use in agriculture In agriculture, genetically modified plants


have been used on a commercial scale since 1994. The main area of use is to obtain plants with increased resistance to diseases, pests or natural conditions. Another important area is to obtain fruits with improved storage capacity. And the most promising direction of use in animal husbandry is obtaining milk from genetically modified animals. This milk may contain expensive or rare proteins that are used in medicine, but which cannot be produced with the help of bacteria.


The first successful gene therapy for humans was carried out on September 14, 1990. The journal “Human Gene Therapy” began to be published in the same year.


The most promising directions of using genetic engineering in modern biotechnology and medicine are the production of medicines, gene therapy, diagnostics of diseases and the production of agricultural products. Transgenic organisms can be of great importance for increasing the efficiency of agriculture and during research in the field of molecular biology. Over 30 years of research, no reliable data have been obtained on the negative impact of GMOs on humans and other types of living organisms. P.
