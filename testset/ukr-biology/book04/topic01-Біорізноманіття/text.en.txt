Systematics - the science of the diversity of organisms

What is heredity and variability of organisms? What is a species? What groups of living organisms did you get acquainted with in previous classes? What is the evolution of organisms?


Biodiversity of our planet as a consequence of evolution One of the main properties of living organisms is the ability to reproduce and vary. The first cells that appeared on our planet more than 3.5 billion years ago also had them. They existed in certain conditions that were optimal for them. But their constant reproduction and spread became the reasons that some of their descendants fell into new conditions for them, less optimal. And even in the old place of their existence, conditions could change over time. The ability of living organisms to change contributed to the appearance among their descendants of certain forms, for which the new conditions were already comfortable. And they began to reproduce quite successfully. The process was repeated many times. It continues today. We call it the evolution of living organisms. The result of evolution was the emergence of a large number of new forms of living organisms. After all, there are many places on our planet with diverse living conditions, which can change over time.
Continents move, the climate becomes hotter, and then
colder. And living organisms themselves also significantly affect their neighbors on the planet. As of 2011, more than 1.2 million species of modern living organisms have been described. And the number of extinct organisms, according to some estimates, may reach 500 million. In order to understand this diversity, a separate branch of biology was created - biological systematics.

Diversity of living organisms in Ukraine Many species of living organisms also live on the territory of Ukraine. The fauna (animal community) of Ukraine numbers over 46,000 species. The most numerous of them are insects — 35,000, other arthropods — over 3,500 species, fish — over 200, amphibians — 20, reptiles — 23, birds — 424, mammals — 132. The flora (plant community) of Ukraine is also rich and numbers over 27,000 species. However, over 15,000 of them are fungi and fungus-like organisms, which, according to modern taxonomy, do not belong to plants. But the name “flora” is also traditionally used for these groups of organisms.

Sections of systematics: taxonomy
and nomenclatureBiological systematics is a section of biology that forms a single system of the living world based on the allocation of biological taxa (systematic units) and the corresponding names given according to certain rules (rules of biological nomenclature). The modern system of classification levels was proposed by Carl Linnaeus (Fig. 3.1). Biological systematics is divided into two main sections: taxonomy and biological nomenclature.


13. TOPIC 1


Taxonomy deals with the development of rules for grouping living organisms. This is a very complex problem, because it is often not entirely clear on the basis of which features organisms should be combined into groups. For example, in ancient times whales were classified as fish because they live in water. But analysis of the internal structure of these animals confirmed their belonging to mammals. Biological nomenclature develops rules for naming living organisms, creates special international codes that regulate controversial issues. It also solves problems of synonymy (when one species accidentally receives several names) and other important problems.


Principles of scientific classification of organisms Modern systematics is based on the following basic principles: the system should reflect the evolutionary relationships between living organisms and indicate the level of their kinship; it should be convenient to use and allow easy addition of new, recently discovered species;
the main systematic category is the species, related species
are combined into higher taxonomic units - genera, genera - into families, and the latter - into even larger groups (Fig. 3.2); organisms included in the same taxon must originate from a common ancestor.

groups


of


living organisms are divided into monophyletic and polyphyletic (from the Greek. mono - one, poli - many). Monophyletic taxa unite all descendants of one ancestor, and polyphyletic - different arbitrarily selected descendants of several ancestors. Thus, the class Monocots is a monophyletic taxon, and the traditional kingdom Plants is polyphyletic, since it unites several unrelated groups (for example, various algae,
higher plants).
In modern systematics, polyphyletic taxa are considered unacceptable. If it is possible to prove that a group is polyphyletic, taxonomists eliminate it or change its boundaries to exclude unrelated species. For example, in the past, groups such as Invertebrates and Mycorrhizae were eliminated, and in recent years, significant changes have affected the boundaries of the kingdoms of Plants, Animals, and Fungi.


Previously, separate orders Artiodactyls and Cetacea were distinguished in the class Mammalia. But it turned out that these two groups have a common origin. The last common ancestor of these groups gave rise to two lineages, one of which became the ancestors of pigs, and the second split into the lineages of ruminant artiodactyls and whales, along with hippos. Thus, according to the rules of taxonomy, these two lineages are now combined into one order - Cetacea..TOPIC 1


Species concepts. Species criteria


4


What is a species? What criteria for a species do you know? What are the methods of speciation? What is sexual dimorphism? What groups of organisms are called monophyletic? polyphyletic?


Modern concepts of a biological species The difficulty of dividing living beings into species also lies in the fact that the very definition of the concept of "species" is quite complex. And it depends
on which of the concepts of species is used in a particular case.


Some common concepts of a species


Name
of the concept Definition of a species Features of the concept


Typological This is a group of individuals that are identical to a reference individual in certain respects


All individuals of a species are compared with a reference sample. This concept is very inconvenient for species, individuals of which can differ greatly in external features, for example, a domestic dog, a horse (Fig. 4.1)


There are only individuals, and species are a purely theoretical concept, because living organisms in nature are constantly changing. Within its limits, for example, it is difficult to explain the very long existence of ginkgo or shields (Fig. 4.2)


Nominalistic This is a group of individuals that is recognized by formal classification and represents a certain stage in the development of a certain evolutionary line


Biological This is
a group of individuals that are able to interbreed and produce fertile offspring


The concept is well suited to describing multicellular organisms with sexual reproduction, but has difficulties when describing organisms that do not reproduce sexually, such as bacteria


Phylogenetic (the most common in our time)


This is the smallest monophyletic group that deserves formal recognition


This concept defines a species based on its monophyletic origin (from a single population or even a single individual). It is not successful for defining species that arose through interbreeding or symbiogenesis

Species criteriaIn nature, there are species-doubles that are very similar to each other in external signs. Therefore, in order not to be mistaken, to determine the species, not a single sign is used, but a whole complex of species criteria (pp. 18–19)..TOPIC 1

Non-cellular life forms

What types of cells exist? What functions do DNA, RNA, ATP perform in a cell? Why do cells need proteins? How are proteins and nucleic acids synthesized in cells? What are enzymes and what are they needed for?


What are viruses? Viruses are biological systems that do not have a cellular structure. Therefore, they do not have cells. Viruses exist in two forms: extracellular and cellular. In the extracellular form, viruses are in the form of virions - particles that have a constant shape and a fairly simple structure. In this form, they cannot carry out the processes of self-reproduction and metabolism. The main task of this form of the virus is to find a new host cell and penetrate it. In the cellular form of existence, viruses carry out the process of self-reproduction, using the resources and components of the host cell. At the end of the period of existence of this form, a large number of new virions accumulate in the cell, which go out into the external environment and begin to search for other cells (Fig. 5.1).

20. Biodiversity


Viruses can reproduce only in living cells, because the synthesis of the substances they consist of requires ribosomes, tRNA, ATP molecules, enzymes and other components of cellular structures that are responsible for the synthesis of organic substances and which viruses themselves do not have. Therefore, all viruses without exception are intracellular parasites. They are not capable of carrying out self-reproduction processes independently.


Structure of viruses
Viruses can be simple and complex. Simple viruses contain
only nucleic acid and a protein shell (capsid) that surrounds this acid (Fig. 5.2). Virions of complex viruses differ from simple ones in the presence of a lipoprotein shell, very similar to cell membranes (Fig. 5.3). This is not surprising, because this shell is formed from a section of the cell membrane of the cell in which it has reproduced. It also includes specific proteins of the virus itself, which perform mainly a receptor function (recognize a cell for damage). Under the lipoprotein shell of the virion of a complex virus is a capsid - a shell consisting of proteins. Inside the capsid is a nucleic acid containing hereditary information. In addition, enzymes that help the virus capture the host cell can be located there. Nucleic acids inside the capsid can be of only one type - either RNA or DNA. Viruses, respectively, are divided into two large groups - RNA viruses and DNA viruses.

Bacteriophage viruses also have a complex structure (Fig. 5.4).
They parasitize in bacterial cells. The specific structure helps
the bacteriophage to securely attach to the bacterium and introduce its nucleic acid into it.


Other non-cellular life forms In addition to viruses, non-cellular life forms also include viroids and prions. As mentioned above, viruses contain at least nucleic acid and proteins. Viroids and prions have only one of these two components - either nucleic acid or protein. Viroids are circular RNA molecules and do not contain any proteins. They are located in the nuclei or chloroplasts of plant cells and use their enzyme systems for their own reproduction. Viroids can be pathogens of some plant diseases (Fig. 5.5). Prions are proteins and do not contain nucleic acid. They are synthesized like ordinary proteins and normally perform important functions in cells. Thus, the normal form of the human prion protein is involved in the functioning of nerve cell membranes. Sometimes prions can change their structure (primarily the secondary one). A protein chain folded in a different way becomes very resistant to any influences that disrupt its structure. In a modified state, it ceases to perform its usual functions in the cell. And during a “meeting” with the same normal protein, it initiates its transformation into the prion form (Fig. 5.6). Dangerous diseases of animals and humans (scrapey, chickenpox, etc. ) arise as a result of the action of prions.


Where did viruses come from? There are three main versions of the appearance of viruses.


22. Biodiversity


Version 1. Viruses originated from bacteria that switched to intracellular parasitism and lost most of their genes. This version is supported by the existence of the mimivirus. This virus was
discovered recently (2003). Its virions are large
, they can even be seen with a light microscope. And its genome contains 911 genes, which is much more than the minimum requirement for viruses. Version 2. Viruses are former genes that switched to a parasitic mode of existence and acquired the ability to move between cells. This version is confirmed by the existence of transposons - mobile genetic elements that are able to move within the cell's genome and be transmitted from one cell to another. Plasmids are also a probable precursor of viruses - short circular DNA molecules that bacteria can exchange. Version 3. Viruses originate from precellular life forms that have survived since the time when cells did not yet exist. This option well explains the presence of a large number of forms with RNA as the main carrier of hereditary information among viruses. It is the RNA world that is considered the predecessor of cellular life forms. And DNA, according to modern ideas, began to be used to store hereditary information at later stages of evolution. It is quite possible that different viruses actually have different origins. Therefore, different versions will be correct for different groups of viruses.


One of the most famous prion diseases is kyu, which affects the human brain. This disease was discovered in New Guinea and has now practically disappeared. The main way of transmission of infection was ritual cannibalism, when after a person's death, his body was eaten by other members of the tribe. TOPIC 1


The life cycle of viruses. The importance of viruses in nature and human life


6


What is the life cycle of an organism? How do viruses differ from bacteria? What is endocytosis? What is
gene transfer? What is the cytoskeleton?


The life cycle of virusesThe life cycle of viruses consists of several stages (Fig. 6.1). Stage 1. Recognition of the host cell and penetration into it. The virion recognizes the host cell using specific receptors located on its surface. That is why viruses usually do not infect the entire body, but specific tissues and organs. For example, the hepatitis A virus infects liver cells, and the rabies virus - brain cells. After recognizing the cell, the virus contacts its membrane. It can pierce it and inject its nucleic acid into the cell (this is what bacteriophages do), or it can disguise itself as a food particle and enter the cell during endocytosis (Fig. 6.2).

Fig. 6.2. Ways of virus entry into the cell


It is more difficult for viruses to enter the cells of plants and fungi, which have a thick and strong cell wall. In such cases, they enter the cell through damaged areas (for example, with the help of blood-sucking insects) or spread through plasmodesmata (channels that connect cells to each other). Stage 2. Introduction of nucleic acid into the cytoplasm of the host cell. At this stage of the cycle, the virus sheds its protein coat and releases nucleic acid into the cytoplasm of the cell, if it did not shed it at the first stage during penetration into the cell, as, for example, bacteriophages do. Stage 3. Interaction of the virus with the genetic apparatus of the cell. The virus can block the work of the genetic apparatus of the cell, or can independently produce nucleic acids and proteins. In some cases, it is embedded in the DNA of the cell. At this stage, a provirus is formed (the term prophage is used for bacteriophages). The provirus can exist in the cell for a long time without external manifestations. During cell division, it multiplies together with the cell genome due to the work of its enzymes. But under the influence of certain factors (for example, weakening of the body's immunity), the provirus is activated and turns into an active virus. Stage 4. Synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids of the virus. This stage
occurs in the host cell. The synthesized components self-assemble
into new virions. Stage 5. Exit of viruses from the cell. Often this stage is associated with lysis (complete destruction of the cell). But the so-called moderate


25. TOPIC 1


Fig. 6.3. Caterpillar infected with a


phage virus after integration into the DNA of the host cell do not immediately cause cell lysis. Their DNA can remain in the DNA of the bacterium for a long time. And only in some cases, under the influence of external environmental factors (for example, UV radiation), the virus is activated and causes cell lysis. There are also viruses that do not kill the cell. They multiply in it, and individual virions gradually come out through the cell membrane.


Fig. 6.4. The effect of phage therapy - attack by bacteriophages of a pathogenic bacterium


Biological methods of combating harmful species As you already know, viruses are intracellular parasites. One of their characteristic features is high species specificity, that is, the ability to infect only certain types of organisms. This is due to the fact that the receptors on the surface of virions very accurately recognize the receptors of the cells to which they attach. Therefore, viruses can be used as a convenient means of combating organisms that harm humans. These are both pathogens of diseases (for example, intestinal ones), and pests that harm cultivated plants (Fig. 6.3) or domestic animals. Viruses infect only certain
types of organisms, which favorably distinguishes
them from other means of control. Thus, antibiotics usually have a broad effect and destroy not only pathogenic bacteria, but also beneficial intestinal microbiota. Bacteriophages kill only the causative agent of the disease. Such phage therapy allows for the treatment of


26. Biodiversity


of diseases caused by streptococci, staphylococci, pathogens of bacterial dysentery and other microorganisms (Fig. 6.4).


Viruses as a tool of evolution Viruses play an important role in the evolution of living organisms, but not all, but some of them, which do not have a clear specialization and can infect different types of organisms. Such viruses can transfer genes from one type of organism to another, carrying out the so-called horizontal gene transfer. This is how the ancestors of eukaryotes received the gene for the synthesis of glycolysis enzymes from bacteria. Cells have several mechanisms that protect them from infection by viruses. Thus, a cell can block a virus after it is integrated into its genome. And some viruses can then be used by the body to its advantage (the so-called phenomenon of "domestication" of viruses). It is in this way that placental mammals received genes from retroviruses that allow their placenta to mask the embryo from the mother's immune system. Another role of viruses in evolution is the selection of organisms for resistance to diseases. Thus, thanks to the selection and death of part of the European population, modern Europeans have acquired sufficient resistance to the effects of measles and chickenpox viruses.


Bacteria and archaea have an original system of protection against viruses, which is
called CRISPR. If the attack of a bacteriophage on a cell is unsuccessful, then fragments of the bacteriophage DNA are integrated into the genome (CRISPR system) of the host cell. And these sections of the integrated bacteriophage DNA become a template for the prokaryotic cell, according to which it recognizes and destroys the virus. TOPIC 1


Prokaryotic organisms


7


What organisms belong to prokaryotes? What are the characteristic features of their cells? What is metabolism? What happens during the processes of fermentation, nitrogen fixation, photosynthesis, chemosynthesis? How do prokaryotes reproduce?


The structure of a prokaryotic cell Prokaryotes are the simplest cellular organisms. They do not have nuclei in their cells. Ribosomes and a nucleoid (DNA molecule) are necessarily present in the cell (Fig. 7.1). Ribosomes float freely in the cytoplasm, and the nucleoid is usually attached at one point to the cell membrane. Some prokaryotes may form other intracellular structures (chlorosomes, thylakoids, etc.). On the outside, most prokaryotic cells are covered with a cell wall. Some prokaryotes have flagella.


Morphological forms of prokaryotes The external structure of prokaryotes is not very diverse. Most of them are represented by cells that have the shape of a ball (cocci), a comma (vibrion) or a rod. There are spiral (spirilla and spirochetes), filamentous, discoid, stellate and other forms (Fig. 7.2).
Prokaryotic cells can unite in colonies. Often the number
of cells that have united is characteristic of a certain type of pro

karyote cells. According to the number of united cells and their shape, diplococci (two cocci cells), tetracocci (four cells), sarcinae (eight cells or more), and others are distinguished. If cocci cells unite in chains, they are called streptococci. In the case when the union of cells resembles a bunch of grapes, it is staphylococcus. Rarely, but prokaryotes also have a multicellular structure (some cyanobacteria). The body of such species is formed by chains of cells, the cytoplasms of which are connected to each other. In some cases, there is even specialization of cells within a multicellular organism. Flagella on the surface of prokaryotic cells can be located in different ways - at one end of the cell, at two opposite ends, or over its entire surface. Their number can also vary - from one to several hundred.


Features of the life of prokaryotes Due to the relatively small diversity of their morphological, i.e. external, structure, prokaryotes have many variants of metabolism. They can carry out the processes of fermentation, nitrogen fixation, photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, and others.


29. TOPIC 1


An important feature of prokaryotes is that they belong to osmotrophs. Osmotrophs are organisms that obtain the substances they need from the environment through the cell membrane, using the phenomenon of osmosis, that is, they absorb what they need for
their life with their entire surface.


Methods of reproduction Prokaryotes reproduce mainly by simple division, when the cell grows to a certain size and then divides in half. In this case, the nucleoid doubles inside the cell. But this method is not the only one. In some prokaryotes, budding may occur. During budding, a small protrusion forms on the surface of the cell, which enlarges and then separates from the mother cell, forming a new organism. In some species, the living contents of the mother cell are divided into several parts, each of which turns into a new cell (multiple division). Sexual reproduction is absent in prokaryotes. But they can exchange genetic information in other ways.


Methods of exchanging hereditary information


Conjugation


Direct contact between two bacterial cells using special hollow tubes, F-piles, during which genetic material from one cell is transferred to another


Transformation


Transfer of DNA that has been removed from the cell (most often during cell destruction) from one bacterial cell to other bacterial cells


30. Biodiversity


Transduction


Transfer of bacterial genes from one cell to another using a bacteriophage. TOPIC 1


Diversity of prokaryotes. Bacteria and archaea

What are bacteria? How can humans use bacteria? What is the difference between autotrophs and heterotrophs? What are mutualism, commensalism, parasitism?


Bacteria and Archaea Prokaryotes are divided into two large groups - archaea and bacteria (Fig. 8.1). Archaea are considered the direct ancestors of eukaryotes. This is a very ancient group of organisms that often live in conditions of extreme pressure, acidity, salinity, etc. Such conditions were common on Earth 2–3 billion years ago. The division of bacteria into large systematic groups is still the subject of scientific discussion. If the unification of species into groups of the rank of the department does not cause any special problems, then their generally accepted unification at the level of kingdoms or subdomains is absent. The most common of the existing options is the division of bacteria into three large groups: ancient bacteria, terrabacteria and hydrobacteria. Representatives of ancient bacteria are hydrogen bacteria (obtain energy by oxidizing hydrogen) and thermotogases (bacteria that live in hot springs). Pterobacteria include cyanobacteria and the causative agent of tuberculosis, and hydrobacteria include spirochetes, chlamydia, and
the causative agents of plague, cholera, and salmonellosis.


ab


Fig. 8.1. Representatives of bacteria ( a ) and archaea ( b )


32. Biodiversity


The systematics of archaea is also not yet sufficiently developed. But scientists distinguish two large groups among them - proteoarchaea and euarchaea. The proteoarchaea group includes the recently discovered (2015) lochiarchaea. They are considered a group that is ancestral to eukaryotes. The term "lochiarchaea" arose due to the fact that these organisms were discovered in water samples collected near the hydrothermal spring "Loki's Castle", located in the Atlantic Ocean. It was not possible to grow these microorganisms in laboratory conditions. Their presence was detected by conducting a metagenomic analysis, which determines the presence of genes from different organisms in the sample under study.


Characteristic features of bacteria and archaea


Characteristic Bacteria Archaea


Number of cells Unicellular, colonial and (sometimes) multicellular Only unicellular


Structure of the cell membrane The membrane is always double-layered, consisting of phospholipids The membrane can be double-layered or single-layered, consisting of glycerol ethers and terpene compounds


Consists of pseudomurein and specific proteins


Cell wall Consists of murein and specific proteins, often has additional layers


Features of the genome Does not contain histones Contains histone-like proteins


Features of flagella Hollow protein cylinders, grow at the tip; rotation occurs due to the use of a proton gradient


Solid protein filaments, grow at the base; rotation occurs due to
the use of ATP energy


Distribution of bacteria and archaea Bacteria occur in all habitats: in water, in soil, in living organisms. They can be in the air, because they are easily transported by its currents (especially in the form of spores). Bacteria live in all types of water bodies - fresh and salty, hot and cold. Archaea were initially discovered in zones of extreme existence: very hot springs (for example, geysers), very cold conditions and in water bodies with very salty, acidic and alkaline environments. But subsequent studies have revealed a significant number of archaea that live in normal conditions. Many representatives of these organisms are inhabitants of the digestive tracts of animals (ruminants, termites, humans, etc.).

Modern views on the system of eukaryotic organisms


9


What domains are distinguished among living organisms? By what features can prokaryotes be distinguished from eukaryotes? What does the science of systematics study? What questions does it solve? What is taxonomy? What modern methods of biotechnology are used to study organisms?


History of eukaryotic systematics The first attempt to classify living beings can be considered the system of Aristotle, who distinguished groups of plants and animals (Fig. 9.1). And the first scientific classification system was the system of K. Linnaeus, in which plants and animals received the status of kingdoms. But even then it became clear that fungi were significantly different from other living organisms, so O. Munchausen singled them out in a separate kingdom. However, he combined them with sponges and corals. This mistake was corrected by N. Necker, who created his own system, where he proposed to single out fungi in a separate kingdom. Unfortunately, the proposals of Munchausen and Necker were long forgotten. After the spread of the evolutionary theory of Charles Darwin, E. Haeckel (Fig. 9.2) proposed the concept of evolutionary taxonomy. According
to this concept, the classification system should reflect

the course of evolution of living organisms. This point of view prevails in science even now. Therefore, modern taxonomies, when creating classifications, necessarily take into account the relationship of different groups of organisms. Scientists in the 19th century first realized that numerous microscopic creatures (bacteria, protozoa, microscopic algae) are difficult to attribute to animals or plants. This resulted in the emergence of a new kingdom Protista in Haeckel's system, which united all unicellular and colonial forms. In the first half of the 20th century, due to the development
of microscopy methods, the difference
between prokaryotes and eukaryotes became clear. In G. Copeland's system, four kingdoms were distinguished: Monera (small organisms), Protoctista (lower eukaryotes), Animals, and Plants. In 1959–1969, the American researcher R. Whittaker (Fig. 9.3) improved this system by separating fungi into a separate kingdom (in G. Copeland's system they were classified as the Protoctista kingdom). This system was the most widespread until the 1980s and 1990s, when new technologies in cytology and molecular biology made it possible to create a modern system of living organisms.

The place of eukaryotes among living organisms Karl Voss, based on the analysis of the rRNA nucleotide sequence and some other molecular characteristics, proposed a new variant of the systematics of living organisms (1985). According to it, organisms were divided into large systematic groups - domains. A domain is a taxon of the highest rank. Cellular life forms are divided into three domains—Bacteria, Archaebacteria, and Eukaryotes. Viruses are distinguished as a separate taxon Vira, which unites noncellular life forms and
corresponds in rank to a domain. This classification most accurately reflects
current ideas about the origin and evolution of the main groups of living organisms (Fig. 9.4). In modern systematics, domains are divided into smaller systematic units—subdomains—which consist of superkingdoms (or groups of kingdoms), and superkingdoms are created by uniting several separate kingdoms of living organisms. Within individual kingdoms, systematic units did not change. You have read about them earlier (see § 3).


The role of symbiogenesis in the evolution of eukaryotes Previously, scientists used signs that depended on environmental conditions and could change rapidly in the classification of eukaryotes. They reflected more the adaptation to certain conditions, rather than the real relatedness of organisms. But often similar signs are also manifested in unrelated organisms, and close "relatives" can differ significantly. New technologies made it possible to find criteria that did not depend on the conditions of existence and more accurately reflected the degree of family ties. Electron microscopy methods made it possible to study the fine structure of cell organelles.

. This allowed us to establish a major role in the evolution of eukaryotes of the phenomenon of symbiogenesis, when a group of organisms arises as a result of the union of several other groups. Thus, previously all algae were part of the kingdom of Plants. But after it was established that their chloroplasts have a different origin (formed through symbiosis between organisms of different systematic groups), they were divided into several different kingdoms. A significant contribution to the elucidation of the role of symbiogenesis in the evolution of eukaryotes belongs to the American researcher Lynn Margulis (Fig. 9.5)..TOPIC 1


Main groups of eukaryotes


10


What groups of eukaryotic organisms do you know? How do plants, animals and fungi differ from each other? Which unicellular organisms are eukaryotes? What are symbiotic organisms? How do autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms differ from each other?


Division of eukaryotes into groups New research technologies that appeared in the second half of the 20th century contributed to the allocation of a much larger number of kingdoms within the group of
eukaryotes. Such a system most accurately reflects the evolutionary relationships
between individual groups of eukaryotes. The greatest contribution to the creation of the new system was made by a group of scientists led by Saina Edla. According to the new system, the domain Eukaryotes is divided into three subdomains, which, in turn, are divided into several groups (superkingdoms). And the superkingdoms are divided into separate kingdoms of living organisms. The three subdomains of eukaryotes are Excavates, Diaphoretics (Bikonts) and Amorphaea (Fig. 10.1). Excavates are exclusively unicellular organisms.

organisms. Excavates often have complex flagellated apparatuses, consisting of 4, 6 or 8 flagella, but among them there are also single- and double-flagellated forms. This group includes pathogens of diseases dangerous to humans. These include, for example, Trichomonas (the causative agent of trichomoniasis), Trypanosoma (the causative agent of sleeping sickness) and Leishmania (the causative agent of leishmaniasis) (Fig. 10.2.). The same group includes euglena, a typical representative of which is Euglena green - an organism that has caused so much controversy about which systematic category to attribute it to. Interesting representatives of excavates are hypermastigines (for example, trichonymph) - unicellular organisms with a large number of flagella. They are symbionts that live in the intestines of termites and cockroaches. It is thanks to them that these insects are able to digest cellulose and other inedible substances. Interestingly, these unicellular eukaryotes also cannot digest cellulose on their own. Symbiotic bacteria that live inside their cells do this for them.


Diaphoretics (Bikonts)
The diaphoretic group is distinguished by the presence of two flagella in most representatives or their ancestors. Diaphoretics can be unicellular, colonial, or multicellular organisms (Fig. 10.3, p. 42).

Diaphoretics live in salt and fresh water bodies and on land. Parasitic representatives can live in the bodies of other living organisms. Most autotrophic eukaryotes belong to the diaphoretic group. However, it also includes heterotrophs, including parasites. This group includes most of the algae divisions (brown,
diatom, golden, etc.). Red and green algae and all terrestrial
plants are also bikonts. Another representative of bikonts are false fungi (oomycota). Actually, false fungi were also once algae. But they lost chlorophyll and were forced to adapt to the same way of feeding as true fungi. That is why they were classified as fungi for a long time. Among diaphoretics there are also forms that are characterized by an animal way of feeding. These include ciliates, foraminifera, radiolaria, and sundews. Unicellular bikonts play an important role in geological processes. For example, diatomite is formed from the shells of diatom algae, and chalk is formed from the remains of coccolithophores. Among them, pathogens of serious diseases are also found. These are, for example, malaria plasmodium (the causative agent of malaria) and toxoplasma (the causative agent of toxoplasmosis).

AmorphaeaThe Amorphaea group consists of unicellular, colonial and multicellular organisms. Among them, organisms capable of amoeboid movement with a change in cell shape are often found. The cells of the vast majority of Amorpheans have only one flagellum. But, as researchers have found out, this option is not the original: the most primitive Amorpheans have two flagella. Amorpheans live in salt and fresh water bodies and on land. Only among their representatives are there flying organisms. Most are heterotrophs (including parasites), but there are also those that, thanks to symbiosis, have acquired the ability to autotrophic nutrition. Amorpheans include true slime molds, true fungi, and multicellular animals. In terms of the number of species, this group is the largest among eukaryotes. Unicellular forms in Amorpheans are represented by amoebae, collared flagellates, yeasts, and other groups (Fig. 10.4). Unicellular amorpheas can be causative agents of diseases such as amoebic dysentery (dysenteric amoeba) and candidiasis (yeast).


The mass of symbiotic unicellular organisms that live in the intestines of termites and cockroaches can be half of their body mass. TOPIC 1


Autotrophic eukaryotes


11


How do autotrophs feed? How do plants differ from animals? What is osmosis? What plants do humans use in agriculture?


Systematic position of autotrophic eukaryotes
You already know that autotrophic eukaryotes form organic substances from inorganic ones through the process of photosynthesis, which occurs in the chloroplasts of their cells. For a long time, scientists called all such organisms plants and allocated them to a separate kingdom. But more detailed studies have found that the chloroplasts of eukaryotes arose by endosymbiosis (settling inside the cell of a unicellular photosynthetic organism). In addition, it turned out that eukaryotes received chloroplasts more than once and from different groups of organisms during evolution: first from cyanobacteria, and then from other eukaryotes. Therefore, in modern systematics, different groups of autotrophic eukaryotes belong to different kingdoms, superkingdoms and subdomains (Fig. 11.1). The term “plants” is not currently used to denote a separate systematic unit, but it is usually used to refer to the kingdom Green plants ( Viridiplantae ), which includes green algae and higher plants (mosses, ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms, etc.). Features of the structure and vital activity of plants that

was studied in the previous parts of the biology course, it was shown specifically in organisms of this group. The term "algae" was previously used to designate all photosynthetic eukaryotes, except for higher plants. In modern systematics, it is not used separately, but it remained in the names of some systematic groups (Brown algae, Red algae, Green algae, etc.).


Features of the structure and vital activity of autotrophs Autotrophic eukaryotes are distinguished by a great diversity of body structures. Among them are organisms whose body is represented by layers (not divided into organs, for example, in algae), and there are organisms that have a complex multicellular structure, with the division of the body into tissues and organs (for example, in flowers). Among autotrophs there are unicellular, colonial and
multicellular organisms. A very characteristic feature of autotrophic eukaryotes
is that they obtain the substances they need from the environment, absorbing them with the surface of their body. Therefore, they can absorb only those substances that are in dissolved form. To designate these organisms, the term osmotrophs is used.

Representatives of autotrophic eukaryotes The largest number of autotrophic eukaryotes belongs to two superkingdoms from the domain Diaphoretics - Archaeplastida and SAR. Archaeplastida (Archaeplastida) unite photosynthetic eukaryotes, whose plastids arose as a result of symbiosis with cyanobacteria. Thanks to this, archaeplastida got their name, which in translation from ancient Greek means "those containing ancient plastids".

kingdoms that are part of it ( Stramenopiles , Alveolata , Rhizaria ). Not all representatives of this group belong to autotrophic organisms.

Systematic position of true fungi and fungus-like organisms
Scientists have long combined true fungi and fungus-like
organisms into one kingdom. Modern research methods have made it possible to establish that the similarity of these organisms is associated with adaptation to a similar lifestyle, but they have different origins. Therefore, now different groups of true fungi and fungus-like organisms are attributed to different subdomains of eukaryotes (Fig. 12.1). The term "fungi" is not currently used to denote a separate systematic category, but it is usually called the kingdom True fungi. And mushroom-like organisms include false fungi and several groups of slime molds. Modern scientists distinguish true fungi into a separate kingdom in the subdomain Amorphea. In terms of the number of species, true fungi are second only to animals and surpass all other groups of eukaryotes. False fungi are representatives of diaphoretics. The ancestors of false fungi were algae that lost the ability to synthesize chlorophyll.

Fig. 12.1. Systematic position of fungi and fungus-like organisms


48. Biodiversity


True slime molds, like true fungi, are representatives of the Amorphaea, but belong to a different kingdom than true fungi. Other groups of slime molds are classified as excavates (false slime molds, or acrasias) and diaphoretics (parasitic slime molds, or plasmodia aphorids).


Features of the structure and vital activity of fungi and fungus-like organisms A characteristic feature of all fungi and fungus-like organisms is that they obtain the substances they need from the environment
, absorbing them with the surface of their body. That is, like autotrophic
eukaryotes, fungi and fungus-like organisms are osmotrophs. This method of nutrition is facilitated by the fact that their body has the shape of a mycelium. Mycelium is a giant branched structure, the individual filamentous processes of which are called hyphae. But in addition to water and minerals, these organisms also have to absorb organic substances from the external environment, because they are all heterotrophs and are not able to independently synthesize organic substances from inorganic ones. Most fungi have a mycelial structure, but typical unicellular forms are also found (for example, yeast). Representatives of different groups of slime molds are able to form plasmodia (giant motile multinucleate cells) or pseudoplasmodia (clusters of individual cells that can move in concert) (Fig. 12.2). Another characteristic feature of fungi is the presence of a cell wall in their cells. It is formed by various polysaccharides. For example, in most true fungi it contains beta-glucans and chitin, but in some cases chitin is almost absent (yeast) or replaced by chitosan (mucor). In false fungi, the cell wall is formed from cellulose.

Systematic position of animals Real animals are representatives of the Amorphaea. The kingdom Real animals unites multicellular animals, the unicellular ancestors of these animals and their closest relatives. Multicellular animals, which are usually called simply animals, form a separate subkingdom in this kingdom (Fig. 13.1). In terms of the number of species, true animals are the largest group of living organisms.


Features of the structure and vital activity of animals
Like fungi, animals are heterotrophic organisms. A characteristic
feature of multicellular animals is that they obtain the substances they need with food, which they then digest. The term phagotrophs is used to designate such organisms.

The body shape of animals is different. Most often it is bilateral, that is, the body has one axis of symmetry. It can distinguish
the right and left sides and the front and rear ends of the body.
Many animals have radial symmetry of the body, when several axes of symmetry can be drawn through it. The body shape can also be irregular, when no axis of symmetry can be drawn through it (Fig. 13.2). Animals have inhabited all possible habitats. They can be found in salt and fresh water bodies, on land and underground. Many representatives of this group are capable of flight. Animals can be predators, feed on plants or consume dead organic matter. These organisms are one of the peaks of the evolution of life on our planet.
