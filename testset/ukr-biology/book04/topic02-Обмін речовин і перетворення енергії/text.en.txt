Organic substances of living organisms


14


What groups are the substances of living organisms divided into? How do inorganic substances differ from organic substances? What groups of organic substances exist? What monomers do polymeric organic substances consist of?


The main groups of organic substances If we determine the content of various substances in living organisms, then water is the most abundant in them. This is understandable, because water forms the basis of the internal environment of organisms. But if we do not take water into account, then the bulk of the body mass will be organic substances. As you already know, the main organic substances of living organisms are proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids. These substances are the basis of living cells (including all organelles). Without them, the existence of metabolic processes and the implementation of biochemical reactions at high speed is impossible. All the fundamental properties of living things are manifested precisely thanks to these substances. Organic substances form not only the structures of living cells, but also important extracellular structures. For example, the carbohydrate chitin is the basis of the external integuments of arthropods, and the proteins keratin form hair, nails, rhinoceros horns, bird feathers, etc.


ProteinsProteins are large organic molecules, biopolymers. The monomers of proteins are amino acids. A protein is a linear polymer consisting of a large number of amino acids linked into a chain and folded in space in a certain way. Each protein molecule has its own unique, inherent spatial three-dimensional structure. And only in this form can it normally perform its unique functions.

Proteins can be divided into two large groups according to their composition - simple and complex. Simple proteins include only amino acids. Complex proteins, in addition to amino acid residues,
also contain a non-protein part - a prosthetic
group. Such a group can be both an organic and an inorganic molecule. According to the shape of the molecule, proteins can also be divided into two large groups - globular and fibrillar. Globular protein molecules have the appearance of lumps, and fibrillar protein molecules - threads. There are a lot of proteins in living organisms, and they perform various functions in them. Almost all functions of living organisms are to one degree or another related to the work of certain groups of proteins. With the help of proteins, organisms build their structures, carry out vital processes and reproduce themselves. The main functions of proteins are catalytic, structural, regulatory, signaling, transport, protective, motor, storage and toxic.

Carbohydrates


Carbohydrates are complex organic compounds, the molecules of which include several groups: hydroxyl (–OH), carboxyl (–COOH) or carbonyl (–COH). The general formula of carbohydrates is C n (H 2 O) m , where n and m are natural numbers. A significant part of carbohydrates are biopolymers (starch, cellulose, glycogen). Such biopolymers are called polysaccharides. Their monomers are molecules of small carbohydrates (for example, glucose), which are called monosaccharides. Such carbohydrates contain a small
number of carbon atoms (from 3 to 7 atoms
in a molecule). In living organisms, monosaccharides can be contained as separate substances, and not only as part of polysaccharides, or combine in pairs, forming disaccharides (Fig. 14.1). Fig. 14.1. Carbohydrate Molecules

Lipids
Lipids are a group of substances that are united primarily not by chemical structure, but by physical properties. They are all insoluble in water, oily or fatty substances. The most common lipids are fats and oils (esters of a trihydric alcohol), waxes (esters of a monohydric alcohol) and steroids (aromatic compounds) (Fig. 14.2). The composition of most lipids is the polyhydric alcohol glycerol (C 3 H 5 (OH) 3 ) and fatty acids. In many cases, only two fatty acid molecules are attached to the glycerol molecule. And the third OH-group interacts with the orthophosphoric acid molecule (such compounds are called phospholipids). Glycerol is absent in waxes and steroids. Waxes are compounds of fatty acids with other alcohols that have long molecules and only one OH-group. Therefore, each wax molecule contains only one fatty acid molecule and one alcohol molecule. Steroids do not contain either fatty acids or alcohols. They are polymers of the hydrocarbon isoprene (C 5 H 8 ). Their skeleton of carbon atoms forms several ring structures combined into a single whole. The main functions of lipids in living organisms are structural, protective, regulatory, reserve, plastic and energy. Two

Nucleic acids Nucleic acid molecules are large organic
molecules - biopolymers, the monomers

They differ in their composition and structural features (Fig. 14.3). The nucleotides of DNA include an orthophosphate acid residue, a deoxyribonucleic acid monosaccharide, and a phospholipid.

DNA molecules themselves usually consist of two chains of nucleotides, which are connected to each other by hydrogen bonds. The structure of the RNA molecule is similar to the structure of the DNA molecule, but RNA nucleotides contain the monosaccharide ribose instead of deoxyribose, and uracil instead of thymine. In addition, the RNA molecule usually consists of a single chain of nucleotides, the various fragments of which form hydrogen bonds with each other. The main function of nucleic acids is to work with hereditary information, namely: its storage, transmission and implementation. Biological role of organic substances

Metabolism and energy in biological systems


15


What is a system? What is a closed system? What is an open system? Are there open inorganic systems? Are all organic systems open? What substances do organisms obtain from the environment and secrete into it?


Metabolism and energy Living organisms in general and their cells in particular are biological systems, the elements of which are united by a common metabolism and energy conversion. Metabolism is a set of chemical reactions that occur in organisms and their cells and are necessary to maintain their vital activity. Metabolism can be conditionally divided into two stages - exchange with the environment and internal metabolism. Energy exchange is also closely related to metabolism. During metabolic reactions, energy can be spent or stored by the organism for subsequent use. It is stored in the form of various chemical compounds, such as ATP, glycogen, starch, lipids, etc. Part of the energy is not used by the body and is released into the environment in the form of heat.


Metabolism Metabolism is defined as a regular order of transformation of substances and energy in an individual cell and the organism as a whole, aimed at the growth, vital activity and self-reproduction of both individual cells and the entire organism as a whole. Metabolism consists of two types of metabolism, or interconnected complexes of reactions. These are reactions of plastic (anabolism) and energy (catabolism) metabolism. As a result of reactions of plastic metabolism, complex organic compounds are formed (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, etc.). They are synthesized by the body from simpler compounds (proteins from amino acids, carbohydrates from monosaccharides, etc.). To carry out these reactions, the body's cells spend energy. During reactions of energy metabolism, complex organic substances
are converted into simple organic or inorganic substances.
For example, glucose is first converted to pyruvate, and pyruvate


66. Metabolism and energy conversion


in subsequent processes into water and carbon dioxide. As a result of these reactions, the body's cells store energy in the form of certain chemical compounds (ATP, glycogen, starch, etc.). It is this energy that is used to carry out plastic metabolism reactions. Part of the energy of the reactions is not stored, but is released in the form of heat. This heat is a by-product of metabolic reactions, but it can also be used by living organisms in their vital activity.


Metabolic intensity Metabolism occurs in all living organisms. But its intensity can change under certain conditions. In some cases, it can increase, and in some, it can decrease. The main reasons for increasing or decreasing the intensity of metabolism are an increase or decrease in the temperature of the environment, the appearance or disappearance of danger, disease, the action of certain environmental factors, etc. High metabolic intensity is the cause of increased heat release (as a by-product of metabolic reactions). This effect is used, for example, by bees, which can warm themselves in the cold season by actively working their wing muscles. Chills in humans that occur when they freeze are also a manifestation of this phenomenon. In this case, the muscles of the body often contract and relax, contributing to the production of additional heat. A decrease in the intensity of metabolism allows living organisms to significantly "save" their resources. In this way, they can survive adverse conditions that periodically arise in the ecosystem. An example of this is, for example, the phenomenon of animal hibernation and the dormancy of plant seeds in winter. TOPIC 2


Cell structures that provide metabolic processes


16


What organelles are in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells? What groups are cell organelles divided into? What structural features do cell membranes have? What functions do they perform?


Structural support for metabolism A significant part of metabolic processes occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. But in many cases, special structures are required for this. These structures are the organelles of the cell. Organelles are divided into two large groups - membranous and non-membranous. Membranous organelles are separated from other parts of the cell by plasma membranes that cover them. There can be one of these membranes (in single-membrane organelles) or two (in double-membrane organelles). Although all cell structures are involved in metabolic processes to one degree or another, they can be distinguished by their degree of importance. The most important include ribosomes (non-membrane organelles), the nucleus, mitochondria and plastids (double-membrane), and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex (single-membrane).

Ribosomes synthesize proteins from amino acids. They have a complex shape and consist of two parts (subunits) - large and small - which can disintegrate and reunite. The subunits include RNA and protein molecules (Fig. 16.1). Ribosomes are located in the cytoplasm of cells, on the endoplasmic reticulum, in mitochondria and plastids. They are divided into two types: prokaryotic (smaller in size) and eukaryotic (larger). Prokaryotic ribosomes are found in prokaryotic cells, as well as in mitochondria

and plastids. And eukaryotic ribosomes are found in eukaryotic cells, in the cytoplasm and on the endoplasmic reticulum.


Nucleus


Chromatin Nuclear pores


Fig. 16.2. Structure of the nucleus Nucleus


The nucleus is responsible for the preservation, reproduction and implementation of hereditary information. It controls all processes in the cell. The nuclear membrane is permeated with pores in many places. A large number of such pores in the membrane allows for easy exchange of information between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Karyoplasm, chromatin and nucleolus are located throughout the nucleus. Karyoplasm is a translucent
internal environment in which
all biochemical reactions take place (Fig. 16.2).

Mitochondria Mitochondria produce energy as a result of biological oxidation processes. The inner membrane of mitochondria forms outgrowths - cristae. This structure of the membrane allows it to accommodate many protein complexes that carry out biological oxidation processes. The outer membrane is smooth. The internal environment of mitochondria is called the matrix. They contain
prokaryotic-type ribosomes. The matrix contains
circular molecules of mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 16.3).

Plastids Plastids carry out the process of photosynthesis. They synthesize the proteins necessary for this process. They can provide coloration of plant organs and accumulate reserve substances. The inner membrane of plastids can form structures separated from it in the form of flattened sacs - thylakoids (Fig. 16.4). This structure of the membrane allows

to place many protein complexes that carry out the processes of photosynthesis. The outer membrane is smooth. The internal environment of plastids is called stroma. It contains circular DNA molecules. Plastids contain prokaryotic ribosomes. They are distinguished by color: green (chloroplasts), yellow-orange or red (chromoplasts) and discolored (leucoplasts).


Endoplasmic reticulum There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - agranular (smooth) and granular (rough). Agranular endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes lipids and some polysaccharides. The main function of the granular endoplasmic reticulum is protein synthesis. In addition, it participates in the transport of proteins in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum consists of a system of small vacuoles
and tubules that are interconnected. Ribosomes are located on the membranes of the granular endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 16.5).


Golgi complex This structure is responsible for the modification of proteins, the packaging of synthesized products into granules, the synthesis of some polysaccharides, the formation of the cell membrane, and the transport of substances synthesized in the cell outside its boundaries. The Golgi complex is formed by a system of dictyosomes. They look like columns of 5–20 flat membrane sacs (cisterns), which are distributed in the cytoplasm separately or are connected into one structure (Fig. 16.6). The transport of substances between the EPS, the Golgi complex, and other organelles is carried out mainly by means of vesicles — small bubbles that are separated from the cytosol by a membrane

by the cell membrane. Vesicles can either fuse with the cisternae of the Golgi complex or separate from them.

Fig. 16.7. Transport of metabolic products along the microtubules of the cytoskeleton


Cytoplasm The structures of the cytoplasm of cells and skin play a very important role in metabolic processes. Of particular importance are the cytosol and the cytoskeleton. The cytosol (or hyaloplasm) is a semi-liquid structure, the density of which can vary within quite wide limits depending on the needs of the cell. It is the largest component of the cytoplasm by volume and forms the environment in which biochemical reactions occur. It is in the cytosol, for example, that the reactions of the glycolysis process take place. The cytosol also plays a significant role in the processes of protein synthesis. For example, in mammals, approximately half of the cell's proteins are synthesized in the cytosol. Another important function of this structure is the transmission of signals from the external environment to the cell nucleus and back. The cytoskeleton performs an important transport function in metabolic processes. With the help of its microtubules, metabolic products, for example, are moved inside the cell (Fig. 16.7). To do this, they are packed into small lipid vesicles (vesicles) and, with the help of carrier proteins, move along microtubules using ATP energy..TOPIC 2


Cellular respiration


17


As a result of what type of metabolism do living organisms produce energy for their needs? What is oxidation? Where can oxidation processes occur in the cell? What functions do ATP molecules perform in the cell? What is a macroergic bond? What is acetyl-CoA
(acetyl-coenzyme A)?


Cellular respirationCellular respiration is the set of processes by which a cell obtains energy through the oxidation of organic substances. It can occur both in the absence and presence of oxygen. Oxidation reactions occur in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of cells. The result of cellular respiration is the storage of energy by the cell in the form of macroergic bonds of ATP molecules. In the process of cellular respiration, two stages are distinguished: anaerobic (first) and aerobic (second) (Fig. 17.1). At the anaerobic stage, complex organic substances are broken down into simpler ones. And at the aerobic stage, these simpler substances are broken down into carbon dioxide and water. The aerobic stage may not always occur and not in all living organisms (it does not occur, for example, in anaerobes).


The first stage of cellular respiration The first stage of cellular respiration is anaerobic. It occurs in the cytosol of cells. Its basis is the process of glycolysis. Glycolysis is a biochemical process that usually occurs in all cells of the body and is one of the sources of ATP supply for the cell. As a result of glycolysis, two molecules of pyruvate (pyruvic acid) and two molecules of ATP are formed from one molecule of glucose:


C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2C 3 H 4 O 3 + 2H 2 O + 2ATP Glucose Pyruvate


If the cell is unable to carry out the second stage of cellular respiration (for example, due to a lack of oxygen), then the first stage

Compounds are formed that are a source of protons and electrons for the oxidation process and CO 2 molecules


Fig. 17.1. The scheme of the cellular respiration process


is completed by the fermentation process, in which intermediate compounds are converted into certain organic substances.
Fermentation is the process of oxidation of carbohydrates, which occurs
without the participation of oxygen and allows cells to obtain energy in the form of ATP molecules. The first stage of fermentation is glycolysis. And in the next stage of fermentation, depending on its type, pyruvate is converted into other substances. These substances are excreted from the cell as metabolic products that are no longer needed. As a result of alcoholic fermentation, molecules of ethyl alcohol, water and carbon dioxide are formed, lactic acid - lactic acid, acetic acid - acetic acid (Fig. 17.2). There are other types of fermentation.

Fig. 17.3. Scheme of stages of cellular respiration


The second stage of cellular respiration This is the oxygen stage of the breakdown of simple organic substances that were formed from more complex ones during the anaerobic stage of cellular respiration or as a result of other biochemical reactions. As a result of the first stage of cellular respiration, which occurs in the cytosol, as you already know, pyruvate (pyruvic acid) is formed. During the second stage of cellular respiration, pyruvate is transported from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix, where it first undergoes oxidative decarboxylation (with conversion to acetyl-CoA), and then its further oxidation to carbon dioxide and water (Fig. 17.3). The key link in the cellular respiration process, which occurs during its second stage, is the Krebs cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle). It is in the reactions of this cycle that compounds are formed that are a source of protons and electrons for the oxidation process. These compounds enter the respiratory chain (a complex complex of proteins built into the inner membrane of mitochondria), where the oxidation process is completed. Not only the products of the first stage of cellular respiration can enter the Krebs cycle, but also substances from other biochemical processes (for example, products of beta-oxidation of fatty acids). Compounds formed in the reactions of the Krebs cycle can be used not only to obtain energy. If necessary, they can enter other metabolic processes (for example, as
starting materials in the processes of synthesis of carbohydrates, fats and proteins).


74. Metabolism and energy conversion


Efficiency of the cellular respiration process Cellular respiration is an extremely efficient process. Even during its first stage — glycolysis — from one glucose molecule, the cell receives 2 ATP molecules, and at the following stages of cellular respiration, 36 more molecules are added to these molecules. The general formula of biological oxidation:


C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + 38ATP


Oxidation occurs in several stages, each of which releases energy. Part of the energy is released in the form of heat (45%) and can be used to maintain the optimal body temperature, and part (55%) is stored in ATP. Biological oxidation is the most effective mechanism of living organisms for providing their cells with energy.


The mass of all ATP molecules that are formed in the cells of the human body per day is equal to the mass of the person himself.


The ancestor of all eukaryotes had mitochondria, lived in an oxygen environment, and both stages of the cellular respiration process took place in his cell. Some modern eukaryotes do not have mitochondria, so the second stage of cellular respiration does not occur in their cells. They lost their mitochondria in the process of adapting to anaerobic living conditions. TOPIC 2


Features of metabolism in autotrophic
and heterotrophic organisms


18


Which organisms are heterotrophic and which are autotrophic? Which organisms can carry out photosynthesis and which can carry out chemosynthesis? What substances do organisms absorb and release during respiration and photosynthesis?


Similarity of metabolic processes in different organisms All living organisms need organic substances and energy for their growth, development and reproduction. The main source of energy for all organisms is the oxidation of organic molecules, which can occur both with and without oxygen. As you already know, organisms can be divided into two large groups according to the method of obtaining organic substances - heterotrophic (use ready-made organic substances) and autotrophic (synthesize organic substances from inorganic). The main biochemical processes that any living organism needs to ensure its vital activity are the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids, the processes of cellular respiration, in particular the reactions of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, the formation and breakdown of lipid and carbohydrate molecules, etc. In the cells of both autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, all these processes occur in the same or almost the same way, using the same enzyme complexes. And the regulatory processes in their cells are also very similar. And although they are not absolutely identical, the sequence of the main reactions is the same in all cases.


Metabolism in heterotrophs As you have already learned earlier, heterotrophic organisms cannot form organic substances from inorganic ones. They receive them from other living organisms in the form of food that they consume. They simply deliver small
organic molecules (amino acids, monosaccharides, fatty acids,
nucleotides) to their cells and use them there, while large molecules (proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids) are first broken down into small ones, and then “assemble” from them the large molecules that they need.


76. Metabolism and energy conversion


For example, animals and fungi break down proteins (which are biopolymers) to amino acids (their monomers). Then they assemble their own proteins from these amino acids. Heterotrophic organisms can synthesize some of the amino acids themselves. To do this, they use the energy obtained during the oxidation of consumed organic compounds. But some amino acids enter their bodies only with food. Such amino acids are called essential. In addition to amino acids, vitamins are also essential for heterotrophic organisms — compounds that are required in very small quantities for metabolic processes.


Metabolism in autotrophs Autotrophic organisms do not obtain organic substances from the external environment and must produce them independently. Therefore, it makes no sense to talk about essential amino acids and vitamins for plants. Autotrophs obtain the organic substances they need from inorganic ones, using energy that can come from physical or chemical sources. The physical source of energy is solar radiation. Those organisms that use it to synthesize organic substances are called photoautotrophs (phototrophs). And the actual process of forming organic substances using solar energy is photosynthesis. Chemical energy sources are redox chemical reactions that occur in the cells of the organism. Organisms that use them are called chemoautotrophs (chemotrophs), and the process itself is chemosynthesis.

Formation of organic substances


Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the process of forming organic substances from inorganic substances by living organisms using light energy (Fig. 18.1). Photosynthesis is carried out by both unicellular living organisms (cyanobacteria and algae) and multicellular (green algae and land plants). As a result of photosynthesis, glucose is formed from carbon dioxide and water using solar energy:

The role of enzymes in ensuring metabolic processes


19


What functions do proteins perform? What are catalysis and catalysts? What catalysts do living organisms use? How do animals and fungi feed?


Structure and functions of enzymes Enzymes are large organic molecules that perform the function of catalysis, that is, they change the rate of chemical reactions. Traditionally, only protein molecules were called enzymes. But now enzymes also include ribozymes (RNA molecules) and complexes consisting of protein and RNA molecules. These compounds also perform catalysis very effectively (for example, during the formation of peptide bonds by the ribosome). In cells, enzymes are found both in the cytoplasm and inside various organelles or on cell membranes. Often, cells can secrete enzymes to the outside to carry out processes outside the cell (for example, digestion processes). By their structure, enzymes are large organic molecules that have a complex spatial structure (unique for each enzyme). This structure includes parts that form areas that carry out the catalysis process, and there are regulatory areas. Enzymes are classified according to the types of reactions they catalyze. In living organisms, a large number of reactions occur simultaneously at a relatively stable temperature and pH of the environment. Without the participation of enzymes, these reactions would occur extremely slowly, and in many cases would not be able to occur at all. For example, the enzyme catalase breaks down hydrogen peroxide, which is poisonous to human cells,
into water and oxygen. One
molecule of catalase is enough to break down 10,000 molecules of hydrogen peroxide in one second. The most common enzyme on our planet is ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (abbreviated as RuBisCo), which catalyzes the CO2 fixation reaction in the Calvin cycle, which occurs during the dark phase of photosynthesis. The total mass of this enzyme in all photosynthetic organisms on our planet is 40 billion tons.

Ligases Reactions of joining two molecules with the formation of a new bond (usually using ATP energy)


Mechanism of enzyme operation The mechanism of enzyme operation is conveniently considered on the example of a protein enzyme. Like any other protein, such an enzyme is a chain of amino acids that is folded in space in a certain way. The folding of the chain occurs so that the amino acid radicals form a special structure - the active center of the enzyme. It is in this center that reactions occur. The amino acid radicals are arranged in space in a certain way
relative to each other. They differ in their properties, and their
joint action creates conditions in which the corresponding reaction occurs much faster than under normal conditions. Substances that participate in reactions in the active centers of enzymes are called substrates (Fig. 19.1).

81. TOPIC 2


In some cases, a non-protein component is also required for the enzyme to work. This compound (called a cofactor) joins the enzyme and also participates in the process of catalyzing the reaction. Vitamins are often cofactors of enzymes. Regulation of the work of enzymes can be carried out using the regulatory sites of their molecules. Molecules
of regulatory substances are attached to these sites. After this, the spatial structure of
the enzyme molecule changes and, accordingly, the speed of its work changes.


The action of enzymes outside cells Living organisms use enzymes not only in their cells. They often secrete them into the extracellular space. Usually, this is done by osmotrophs (organisms that feed on dissolved organic substances) (Fig. 19.2). But there are other groups of organisms that also use enzymes in this way.


Use of enzymes by organisms outside cells


Group of organisms How enzymes are used outside cells Examples


Rotting meat, decomposition of fallen leaves


Fungi Destruction of wood affected by fungi, decomposition of bread covered with mold


Bacteria Release enzymes into the environment to break down organic substances


In sundews and Nepenthes digestion of
caught animals


Insectivorous plants Release enzymes into traps with caught animals to break down organic substances


Animals Release enzymes into body cavities for cavity digestion or into the body of prey for external digestion


In mammals - digestion processes in the stomach and intestines, in spiders - external digestion after the introduction of poison into prey, in snakes - decomposition of prey tissues under the action of poison enzymes


In some cases, the functions of enzymes released into organisms may change in the process of evolution. For example, in the ancestors of snakes, the enzyme phospholipase A2 was a common digestive enzyme. Its introduction into the victim's body made the digestion process faster, because in the intestines the enzymes acted on the victim's body both from the outside and from the inside. But as a result of duplication and subsequent mutations, this enzyme acquired toxic properties. It became one of the most important components of snake venom and now kills victims by destroying the membranes of their cells.

The ability of living organisms to secrete enzymes outside the cell is widely used in modern biotechnology. For example, bacteria, into whose genome the necessary genes are transplanted, secrete synthesized enzymes from their cells. And these enzymes can already be easily separated from cells and used for the production of products (for example, medicines or washing powders).


The ancestor of placental mammals, who lived 100 million years ago, fed mainly on insects and had 5 chitinases genes - enzymes that break down chitin in the digestive system. Then its descendants evolved and significantly changed their diet. Therefore, in many cases, chitinase genes mutated and stopped working, turning into pseudogenes. They can still be found in the genomes of mammals..TOPIC 2


Vitamins, their role in metabolism


20


What substances are needed for the vital activity of the organism? What are coenzymes? Why can some enzymes not perform their functions without the addition of a coenzyme?


Discovery of vitamins
For a long time, the causes of diseases such as scurvy and rickets were unknown. Even after the discovery of microorganisms that were pathogens, it was not possible to establish the cause of these diseases. But it has long been noticed that nutrition affects the course of these diseases. That is why, for example, the Dutch introduced citrus fruits into the diet of their sailors back in the 17th century. The foundations of the theory of vitamins were laid by M. I. Lunin (Fig. 20.1). He conducted experiments with white mice: he fed one group with an artificial mixture, and the other with milk. The first group of mice died, while the rest developed normally. The scientist concluded that milk contains additional nutritional factors, which were later called vitamins.


Variety of vitamins


Fig. 20.1. Nikolay Ivanovich Lunin (1854–1937) — Doctor of Medicine, pediatrician, author of the theory of vitamins


Vitamins include organic substances of different composition and properties, which are needed by the body in small quantities, but without which its vital activity is impossible. Vitamins are divided into two large groups based on their properties — water-soluble and fat-soluble (Fig. 20.2). This classification is the most rational from a practical point of view. Water-soluble vitamins, in case of excessive intake into the body, can be relatively easily excreted through the kidneys. Accordingly, it is easier for the body to maintain the concentration of these substances at the required level than fat-soluble ones.


84. Metabolism and energy conversion


Vitamins


Fat-soluble A, D, E, K


Water-soluble C, PP, B 1 , B 12 , B 6 , B 2


Fig. 20.2. Classification of vitamins


Fat-soluble vitamins are much more difficult to remove from the body. Therefore, if they enter the body excessively, they can cause metabolic disorders. It should be noted that problems with vitamins in the body can arise not only due to their insufficient or excessive intake. In some cases, the body becomes unable to absorb vitamins (so-called endogenous hypovitaminosis). This can occur due to increased acidity of gastric juice, impaired formation of transport proteins, impaired bile secretion, etc. Vitamin metabolism can be associated with the metabolism of minerals or other vitamins. For example, the absorption of vitamins A, C, E and K is positively affected by the presence of Selenium ions. And vitamin E and Manganese ions promote the absorption of vitamin C. Conversely, vitamin C can interfere with the absorption of vitamin B 12.


Vitamins in metabolismVitamins are a fairly large group of substances (the human body requires at least 13 vitamins), and they perform various functions in the body's metabolic processes. Most vitamins are part of enzymes - large organic molecules (mainly proteins) that are able to change the speed of biochemical reactions occurring in cells. Usually, vitamins in enzymes play the role of prosthetic groups - certain groups of atoms that are part of the active center of the enzyme and without which its functioning is impossible. But they also perform other functions..TOPIC 2


Mineral substances. Water


21


What substances are in the composition of living organisms? What is the significance of water for living organisms? What features of water have made it a universal solvent in the cells of living organisms? What are macro- and microelements?


What are minerals? Minerals in the body are individual low-molecular microelements, salts and salt ions that support the normal functioning of the body. They are part of the structural elements of all cells and tissues and participate in all biochemical processes that occur in the body. Minerals can be in the body both in dissolved form (in the form of ions) and in undissolved form.


The most common minerals
in the human body


Substances Functions in the body Properties


Sodium and Potassium Salts Ensure the functioning of neurons, create a potential difference on cell membranes Soluble


Calcium Salts Participate in the processes of muscle contraction


Soluble Calcium and Phosphorus Salts Form the mineral basis of bones


Poorly soluble Chloric acid Participates in the process of digestion in the stomach Soluble Iron


ions in the composition of heme Ensure the transport of oxygen in the composition of hemoglobin Are part of
an insoluble compound


Features of mineral metabolism in humans Minerals enter the human body mainly with food and water, therefore they are indispensable components of nutrition. This is how compounds of Iron, Calcium, Sodium, Potassium enter the body. But in some cases the body can synthesize them independently (for example, stomach cells synthesize hydrochloric acid).


86. Metabolism and energy conversion


The metabolism of mineral substances in the body is precisely balanced by the amount of salts excreted from the body. Excess salts are removed with urine and sweat. In addition, minerals can also be excreted through the intestines. And in the case of cholera, the loss of minerals and water through the intestines is so great that it becomes one of the causes of a person's death from this disease. The composition of mineral substances in the cells of organisms (including humans) is constant, so even small deviations can cause the body to stop its normal vital activity.


Violations of mineral metabolism in the human body The causes of mineral metabolism disorders are quite diverse. They can be associated both with the action of external factors and with disorders in the body itself. Often, the same symptoms can occur due to different reasons.


Consequences of some disorders of mineral metabolism


Disorders
Symptoms
Causes


Disorders of calcium metabolism Development of osteoporosis, increased bone fragility


Insufficient estrogen production, increased level of calcium needs during pregnancy, lack of calcium compounds in the diet, abuse of hormonal drugs, kidney diseases, etc.


Iodine deficiency Iodine deficiency, development of goiter, thyroid dysfunction, growth retardation, weakened immunity, cretinism


Low iodine content in the diet, thyroid disease, selenium deficiency in the diet, radioactive radiation, excessive alcohol consumption and smoking, hormonal diseases


Disorders of iron metabolism Anemia, dry skin and hair, brittle nails, pale skin


Lack of iron compounds in the diet, large blood loss, impaired processes of assimilation of iron compounds by the body, hereditary diseases


Lack of manganese compounds in the diet, impaired processes of assimilation of manganese compounds body


Manganese deficiency Growth retardation, underdevelopment of the gonads, blood clotting disorders, nervous system disorders, convulsions


Excess of Manganese compounds in the diet, inhalation of dust with a high content of Manganese while working in mines


Excess of Manganese Damage to mitochondria in cells, nervous system disorders, mental disorders, gonadal function disorders


87. TOPIC 2


The causes of mineral metabolism disorders in the human body can be: insufficient or excessive intake of minerals into the body; some diseases (hormonal, hereditary, etc.); use of large amounts or improper use of certain medications; the effect of toxic substances of natural or artificial origin (during volcanic eruptions, industrial pollution, etc.); disorders in the metabolism of some minerals can cause disorders in the metabolism of others. The consequence of mineral metabolism disorders in humans is a variety of diseases. They can have serious consequences for human health and pose a threat to their life.

Problems of mineral metabolism in animals and plants
Problems of mineral metabolism arise not only
in humans, but also in other living organisms. In the organisms of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria, the metabolism of mineral substances can also be disturbed in case of insufficient or excessive intake. People most often encounter this problem when growing farm animals and plants and keeping pets. For example, in animals, the skeleton and protective structures on the surface of the body are often built on the basis of mineral substances. Therefore, a violation of their metabolism is the cause of certain diseases (rickets, osteoporosis, etc.). For plants, very important mineral substances are compounds of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Sulfur, Potassium. A lack of any of these substances leads to inhibition of plant growth (Fig. 21.1). But their excess can also negatively affect their development. Drinking water and its quality


Any living organism, including the human body, needs a constant supply of water. Some of it enters the human body as part of food products Fig. 21.1. Consequences of a lack of certain minerals in plants


88. Metabolism and energy conversion


, but its main amount is in the form of drinking water. Therefore, it is not surprising that the composition of water significantly affects the state of human health. Drinking water contains many different components, albeit in small quantities: dissolved mineral and organic substances, very small particles of insoluble substances, microorganisms. Some
of them can be beneficial to the body, others - harmful. In both
cases, this is determined by the amount of the component. Yes, mineral water can be used for treatment, and in this case its amount and mode of intake are important. To determine the quality of drinking water, it is evaluated according to many parameters (mineralization, hardness, pH, microbiological state, etc.). An important indicator is the MPC - the maximum permissible concentration of a certain substance. For each substance, its own MPC value is determined, and if it exceeds the normal value, then the water is harmful to human health. For example, water with a low mineral content can cause diseases of the teeth, digestive and excretory systems, etc. One of the biggest threats to water quality is its microbiological contamination. It is through drinking water that, for example, pathogens of cholera, hepatitis A, typhoid fever and other diseases can enter the body.


Mineral water is water that contains dissolved salts of various elements. It often contains trace elements and biologically active compounds necessary for the human body. In most cases, such water has an underground origin. . TOPIC 2


Rational nutrition and diet


22


At what age, young or old, does the human body need more food? What main groups of organic substances should enter the human body with food? Why does the human body need minerals and vitamins?


Balance of nutrients and energy
As you have already learned, the need of living organisms (including humans) for nutrients and energy is determined by such factors as body mass, level of physical activity, etc. The quantitative ratio of different groups of substances is extremely important. For example, if there is too little or too much of individual substances in food, a person's metabolism may be disrupted, which will lead to a deterioration in health. To prevent this, you should follow the rules of a balanced diet and maintain the body's energy balance. A balanced diet is a diet in which all nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids), water, vitamins and minerals enter the body with food in the amount necessary for normal life. Minor imbalances are compensated by the body by converting some organic substances into others. But a significant imbalance causes metabolic disorders. Energy balance is the ratio of energy entering the body with food and energy expended in the process of the body's vital activity. For example, if a person consumes too much food, the body stores excess energy resources in the form of adipose tissue. Due to this, body weight increases. And if there is a shortage of food, the body begins to use up its reserves of adipose tissue, and body weight decreases.


Rational nutrition Rational nutrition is a balanced diet for a person, selected taking into account his age, gender, physical activity, peculiarities of living conditions, heredity and other factors. It determines not only the composition of the products consumed by a person, but also the diet and conditions of eating.


90. Metabolism and energy conversion


All people are different. Each person has their own individual characteristics
: body weight, health status, metabolic rate. The microbiota (the set of microorganisms in the human body) is also individual for each person. In addition, people live in regions with different climates, and the professions they choose provide different physical loads. As a result, differences in heredity, composition of the intestinal microbiota and other indicators are the reason why the same nutrition system can affect even siblings differently. That is why a balanced diet should be individual.


Dietary rationDiet is a set of products that a person consumes (or plans to consume) during a certain time (for example, a day). It is formed on the basis of a person's physiological needs for energy, nutrients and minerals and generally determines his health. The main general requirements for a diet are as follows: compliance with the body's energy expenditure; optimal ratio of various components in food: proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, water; rational distribution throughout the day; taking into account the individual characteristics of the body; pleasant organoleptic properties of food (appearance, taste, smell, etc.); sanitary and epidemiological integrity and harmlessness, etc. A properly selected diet is the basis of a balanced human diet, the quantitative ratio of which can be illustrated using the food pyramid. TOPIC 2


Toxic substances


23


Which substances are simple and which are compounds? What poisonous plants, animals and mushrooms are found in your
region? What is botulism? How do biochemical reactions
in the cells of living organisms differ from ordinary chemical reactions?


Origin and diversity of toxic substances Toxic substances are substances that in certain (usually small) doses disrupt the vital activity of living organisms and cause their poisoning, which causes diseases or even death of the organism. Some simple substances, such as lead or mercury, can be toxic, but most toxic substances are compounds. Toxic compounds can have an inorganic origin or be formed by living organisms. Both inorganic and organic toxic compounds can be formed both naturally and as products of industrial production. For example, gaseous Sulfur compounds can be released as a result of volcanic activity and during the production of sulfuric acid. Toxic compounds formed in the process of industrial production are called toxicants. These include pesticides, medicines, household chemicals, synthetic drugs. Toxic compounds of natural origin are called toxins. These include alcohol, nicotine, plant and animal poisons, narcotic substances produced by living organisms, bacterial toxins, etc.


Mechanisms of action of toxic compounds Toxic compounds can act at the level of both individual cells and the entire organism. At the cellular level, they negatively affect the work of enzymes, the cell membrane or cell wall (if present), the implementation of the processes of implementing hereditary information, etc. As a result, the metabolic processes inside the cell and with the environment are disrupted in the cells, and the substances necessary for life are not synthesized. The consequence of such disorders is the death of cells or the inability to perform

their functions (for example, nerve cells become unable to conduct nerve impulses). At the tissue-organ level, they affect individual organs or tissues. For example, toxins from cobra venom affect the nervous system, and toxins contained in viper venom destroy blood cells and tissues at the site of the bite. The affected organs cease to perform their functions (the heart stops contracting, the kidneys stop excreting metabolic products from the body, etc.), which causes the death of the organism.


ToxinsToxic compounds are produced by organisms of various groups: microorganisms, fungi, plants, animals, etc. In nature, toxins are necessary for living organisms for their vital activity. They can protect them from predators or parasites (Fig. 23.1) or help kill prey or competitors in the struggle for certain resources (Fig. 23.2).

Healthy lung Damaged lung


Fig. 23.3. The effect of tobacco smoking on human lungs


Alcohol and smoking products You certainly know that alcohol consumption has a negative effect on the human body. And the digestive organs are the first to be affected. First of all, alcohol, once in the stomach, destroys its mucous membrane and reduces the activity of gastric juice. Under the influence of alcohol
, the functioning of the pancreas deteriorates.
The liver suffers most from the effects of alcohol. It must neutralize all harmful substances that enter the body with alcohol and neutralize the products of its processing by the body. As a result, liver cells begin to die. They are replaced by fatty tissue; the liver is destroyed. The worst consequence can be cirrhosis of the liver and its complete death. Smoking becomes a bad habit because a person gets used to nicotine, which is contained in tobacco. And it, first of all, affects the cells of the nervous system. Smoking has a very negative effect on the respiratory system (Fig. 23.3). It causes significant damage to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, disrupts the functioning of the alveoli due to their contamination with resins and increases the risk of developing lung cancer. The digestive system also suffers from smoking. Tobacco smoke negatively affects teeth, causing them to darken and cracks in the enamel, which can lead to caries. The greatest danger to the digestive system is posed by the impurities contained in tobacco. Among them are many carcinogenic substances that can cause the development of cancerous tumors in the organs of the oral cavity, esophagus and stomach.


Toxic compounds of artificial origin Toxic compounds of artificial origin (toxicants) can be formed as main or by-products of production processes or agricultural activities. They are distinguished by their composition, chemical properties, degree of toxicity and other parameters. The division of toxicants according to the type of their toxic effect is very common.

Detoxification of toxic compounds


24


What functions does the human excretory system perform? What organs are included in it? What functions in the body do the liver, intestines, lungs, and skin perform? What are toxic substances?


Methods of neutralizing toxic compounds After toxic compounds enter the body, one of two processes occurs with them - biotransformation or fixation. Fixation is the interaction of molecules of a toxic substance with certain proteins, in which the molecules of toxic compounds themselves do not change, but form complexes with the molecules of these proteins. Such complexes reduce or completely eliminate the toxic effect of this substance and after some time are excreted from the body. Biotransformation is the biochemical transformation of toxic compounds that change their chemical composition. In most cases, the result of biotransformation is a decrease in the toxic properties of the substance (detoxification). But in some cases, the toxicity of the compound, on the contrary, increases. There are also compounds that become toxic precisely as a result of biotransformation. For example, when methyl alcohol enters the human body, the toxic effect is not caused by the alcohol itself, but by its breakdown products formed as a result of biotransformation, formaldehyde and formic acid. The biochemical basis of biotransformation processes are reactions that add or remove groups such as methyl (–CH 3 ), acetyl (–CH 3 COO – ), carboxyl (–COOH), hydroxyl (–OH), as well as sulfur atoms and groups that include such atoms. Synthesis (conjugation) reactions are also very important for biotransformation processes, as a result of which toxic substances interact with some cell molecules (glycine, glucuronic acid,
etc.) and form complexes that are safe for the body - conjugates.
The main organ in the human body in which biotransformation occurs is the liver. The endoplasmic reticulum of the cells of this organ contains a large number of enzymes that carry out the transformation of toxic compounds. This process also occurs in the intestinal tract, lungs, kidneys, blood and adipose tissue.

Elimination of toxic substances from the body


Fig. 24.1. Scheme of entry and elimination of toxic compounds from the human body


Elimination of toxic compounds from the body The kidneys play the greatest role in the elimination of toxic substances and products formed from them. But other systems also take an active part in this - these are the intestines, lungs and skin (Fig. 24.1). In the kidneys, water-soluble toxic compounds from the blood enter the capsule and tubules of the nephrons. This is done either by passive filtration (due to diffusion through the walls of blood vessels) or by active transport (with the involvement of an active mechanism of transferring substances through membranes with energy expenditure) (Fig. 24.2).

97. TOPIC 2


Fat-soluble compounds and products of the breakdown of toxins formed in the liver are excreted through the intestines. They are excreted with feces, to which they enter in several ways: as part of bile from the gallbladder, where they are secreted by liver cells; from intestinal epithelial cells, which secrete toxic substances into the intestinal cavity; with undigested food residues with which they entered the body (if toxic substances were not absorbed by the intestinal epithelial cells). Volatile compounds are released through the lungs. For example, in the case of starvation or some metabolic disorders, a person can
smell acetone. Its source is ketone bodies, which are formed
in such situations in adipose tissue and are partially excreted through the lungs. The skin, like the kidneys, secretes water-soluble compounds through its sweat glands. Thus, an unpleasant odor from a person the next day after alcohol consumption is caused by the fact that toxic compounds of alcoholic beverages and their decomposition products are excreted, including through the surface of the skin.


Artificial detoxification The process of neutralizing and removing toxic substances from the body is called detoxification. The mechanisms of this process were considered above using the example of the human body. But the detoxification process can be not only natural. Modern medicine widely uses the processes of artificial detoxification in cases where the human body cannot carry it out on its own. One of the most common methods of detoxification of the human body is dialysis. The basis of this technology is the filtration of blood through a semipermeable membrane. On one side of the membrane is human blood with toxic substances, and on the other - the dialysis solution, into which these substances pass. This is possible due to the osmotic pressure that arises on the membrane due to the difference in the concentration of toxic substances in the blood and the dialysis solution. Dialysis in humans can be carried out both in their body and outside it. It is used, for example, in the case of severe poisoning, liver dysfunction, etc. In the case of kidney failure, for example, special devices are used for dialysis - hemodialyzers, which are called "artificial kidneys" (Fig. 24.3).

Dialysis can be performed without the use of dialysis solutions. In the case of hemofiltration, plasma with toxic substances is removed from the blood and replaced with a special solution. In the case of hemoperfusion, the blood is passed through an adsorbent (a substance that absorbs toxic substances).


In some cases, for example, as a result of taking certain medications, the products of their processing in the body can turn the urine blue. A change in the color of urine is an important diagnostic sign for detecting a number of diseases or poisoning by certain substances.


Special antidotes (antidotes) are often used to neutralize toxic substances. They can prevent the absorption of toxins into the blood or eliminate toxic reactions. Antidotes include activated carbon, glucose, methylene
blue, etc.

Neurohumoral Regulation of Metabolic Processes


25


What systems of the human body carry out nervous and humoral regulation? What organs are part of the nervous and endocrine systems in the human body? What is metabolism? What functions do the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems perform in humans?


Cerebral cortex


Intercostal muscles


Sensory impulse


Sensory neuron impulse


Nervous regulation of metabolic processes Nervous regulation is carried out primarily by the autonomic nervous system, which is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic. As you already know, its activity is based on the principle of antagonism (counteraction). The processes that the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems stimulate are opposite. For example, the sympathetic nervous system
accelerates the heartbeat, while the parasympathetic slows it down. As a result,
their simultaneous and coordinated action allows for very precise regulation of the work of internal organs (Fig. 25.1). The excretion of metabolic products from the body is also largely regulated by the nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system affects the rate of urine formation, with which metabolic products are excreted. Its signals narrow the arteries of the glomeruli in the kidneys. If the arterioles that carry blood to the glomeruli narrow, then less urine is formed, if those that carry blood from the glomeruli narrow, more. The parasympathetic nervous system also affects the work of the kidneys, regulating the excretion of NaCl.Humoral regulation of metabolic processes

Fig. 25.1. Nervous regulation of the respiratory process


Humoral regulation is the coordination of the physiological functions of the body with the help of hormones - specific substances that are carried by various fluids of the body (blood, lymph, tissue fluid). Humoral regulation is carried out by endocrine glands (glands


of


internal secretion), which are the producers of hormones. Endocrine glands secrete the substances they have produced into the blood. One of the features of humoral regulation is the work of its regulatory substances in interaction, because hormones do not act alone, but only in a complex. Some of them accelerate certain processes in cells and tissues, while others slow them down. This allows for very fine regulation of the speed and direction of processes controlled by humoral regulation. For example, the level of glucose in human blood is controlled by the action of two hormones of the pancreas - insulin and glucagon. Insulin reduces the level of glucose, and glucagon, on the contrary, increases it.


Interaction of the nervous and humoral regulation systems All processes that occur in the human body are not separated from each other, but occur in close interaction. The systems regulating
these processes are very reliable and usually duplicate each other. Therefore,
in the event of damage to one of them, regulation can be carried out by the other. The relationship between the two types of regulation is manifested in the fact that the nervous and humoral systems influence each other. Thus, the nervous system can cause a change in the intensity of the release of biologically active substances, and the action of hormones can cause the emergence of nerve impulses and regulate the work of individual parts of the nervous system. For example, when a person finds himself in a dangerous situation, signals from the nervous system cause the release of hormones that mobilize the body's resources to save him. In such cases, a person can lift very heavy objects or jump a long distance, which is impossible for him in a normal state. There is also a reverse effect. As a result of some joyful event, for example, winning a competition, the body releases hormones that act on the brain and cause positive emotions.. Main provisions of the topic
