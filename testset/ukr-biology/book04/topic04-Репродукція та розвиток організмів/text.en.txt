Reproduction of living organisms
Reproduction is the ability of living organisms to self-
reproduce, to produce offspring, which are a means of preserving species and ensuring the continuity of their existence. The ability to self-reproduce is one of the key features of living things, which distinguishes living organisms from non-living systems. Reproduction of living organisms occurs in the form of reproduction in various ways. It should be noted that the ability to reproduce is not only possessed by cellular organisms, but also by non-cellular life forms such as viruses.


Forms of reproduction of living organismsThere are several main forms of reproduction of living organisms. First of all, sexual (during which sex cells are formed) and asexual (during which sex cells are not formed) reproduction are distinguished. Vegetative reproduction can be considered a separate form of reproduction, separating it from asexual. In such a case, asexual reproduction is considered to be reproduction during which specialized cells that are not gametes are formed (for example, zoospores of algae or conidiospores of fungi). Vegetative reproduction is considered to be reproduction during which multicellular structures are formed (buds in hydra, tubers in potatoes, etc.).

Asexual reproduction Asexual reproduction is the formation of a
new organism from one or a group of cells of
the original maternal organism, during which sex cells are not formed and the sexual process does not occur. In this case, only one parent individual participates in reproduction, which transmits its hereditary information to daughter organisms. This method of reproduction is common in all groups of living organisms and is the original method of reproduction for cellular forms. A significant advantage of asexual reproduction is that in this variant, all individuals can produce new offspring, while in the case of sexual reproduction only females are capable of this.


Fig. 43.1. Sexual reproduction of a unicellular organism


Sexual reproduction Sexual reproduction is a type of reproduction in which specialized germ cells are formed and the sexual process occurs. Sexual reproduction is observed in representatives of most systematic groups of the plant and animal world (Fig. 43.1). In the case of sexual reproduction, the formation of a new organism usually occurs with the participation of two parent organisms, but in the case of hermaphroditism, one individual can also reproduce sexually. During sexual reproduction, the fusion of sex cells — gametes of the male and female organism occurs. Thus, the new organism carries the hereditary information of both parents..TOPIC 4


Features of the processes of regeneration of the human body


44


Which organisms are able to restore lost body parts? What process is the basis of vegetative reproduction in animals and plants? Which animals are able to restore lost body parts?


Regeneration and its varieties Regeneration is the ability of living organisms to restore their damaged or lost structures. It is one of the fundamental properties of living organisms, although it manifests itself in different organisms to different degrees. If some organisms can self-restore even after very severe damage (hydra, planaria, etc.), then others are capable of regeneration to a small extent (nematodes). The regenerative properties of the human body are not the most outstanding, but it is still capable of restoring its damage. The level of regenerative properties is influenced by the fact that humans are a highly developed species with complex behavior. And in the process of evolution, the regenerative properties of such species decreased. This was due to the fact that a well-developed nervous system significantly reduced the risk of damage, for the elimination of which regeneration was required. There are two forms of regeneration - intracellular and cellular. Intracellular regeneration occurs inside cells due to molecular mechanisms and restores the organelles and molecular structures necessary for the cell. Cellular regeneration occurs at the level of the organism due to cell division, which allows for complete or partial restoration of tissues and organs. Depending on the tasks that the regeneration process solves in the human body, physiological and reparative regeneration are distinguished.


Physiological regeneration Physiological regeneration is intended to restore the structures of the body that are damaged during normal physiological
processes. This type of regeneration occurs throughout
a person's life (Fig. 44.1). For example, due to physiological regeneration

Kidney (300–500 days)


Lungs (2–3 weeks)


Liver (150–180 days)


Stomach epithelium (3–5 days)


Lens of the eye (not renewed)


there is a constant change in the epithelium of the intestinal tract and the covering epithelium; this same process is the basis for the renewal of erythrocytes, the life span of which is quite limited due to the absence of a nucleus in the cell, etc. But there are tissues in which renewal by cell division is impossible. For example, highly specialized
cells,
such as neurons. In these cases, regeneration occurs by gradual replacement of organelles (including intracellular ones).


Skin (2–3 weeks)


Intestinal epithelium (3–4 days)


Fig. 44.1. Periodicity of renewal of human body structures due to physiological regeneration


Reparative regenerationReparative regeneration begins in the event of damage or death of body structures that are not a consequence of normal physiological processes. Such damage occurs as a result of diseases or injuries. In this case, normal physiological regeneration is significantly enhanced and becomes reparative.Reparative regeneration can be complete and incomplete. In the case of complete regeneration, the damaged tissue is completely replaced by a new one and the damage disappears without a trace. In the case of incomplete regeneration, the restoration of functions occurs at the expense of the surrounding tissues, and the site of damage is filled with connective tissue, which forms a scar..TOPIC 4


Transplantation of tissues and organs
in humans. Rules of biological ethics


45


What is immunity? How does the body's immune system recognize foreign biological objects? What is an antigen? What is an antibody? What should be considered during a blood transfusion?


Tissue and organ transplantationTransplantation is the transplantation of an organ or tissue that was taken from the donor's body to the recipient. Transplanted organs and tissues are called transplants. Transplantation is performed by surgical methods. Modern medicine can successfully transplant many human organs and tissues: heart, kidney, bone marrow, lungs, liver, hair, skin, etc. In the case when not living organs and tissues, but their mechanical or electronic analogues are placed in the recipient's body, such artificial analogues are called implants, and the process itself is called implantation. The main problem of transplantation is overcoming the immune barrier. The body's immune system recognizes any foreign organs and tissues and begins to attack them, trying to destroy foreign cells. This causes the death and rejection of transplants. To prevent this process, doctors have to suppress the patient's immune system with the help of special drugs.


Types of transplantation Depending on the origin of the transplant, several types of transplantation are distinguished. Types of transplantation


Type
of transplantation
Features of the type of transplantation


Cell engineering and cloning


This technology involves the extraction of the necessary cells from the patient's body and the cultivation of the necessary organs and tissues from them using cell engineering methods


Isotransplantation The donor is a person who is completely identical in genome to the recipient. This is possible when the donor and recipient are monozygotic twins


168. Reproduction and development of organisms


Type of transplantation Features of the type of transplantation


Autotransplantation The recipient is a donor for himself. This method is widely used in cases of skin transplantation (especially in the case of burns, when skin from undamaged areas is transplanted to damaged areas) and bone marrow


Allotransplantation The donor is a person with a genotype different from the recipient's genotype. This option is used most often, because it is the easiest to
implement
in practice. To overcome problems with the immune system, transplants are selected that are most similar in antigen set to the donor organs.


Xenotransplantation The donor is not a human, but an animal. In addition to problems with transplant rejection, this technology requires consideration of moral and social aspects, because the use of such transplants may contradict the moral or religious beliefs of the recipient.


Principles of biological ethics Transplantation of tissues and organs makes the problem of bioethics - the moral aspects of the use of these technologies - relevant. The basic principles of bioethics, which it is desirable to adhere to in order to avoid ethical problems, were proposed by American scientists T. L. Beauchamp and J. F. Childress. These principles are: the principle of autonomy (an individual has the right to manage his or her own health); the principle of “do no harm” (requires minimizing harm during medical intervention); the principle of beneficence (a doctor is obliged to take actions aimed at improving the patient’s condition); the principle of justice (requires equal treatment of all patients and equal access to resources for medical care). TOPIC 4


Growth and development. Aging and cell death


46


What are the main properties characteristic of living organisms? What can be the lifespan of living organisms? What stages of development can be in the life cycle of insects?


Cell growth The growth of cells in living organisms can occur at different speeds. This speed depends on the structural features of the cell itself (prokaryotic cells divide faster) and environmental conditions. The limits of cell growth can also be different. In most cases, cells grow only to a certain size, and this size is small. But in some cases, cell growth can be practically unlimited. Such growth is often observed in fungi, which are capable of forming giant multinucleated mycelia.


Cell development The division of eukaryotic cells (including human cells) in most cases is carried out by mitosis. After division, the proportion of cells formed may vary. In the early stages of human embryogenesis, cells divide again after division. Later, cell differentiation begins and only some of them retain the ability to divide. Such cells that retain the ability to divide and remain undifferentiated are called stem cells. Cell differentiation is the process of forming specialized cells that acquire certain structural features that enable them to perform the necessary functions with high efficiency. Cell differentiation is achieved by regulating the work of genes. The genome of a cell as a whole remains unchanged, but only a certain set of genes is actively working in it. Cell differentiation in the human body is an irreversible process.


Aging and cell death Over time, cells in the body die. This death can be
caused by both external (high or low temperature, mechanical
damage, etc.) and internal (aging) causes. Ageing

Fig. 46.1. Scheme of events during the processes of apoptosis and necrosis of cells in the human body


cell death is an important way to stabilize the number of cells in the body. It is regulated by complex molecular and genetic mechanisms. The lifespan of individual cells in the human body is very different.
For example, cells of the digestive tract epithelium
live for several days, erythrocytes - three months, and neurons of the brain - for dozens of years. In multicellular living organisms (including humans), two main ways of cell death are distinguished - apoptosis and necrosis (Fig. 46.1). Apoptosis is a programmed cell death. It is initiated by special molecular signals and occurs according to a certain algorithm of events in the cell. In the case of apoptosis, the cell membrane is not destroyed. After the signal reaches the cell nucleus, it begins to synthesize proteins necessary for the destruction of its own structures. As a result of apoptosis, so-called apoptotic bodies are formed from cells, which are absorbed by macrophages or neighboring cells. Necrosis is an accidental or pathological cell death. It can occur under the influence of physical, chemical or biological factors and is less orderly than apoptosis. During necrosis, the cell membrane is destroyed and the contents of the cell enter the external environment. This often causes inflammation. TOPIC 4

Lipoma


Problems of cell cycle disorders The cell cycle in human cells is standard for mammals. In most cases, it occurs without deviation. And the duration of interphase can be different and depends on the level of specialization of the cell. The more specialized the cell, the longer the duration of the interphase of its cell cycle. However, in some cases, the cell cycle can be disrupted. This can be the cause of non-standard variants of cell division (for example, amitosis or endomitosis). But the greatest threat to the human body is the situation when a cell loses control over its divisions and begins to divide intensively. Such disorders cause the appearance of tumors of various nature. Such tumors are divided into two large groups - benign and malignant.


Benign tumorsBenign tumors are neoplasms in the body caused by uncontrolled but limited cell proliferation that do not spread to neighboring tissues (not capable of invasion) and distant organs (do not form metastases
).
Benign tumors are similar in structure to the tissues from which they arose (Fig. 47.1).


Fig. 47.1. Benign tumors - lipoma and neuroma


172. Reproduction and development of organisms


The degree of their differentiation is significantly higher than that of malignant tumor cells. Benign tumors usually grow slowly and are limited by a connective tissue capsule. They do not cause pain, but can disrupt the functioning of organs, and in some cases can transform into malignant tumors. The diversity of benign tumors is high. They are classified according to the type of tissue from which they arose.

Adenoma Glandular epithelium


Epithelioma Epithelial

Neuroma Nervous tissue


Osteoma

Lymphoma Lymphatic


Myoma Muscular


The most common benign tumors are uterine fibroids (develop from the muscles of the uterus), papillomas (develop on the surface of the skin or mucous membranes), adenomas (develop from the glandular epithelium of various glands). Surgical intervention is often used to treat benign tumors. In modern medicine, cryocoagulation is a popular treatment technology for some types of such tumors, when tumor cells are destroyed using low temperatures. TOPIC 4

What is health? What is a disease? What consequences can a violation of the cell cycle lead to? What is a benign tumor? What factors can cause mutations?


Oncogenic factors Oncogenic factors are physical, chemical, or biological factors that cause the formation of benign or malignant tumors in the body. Oncogenic factors are highly diverse. Oncogenic factors


Group of factors Factors Consequences of the action of factors


Physical Ionizing and ultraviolet radiation Ultraviolet radiation increases the risk of skin cancer, and the action of ionizing radiation can affect any organ or tissue

Chemical Aromatic carbohydrates (benzidine, benzpyrene, etc.), some nitrogen compounds, dioxin, alcohols, tobacco smoke substances, etc.


Can affect any organ or tissue with subsequent tumor formation


Biological Some viruses, mobile genetic elements, errors in cell repair systems, the action of epigenetic factors


Malignant tumors Malignant tumors are neoplasms in the body caused by unlimited and uncontrolled cell proliferation (Fig. 48.1), which spread to neighboring tissues (invade) and distant organs (form metastases). The term cancerous tumor or cancer is often used for malignant tumors (Fig. 48.2). This term was proposed by Hippocrates, who described a tumor that


externally


resembled


a crab or


crayfish due to local metastases that penetrated into neighboring tissues. The characteristic features of malignant tumors are: rapid uncontrolled growth; penetration


into


neighboring tissues with the formation of local metastases (invasions); movement of individual tumor cells through lymphatic and blood vessels to distant organs and tissues (metastasis formation); toxic effect on the entire body due to the production of toxins by tumor cells; physical exhaustion, weight loss; the presence of mechanisms for “evading” the attention of the body’s immune system; the presence of a large number of mutations in tumor cells; low level of differentiation of tumor cells; loss of the ability of cells to undergo apoptosis; intensive formation of blood vessels in the tumor.

in malignant tumors are poorly differentiated, so cells of different types can be distinguished among them.

Variety and methods of treating malignant tumors There are many methods of treating malignant cells. And if the disease is detected at an early stage, the patient's chances of recovery are very high. But if the disease was detected at a later stage, the situation becomes much more complicated. Although even in such cases, a person can often be cured. Therefore, early diagnosis and prevention of the disease are very important in the fight against cancer. The main methods of treating malignant tumors are: surgical removal of the tumor; chemotherapy (destruction of tumor cells with special drugs); radiotherapy (destruction of tumor cells with radiation); photodynamic therapy (destruction of tumor cells with light of a certain wavelength); hormonal therapy (some types of tumors are sensitive to the action of hormones); immunotherapy (stimulation of the body's immune system to increase its effectiveness in fighting the tumor). Most often, to increase the effectiveness of treatment, combination therapy is used, in which several methods of destroying the tumor are used simultaneously.


Prevention of cancer diseases Oncological diseases are very common and dangerous. Modern medicine has developed many methods of treating them, but so far

Fig. 48.3. Examination of the mammary glands using a special device (mammograph) is one of the common methods of preventing cancer diseases


. Prevention is considered the best way to fight. It is easier to prevent than to treat. Prevention of these diseases is aimed at avoiding or weakening the action of carcinogenic factors. This helps to significantly reduce the risk of their occurrence. Thus, not consuming carcinogens in food significantly reduces the risk of developing cancer of the digestive system, uterus and mammary glands. Avoiding smoking and regular stay in rooms where people smoke reduces the risk of developing cancer of the lungs, esophagus, stomach, bladder, etc. Some viral infections, a sedentary lifestyle, stress and nervous overload, exposure to areas with high levels of radiation also cause the development of oncogenic diseases. Therefore, avoiding the effects of these factors is also a good preventive measure. Early diagnosis of cancer is also very important. The chances of curing cancer in the early stages are more than 90%. Therefore, regular examination to detect early stages of cancer can also be attributed to the means of preventing severe forms of cancer (Fig. 48.3)..TOPIC 4


Sex cells. Features of gametogenesis in humans

What are the methods of reproduction? During which method of reproduction are germ cells formed? Why are male and female germ cells different in size?


Gonads and germ cellsThe human gonads are the testicles (in men) and the ovaries (in women). The testicles are oval paired gonads located outside the abdominal cavity in a skin sac (scrotum). They belong to the glands of mixed secretion: the external function is the formation of sperm, and the internal function is the secretion of the hormone testosterone. Each testicle consists of approximately 1000 tortuous seminiferous tubules with a total length of up to 300–400 m. During puberty, male germ cells, spermatozoa, are formed in the seminiferous tubules of the testicles. From the testicles, they travel to the appendages, where they mature for two weeks. The ovaries are paired almond-shaped gonads. They form and mature female sex cells - egg cells. The ovaries also produce the sex hormones estradiol and progesterone. The ovaries are attached to the abdominal cavity by several ligaments. The size of the ovary is 3 × 2 × 1 cm, and it weighs about 7 g. Sperm are motile cells that have three sections - the head, neck and tail. The tail contains special proteins that ensure the movement of the sperm. As a result of the oscillatory movements of the tail, the sperm can independently move its head forward at a speed of 2–3 mm per minute. Mitochondria are concentrated in the neck, which produce energy used for movement. It
also contains a modified centrosome, which promotes the process of division
of the fertilized egg. The cell head contains a nucleus with hereditary material and a special organelle - the acrosome. It is needed so that the sperm can overcome the egg shell during fertilization: the enzymes contained in the acrosome dissolve this shell.


178. Reproduction and development of organisms


The egg is much larger than the sperm. It contains nutrients that provide the first divisions of the future embryo, and does not have a flagellum. The hereditary material of the egg is contained in the nucleus. Outside, it is surrounded by special shells that are formed during the development of the egg in the ovary. They prevent the penetration of more than one sperm into the egg and contribute to the rooting of the embryo in the mucous membrane of the uterus. The process of formation of sex cells in the gonads is called gametogenesis. Spermatogenesis occurs in the testicles, and oogenesis in the ovaries.

Spermatogenesis in humans Spermatogenesis is the process of spermatozoa development in humans (Fig. 49.1). It occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the male gonad - the testis. The process of spermatogenesis is complex, it ends during puberty with the formation of spermatozoa - mature male germ cells capable of fertilization. The formation of spermatozoa is preceded by a double division (one that occurs quickly one after the other), as a result of which half of the chromosomes remain in the nucleus of the germ cell (23 instead of 46). Four periods of spermatogenesis are distinguished: reproduction, growth, maturation and formation. During the reproduction period, spermatozoa (primary male germ cells) divide several times by mitosis. During the growth period, the formed cells increase in size, and their nuclei undergo the first phase (prophase of the first division) of meiosis. As a result, they become first-order spermatocytes. During the maturation period, subsequent phases of meiosis occur and second-order spermatocytes (after the first division)
and spermatids (after the second
division) are formed. From one first-order spermatocyte, two second

Fig. 49.2. Oogenesis in humans


Oogenesis is the process of egg cell development (Fig. 49.2). This process is associated with the growth and development of primary follicles located in the cortical layer of the ovary. The primary follicle consists of an immature egg cell surrounded by a layer of epithelial cells and connective tissue. In the first (follicular) phase of the menstrual cycle, the growth of one or more primary follicles begins, but usually only one follicle reaches the stage of full maturation; the others regress. The process of follicle maturation in a 28-day menstrual cycle takes 14 days (in a 21-day cycle - 10–11 days). There are three periods of oogenesis: reproduction, growth, and maturation. During the reproduction period, the number of oogonia (primary female germ cells) increases by mitotic divisions. During the growth period, the division of oogonia stops and they form first-order oocytes. Oocytes are buried in the ovarian tissue, covered with membranes, and form follicles. At the end of the growth period, yolk accumulates in the oocyte. During the maturation period, two meiotic divisions occur, as a result of which half of the chromosomes remain in the nucleus of the germ cell (23 instead of 46). After the first division, a second-order oocyte and the first polar body are formed, and after the second, a mature egg and the second polar body are formed. Polar bodies do not participate in the reproduction processes and perform the function of removing excess genetic material. Thus, unlike spermatogenesis, during oogenesis,
only one full-fledged mature
gamete is formed from one initial cell. In addition, a characteristic feature of oogenesis is that the periods of reproduction and growth of gametes occur in the embryonic period

Fig. 49.3. Abnormal forms of spermatozoa that can occur with alcohol abuse


The influence of various factors on gametogenesis The process of gamete formation in humans depends on genetic, hormonal and other factors. Gametogenesis in humans is regulated by four genes, three of which ( O , T , Tif ) are located on the X chromosome, and one ( R tif ) is on the Y chromosome. The O gene is responsible for oogenesis, and T is for spermatogenesis. The Tif gene blocks the work of the T gene, which allows the O gene to work. Which of these genes will work depends on the R tif gene, localized on the Y chromosome. If the cell has a Y chromosome, the Rtif gene blocks the Tif gene. In such a situation, the T gene works and the body produces spermatozoa. After the start of gamete production, the body carries out fine regulation of this process hormonally with the help of the endocrine system. However, other factors can also affect gametogenesis.
Alcohol, smoking and
drug use, as well as some environmental factors (radiation, certain chemicals, etc.) have an extremely negative effect on this process. These factors can disrupt the process of spermatozoa formation (Fig. 49.3), which becomes the cause of their insufficient mobility and infertility. They also pose a significant danger to oocytes during their maturation and the formation of membranes. In addition, these factors significantly increase the number of mutations in germ cells, which also has a negative effect on their viability and increases the risk of giving birth to children with hereditary defects. TOPIC 4


Fertilization. Impaired fertilization in humans


50


What is sexual reproduction? What is the sexual process? What are the gametes? What are the structural features of mammalian gametes? What is a zygote? Why is external fertilization not characteristic of terrestrial animals?


Fertilization in humans, as in other living organisms, is the process of union (fusion) of mature male (sperm) and female (egg) sex cells, as a result of which one cell (zygote) is formed, which is the beginning of a new organism. Humans are representatives of mammals, and therefore fertilization in them is internal - it occurs in the female body. Male (sperm) and female (egg) gametes participate in fertilization. Fertilization usually occurs in the fallopian tube. Several stages are distinguished in this process. Stages of fertilization in humans


Stage
Processes that occur


Penetration Overcoming the outer shells of the egg cell by the sperm - the lustrous membrane and the radiant corona. To overcome them, special enzymes are used that are located on the surface and in the acrosome of the gametes. But the enzymes of one sperm are not enough to overcome the shells. Therefore, fertilization is possible only if there is a sufficient number of spermatozoa.


Cortical reaction After penetration of one of the spermatozoa into the egg cell, specific enzymes are released to the outside, which change the conformation of the lustrous membrane proteins, thereby compacting it and making it impossible for other spermatozoa to penetrate the egg cell.


Formation of the zygote The gamete nuclei fuse inside the egg cell, forming a zygote.


Causes of impaired fertilization processes in humans The causes of impaired fertilization processes can be diverse. Their occurrence can be associated with problems in the body of both men and women.

Where are gametes formed in the human body? What are the structural features of human sperm and egg cells? Where does the zygote form in the human body?


Features of human reproduction The existence of a person, like any other biological species, is possible only if the process of reproduction (multiplication) occurs with the appearance of individuals of new generations. Reproduction in humans is a complex process that can be influenced by a large number of factors. These factors can be non-biological (physical factors, toxic substances, etc.), biological (diseases, injuries, metabolic disorders) or social. The social component plays an extremely important role in human reproduction. It is social factors that strongly influence a person's decision to have a child and the number of children in a family. The living conditions of human families are also largely shaped by socio-economic factors, which affects both the psychological state of people and their health. Inadequate nutrition, constant stress, and uncertainty about the future can cause disorders in the reproductive system and lead to infertility.


Reproductive healthAccording to the definition of the WHO (World Health Organization), reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being in all matters of the functions and processes of the human reproductive system.Good reproductive health of a person means that she is able to conceive children, has the opportunity to have sexual relations without the risk of
sexually transmitted diseases, and can plan
the number of children she will have. Reproductive health of women also provides for the safety of pregnancy and childbirth, the survival of the child, and the well-being of the mother.


184. Reproduction and development of organisms


Reproductive medicine Reproductive medicine deals with nonbiological and biological factors that can cause reproductive disorders in humans. Reproductive medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility in humans. It is based on the use of the latest developments in endocrinology, surgery, genetic engineering and other fields. Well-established and popular technologies of reproductive medicine are artificial insemination technologies - in vitro and intracorporeal fertilization. In vitro fertilization is a process during which an egg is fertilized outside the human body (the so-called “in vitro fertilization”) (Fig. 51.1). This type of fertilization was first used in 1978 in Great Britain. In vitro fertilization can be performed in cases where natural fertilization is impossible due to a disease of the man or woman (fallopian tube obstruction, damage to the sperm ducts, etc.). Intracorporeal fertilization is a process during which fertilization of an egg occurs directly in the human body by artificially introducing sperm into the uterus using a special catheter


.


It is used in some cases of male


infertility


and in situations where immunological infertility occurs (due to an aggressive attack by the woman's immune system on sperm).


Prospects


for reproductive medicine Reproductive medicine is a field that is currently actively developing. Its main prospects are related to solving such issues as overcoming infertility, birth control, reducing the risk of pregnancy pathologies, and reducing infant and maternal mortality. Assisted reproductive technologies (for example, artificial insemination) are used to overcome infertility. These methods allow fertilization to be carried out both inside the woman's body and outside it. The latest developments in this field make it possible for couples who until recently could not even dream of having children to have children. The problems of pregnancy pathologies, infant and maternal mortality are closely related to environmental and social problems. Environmental pollution, social discrimination against women, lack of access to education and medical care have a very negative impact on the reproductive health of the population.


The biosocial essence of man and his reproduction The influence of both biological and social factors is extremely important for human life. The interaction of the biological and social components also affects
human reproduction. The basis of reproductive behavior are instinctive programs
that have been established for millions of years in the process of human evolution. But their specific manifestation can significantly change in different social environments. In addition, human reproduction is also influenced by the level of development of technologies in society. For example, the basis of agriculture in Europe was the plow, and then the plow. Working with them required high physical exertion, and, accordingly, the main cultivation of the land was carried out by men. This contributed to the spread and consolidation of monogamous marriages (one man and one woman) in the cultural tradition. This ensured the most effective transfer of both genetic and material inheritance to their descendants. And in many African countries, the basis of agriculture was the cultivation of the land with a hoe. That is why the coats of arms of several African countries (Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, etc.) depict a hoe.


186. Reproduction and development of organisms


In this case, the main cultivation of the land was carried out by women and children. Therefore, men who had many wives and children had an advantage in the transfer of genetic and material inheritance. This contributed to the consolidation of polygynous marriages (one man and several women) in the local cultural tradition.


Problems of regulation of reproduction in humans Regulation of reproduction in humans can be carried out with the help of both biological and social factors. Before the spread of modern medical technologies (hygiene, vaccination, antibiotics, etc.), the population was regulated mainly by biological factors. Thus, in 1910, 24% of children under the age of 1 died in the Kyiv, 21% in the Kharkiv, 20.9% in the Kherson, and 17.2% in the Poltava provinces. On average, 43% of children did not survive to the age of 5. The main cause of mortality was disease, and during periods of crop failure, hunger.
Medical advances have sharply reduced mortality. Thus, according to
the UN, in Ukraine in 2013 the mortality rate of children under 5 years of age was 1% (in European countries it is half that). In addition, in most countries, living conditions have improved significantly over the past hundred years. And people got used to giving birth to six to eight children, because this was the only way to survive in conditions of high infant mortality. Therefore, the population of our planet grew rapidly during the twentieth century. And the capacity of the planet's ecosystems is not infinite and they cannot feed more than a certain number of people. Therefore, the problem of population size has become very relevant. The solution to the problem of regulating reproduction in humans is facilitated by an increase in the level of education of the population, the development of reproductive medicine, urbanization (the birth rate is decreasing in large cities) and a number of other factors.

How do mammals reproduce? What is a zygote? What is an embryo? Why do humans have such a long childhood? What factors can affect the development of living organisms?


Ontogenesis and factors influencing it Human ontogenesis is the individual development of an organism from the moment of conception to natural death. The term “ontogenesis” was proposed by the German scientist E. Haeckel (1866). The ontogenesis of a certain organism is based on the process of sequential and irreversible implementation of its hereditary information. The implementation of this information (and, accordingly, the course of ontogenesis) can be influenced by
many different factors. These include environmental conditions
, neurohumoral and hormonal regulation, etc.


Embryonic period of development The embryonic (germinal) period lasts from the moment of formation of the zygote to the birth of the child (Fig. 52.1). It is divided into three subperiods: initial (first week), embryonic (2–8 weeks) and the period of fetal development (from the 9th week to birth). During this period, all tissues and organ systems of the organism are formed from a single cell (Fig. 52.2).

Human embryonic development has several stages: fragmentation, formation of germ layers and membranes, formation of tissues (histogenesis) and organs (organogenesis). Four to five days after fertilization, a single-layered embryo with a cavity inside enters the uterine cavity. After that, it is immersed in its mucous membrane and attached to it. This process is called implantation. In the next period of intrauterine development, three germinal membranes are formed, which are formed from part of the cells of the embryo. The outer membrane has villi with capillaries through which the embryo is nourished and breathes. The inner membrane is thin and transparent, it forms a bubble, the cavity of which is filled with amniotic fluid, which protects the embryo from mechanical damage. The outer and middle membranes participate in the formation of the placenta together with the mucous membrane of the uterus. On the 10-14th day after fertilization, germ layers are formed, from which all organs and tissues are then formed. During the development process, parts of the embryo interact with each other. This interaction is the cause of the so-called embryonic induction. The essence of this phenomenon is that in certain areas of the embryo, so-called organizer cells function. These cells secrete certain signal molecules, which cause the differentiation of adjacent cells into the corresponding organs and tissues. If such organizer cells are removed or transferred to another part of the embryo, the development of normal cells in this zone of the embryo will follow a completely different path. A fetus is an organism from the 9th week of
intrauterine development until birth. The fetus has its own
environment, which consists of the embryonic membranes,


amniotic


fluid, and umbilical cord. The umbilical cord is a cord-like organ that extends from the placenta and connects the fetus to the mother's body.


Postembryonic period The postembryonic period is the period of human life after birth (Fig. 52.3). It can be divided into several stages, the duration of which differs in men and women. The following age periods are distinguished in human life: Infant period (first 10 days): the body undergoes restructuring due to adaptation to life outside the mother's body. Structures associated with metabolism through the placenta are destroyed. The thoracic period (10 days - 1 year) is characterized by the highest growth and development rates of all organ systems in the postembryonic period, as well as the strengthening of the musculoskeletal system, the formation of a large number of conditioned reflexes. Early childhood (1–3 years): high growth and development rates of all organ systems are observed; the beginning of independent active movements; the transition to eating adult food; the development of milk teeth; the beginning of using speech. At the end of the period, the growth rates slow down. First childhood (4–7 years): growth rates slow down; there is an active accumulation of information about the surrounding world; skills and abilities necessary for independent life are formed; permanent teeth develop. Second childhood (8–12 years in boys, 8–11 years in girls): relatively low growth rates; active growth continues in

accumulation of information about the surrounding world and formation of skills and abilities necessary for independent life. Adolescence (13–16 years in boys, 12–15 years in girls): beginning of the period of puberty; sharp increase in growth rates; significant hormonal changes in the body; beginning of the functioning of the reproductive systems. Adolescence (17–21 years in boys, 16–20 years in girls): completion of the period of puberty; decrease in the rate of development and end of body growth; reproductive systems enter a normal mode of functioning. Mature age (first period — 22–35 years in men, 21–35 years in women): the most productive period of life; the development of abilities reaches the highest level, the work of all body systems is most effective. Mature age (second period — 36–60 years in men, 36–55 years in women): a very productive period; fairly high physical capabilities are combined with rich experience and allow achieving the highest results. At the end of the period, there is a gradual fading of the functions of the reproductive system. Old age (61–74 years in men, 56–74 years in women): the state of the body depends significantly on the characteristics of the lifestyle that a person led in previous periods. Reproductive functions in men continue to fade, in women they cease altogether. Old age (75–90 years): structural, functional and biochemical changes occur in the body, which significantly limit its capabilities. Longevity (more than 90 years): structural, functional and biochemical changes continue in the body, which limit its capabilities.. Main provisions of the topic

Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC) Ancient Greek scientist, son of a court physician, student of Plato, tutor of Alexander (Alexander) of Macedon. Aristotle created the first natural classification of animals (he distinguished groups of plants
and animals, expressed the idea of the existence in nature of gradual
transitions from inanimate bodies to plants and from them to animals). According to contemporaries, Aristotle was a short man, weak in body, and sickly. He spoke quickly and had a pronunciation defect (he mixed the sound "r" and "l").


Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) German naturalist and philosopher. He developed the theory of the origin of multicellular organisms (the theory of gastrula), formulated the biogenetic law, and built the first genealogical tree of the animal kingdom. Haeckel is also known as an artist: the illustrated book "Atlas of Natural Forms" was created based on the scientist's sketches. The first edition of the atlas contained 100 lithographs of various organisms, many of which were first described by Haeckel himself.


Darwin Charles (1809–1882) An English scientist and traveler who created the theory of evolution, together with Alfred Russell proposed the principles of natural selection. Most of his works are devoted to the problem of the origin of species. And as a true traveler, he also learned about new species from a gastronomic point of view (he tasted dishes made from armadillos, ostriches, agoutis, iguanas).


Copeland Herbert Faulkner (1902–1968) An American biologist born in the family of the botanist Edwin Copeland. He proposed, in addition to prokaryotes, to distinguish the kingdom of protists ( Protista , Protoctista ), which included all eukaryotes that do not belong to multicellular animals or higher plants. In Herbert Copeland's system, four kingdoms were distinguished: Monera (small organisms), Protoctista (lower eukaryotes), Animals, and Plants.


194. Linnaeus Carl (1707–1778)
Swedish naturalist (botanist, zoologist, mineralogist) and physician.
He is the author of a unified system of classification of the plant and animal world, introduced precise terminology for describing biological objects, and introduced binary nomenclature into active use. The scientist crossed Lapland alone, covering more than 2,000 km on foot and horseback in 5 months. In Sweden, Linnaeus is valued as one of the creators of the literary Swedish language.


Lunin Nikolay Ivanovich (1854–1937) Physician, researcher, author of the theory of vitamins. He discovered the existence of vitamins through experiments on mice. For many years he worked as a pediatrician and otolaryngologist, was a teacher, and chief physician. For several decades he worked on breeding and improving pointer dogs.


Margulis Lynn (1938–2011) American biologist in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Massachusetts. Her most famous work was the endosymbiotic theory of the origin of eukaryotes and their organelles. At 14 (!) years old, she began studying at the University of Chicago, and at 19 she became the wife of the future astronomer Carl Sagan. Her first, now classic, article “On the Origin of Mitotic Cells” was rejected by 15 journals. In addition to scientific publications, Lynn Margulis published several books explaining science to a popular audience, co-authored with her son, and a collection of short stories.


Otto von Munchausen (1716–1774) German botanist, naturalist, writer, rector of the University of Göttingen. He separated fungi into a separate kingdom, although he grouped them with sponges and corals. He was engaged in applied botany, in particular, he created one of the first English landscape parks in Europe on the territory of his own estate in Schwebber.


Whittaker Robert (1920–1980)
American ecologist. Published a five-kingdom system of the organic world, in which, along with the kingdoms Monera (prokaryotes), Protista or Protoctista (lower eukaryotes), Plantae (plants) and Animalia (animals), the kingdom Fungi (fungi) was distinguished. Whittaker's works gained wide popularity, and the five-kingdom ecological and physiological system he developed became generally recognized.
