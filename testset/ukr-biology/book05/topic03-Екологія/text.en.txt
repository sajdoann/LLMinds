Methods of ecologyEcology has developed many methods during its existence that allow conducting research and obtaining reliable results. Ecological research can be carried out both in the field and in laboratories (Fig. 24.1, p. 91). Ecology uses a large number of research methods that allow it to effectively solve its main tasks: observation; bioindication; experiment; microscopy;
comparison;
description; statistics; X-ray structural analysis; modeling; isoenzyme analysis; monitoring; DNA analysis.


The classical methods of ecology are observation, experiment, and comparison. Statistical methods are widely used to assess the reliability of the data obtained. Of great importance in modern ecology is the modeling method, which allows predicting future changes in ecosystems. Monitoring has proven to be an extremely effective research method - a system of regular periodic observations of certain objects. The data obtained as a result of monitoring studies are the basis for other ecological research methods. Ecological monitoring can be carried out at different levels: global (within the entire planet); national (within a separate state); regional (within a large region of one state or several neighboring states); local (within a small territory); point (near individual sources of pollution or important objects). Another method of ecology is bioindication. The essence of this method is to determine the state of the environment and the impact of various factors on it using living organisms. Bioindication is an easy-to-use method, because it is based mainly on external observations of individual species of organisms (the so-called indicator species or indicator species). The advantage of this method is also that it is integrative. That is, the impact of all factors acting in a certain system is generalized.
Bioindication is also characterized by high sensitivity. With its help,
even insignificant impacts of factors on living organisms can be detected.

Ecological laws Many years of work by ecologists have allowed them to identify many patterns in ecological processes. They were formulated in the form of separate laws. These laws allow us to analyze processes in ecosystems and make predictions for the future. Thanks to them, we can predict the consequences of decisions made and measures taken. The most famous laws of ecology are as follows. The law of optimum - any environmental factor has certain limits of positive influence on living organisms. For example, for a person without clothes, the most comfortable environmental temperature is 24–27 º C. And in the case of an increase or decrease in temperature by 10 º C, the temperature factor will reach the limit of its positive influence. The law of mutual compensation of environmental factors - the absence or deficiency of some environmental factors can be compensated for to a certain extent by other (similar) factors. Thus, in the case of a decrease in the environmental temperature, ensuring normal human life can be carried out due to increased nutrition. Then the additional part of the food will be spent on maintaining body temperature due to biochemical reactions. Liebig's law of minimum - the most significant factor for the organism will be the factor that deviates maximally from its optimal value for this organism. For example, in the conditions of the Far North, the survival of human populations is determined, first of all, by the temperature of the environment. Most of the resources of both individual individuals and the entire population as a whole are spent precisely on overcoming the consequences of low air temperature. . Topic 7

Environmental factors


What environmental factors can affect human life? Can factors of inanimate nature have an impact on humans? What factors ¬
created by humans can have a negative effect on them? How can living organisms affect humans?


Diversity and interaction of environmental factors Environmental factors (ecological factors, environmental factors) are any factors that can affect a living organism or ecological system, in response to the action of which the organism or ecosystem adapts (adapts to the action of the factor). They are decisive factors in determining the species diversity and abundance of individual species in a particular ecosystem. These factors can have a different nature. They are divided into three large groups: biogenic, abiogenic and anthropogenic. In addition, they usually interact with each other, which significantly affects living organisms. Thus, the simultaneous effect on an animal's body of low temperature and high humidity sharply increases the cooling effect, and the combination of low temperature and low humidity, on the contrary, reduces this effect.


Abiogenic factors Abiogenic factors are factors of inanimate nature. They are determined by the physical and chemical conditions of the environment. Abiogenic factors include temperature, humidity, light, movement of air masses (wind), currents and salt


Fig. 25.1. Examples of abiogenic factors: flood, climate, relief


94. Ecology


water content, precipitation, floods, fires, snow cover, the Earth's magnetic field
, terrain relief, etc. (Fig. 25.1). These factors can act on organisms constantly (as relief or climate) or only sometimes (floods, fires, etc.). Depending on the specifics of the changes, ecological factors are divided into periodic (tides), non-periodic (fire) and long-term (climate). Their sudden impact can dramatically change the living conditions of organisms. For example, a volcanic eruption can create new places for organisms to live, or it can destroy an entire ecosystem. The importance of abiogenic factors for living organisms is clearly seen in the example of such an indicator as terrain relief. If the relief is flat, it does not create significant obstacles for the movement of living organisms. Therefore, living organisms of the plains can often develop high running speed and withstand long migrations. The relief allows this. But in the conditions of the mountains, there is no need to maintain high speed over long distances. There is simply nowhere to run. But there is a need to be able to move along steep slopes, rocks and even snowy peaks. In the mountains, you can also get into conditions where it is difficult to breathe due to the thin air. There are sharper temperature drops. Another important abiotic factor is the structure of the soil. This factor is important for all living organisms (animals, plants, fungi, microorganisms). In solid soils, it is more difficult for plants to germinate, but for animals they provide reliable support during movement. Although for those animals that live in the soil itself (moles, earthworms, earthworms), movement becomes difficult. In loose sandy soils, animals grow more easily, but they are poorer in nutrients.


Biogenic factorsBiogenic environmental factors are understood as the influence of some organisms on others (Fig. 25.2). Conventionally, biotic factors can be divided into intraspecific and interspecific. Intraspecific factors


Fig. 25.2. The effect of biogenic factors: predator, parasite, competitor


95
. Topic 7


Fig. 25.3. The effect of anthropogenic factors: pollution, habitat destruction, hunting


are manifested through the influence of individuals of a certain species on each other and competition for various resources. The manifestation of these factors is the struggle for territory, food, sexual partner. Interspecific factors are very diverse. In the process of evolution, several types of interspecific relationships have been formed (competition, predation, parasitism, commensalism, etc.). All of them are interspecific biotic factors. It should be noted that in many cases the effect of intraspecific factors is stronger than interspecific ones. This is due to the fact that individuals of one species have the same environmental needs. Therefore, competition between them for resources (territory, breeding partners, food, etc.) is always more severe than between individuals of different species.


Anthropogenic factors Anthropogenic (anthropic) factors are those caused by human activity. These include environmental pollution, unlimited hunting, habitat destruction, description of new species, etc. (Fig. 25.3). Man began to influence ecosystems quite a long time ago. At a minimum, he actively contributed to the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna by hunting animals, and perhaps was the main cause of this process. But these scales became really large after the beginning of human economic activity, especially after the beginning of the industrial revolution. In the modern world, human activity has become one of the strongest environmental factors that affects all existing ecosystems. However, it cannot be said that anthropogenic factors have only a negative impact. The positive impact of humans on the environment includes the system of environmental protection in different


countries


, the creation of protected areas (reserves, sanctuaries, national parks), etc. In addition, some species have adapted to life alongside humans, and for these organisms, anthropogenic factors are often positive. Thus, domestic animals and cultivated plants have significantly increased their numbers and expanded their habitat with the help of humans. Those organisms that have adapted to life in human settlements have received new habitats with a good food base and reduced pressure from predators. These are species such as swallows, sparrows, cockroaches, weeds, wood-destroying fungi, etc. Humans have also created favorable conditions for their own parasites. The causative agents of human diseases have spread throughout the planet. The same thing happened with pests and pathogens of cultivated plants and domestic animals. These species only benefited from the action of anthropogenic factors..Topic 7


The influence of environmental factors on organisms


26


What types of environmental factors exist? To which type of factor for wild boars can human hunting be attributed? Which species are called stenobionts, and which are ¬
eurybionts? Give two examples of species for each of these groups.


Ecological factors and individual species
The action of environmental factors is decisive for the processes of adaptation
of living organisms. It is through them that environmental conditions influence organisms. Only by adapting to them does a species have a chance of survival. The ability of organisms to withstand adverse environmental conditions is called ecological tolerance. Different organisms can adapt to various deviations of factors from optimal ones. The mechanism of adaptation of species to the action of a factor is natural selection. Due to the diversity of organisms among the descendants, only those who are best adapted to it survive under the influence of a factor. They pass on successful combinations and variants of genes that arose as a result of mutations in response to the action of a certain factor to their descendants. And after several generations, species adapt to the action of this factor. For example, those groups of people who began to live in the conditions of the Far North were forced to switch almost exclusively to meat consumption, because there is practically no plant food there. This caused the adaptation of such groups to a special diet with a high content of meat and fat. And such an adaptation was quite successful, although in the process of adaptation some individuals died in several generations in a row.


Limiting factors The factor that most affects the survival of an organism is called limiting. Depending on the environmental conditions and the systematic group of organisms, various factors can be limiting (even in the conditions of the same ecosystem). For example, in river estuaries, where the salinity of the water changes, salinity will be the limiting factor for fish. And for birds that hunt fish, salinity does not matter. For them, the limiting factor may be the insufficient number of nesting sites located in this estuary.


98. Ecology


Fig. 26.2. Lack of water affects the grouping of ¬
savanna species


Fig. 26.1. The limiting factors of a peat bog are high humidity and an acidic ¬
habitat


Several factors can be limiting at the same time. Thus, in peat bogs, such factors for plants can be considered high humidity of the soil and its high acidity (Fig. 26.1). That is, only those plants that are able to withstand such conditions of existence can survive in such a bog.


Ecological factors and species groups It should be noted that ecological factors affect not only individual species of organisms, but also groups of different species. For example, in dry conditions in the savannah, the number of water sources becomes smaller, and different species of organisms are forced to compete or interact with each other to ensure access to a watering place (Fig. 26.2). Groups of organisms can respond to the action of a factor not only directly, changing the adaptability of specific species. The ratio of individual species within a group can also change. For example, if the climate becomes drier, the number of moisture-loving plant species decreases and the number of drought-resistant ones increases. Topic 7


Populations


27


What levels of organization of living organisms exist? What level ¬
of organization of living organisms forms the totality of all unicellular and multicellular organisms living in one cave? What features are inherent in the organismal,
population-species, and ecosystem levels of organization?


Definition and characteristics of populationsA population is a collection of individuals of the same species that are capable of self- ¬


reproduction over a large number of generations and occupy a certain territory for a long time, functioning and developing in one or more groups of living organisms. In a population, individuals are not independent, but interact with each other. They can compete for resources and unite to increase their chances of survival. In dioecious species, an important part of ecological interaction is the formation of pairs for the reproduction process. Each population has certain characteristics that can be used to determine its state (Fig. 27.1). Static characteristics of populations determine its state at a specific point in time, and dynamic characteristics determine its state over a certain period of time. Population size is the total number of individuals in a certain territory that belong to one population. Population density is defined as the average number of individuals of a species per unit area or volume. For example, if the population size of tits in a park with an area of 25.6 hectares is 256 individuals, then the density of this population is 10 individuals per hectare (Fig. 27.2). Structure is the ratio of groups of organisms in a population according to various characteristics. Depending on the selected characteristic, spatial, sexual, age, genetic and other population structures are distinguished.


Population characteristics

100. Ecology


Fig. 27.2. Species with high population densities


Fertility is the number of new individuals that appear per unit of time as a result of reproduction (Fig. 27.3). Mortality is the number of individuals that die in a population per unit of time. Population growth is the difference between the quantitative indicators of fertility and mortality. If mortality in a population exceeds fertility, then population growth will be negative. Velocity (growth rate) is the average increase in the population per unit of time. The population growth rate is a complex indicator and depends not only on fertility. With low fertility and low mortality, the growth rate may be higher than in the case of high fertility and high mortality. In addition to these indicators, the growth rate of populations can be affected by the migration of organisms.


Population classificationPopulations can be classified according to their spatial and age structures, density, constancy or change in habitat, ability to self-renew, and other ecological criteria.

Population types by ability to reproduce


Population typeType characteristics


IndependentHave high reproductive potential, capable of self-reproduction without the influx of migrants from other populations


Semi-dependentCapable of self-reproduction, but have low reproductive potential due to low numbers. Immigration improves the condition of such populations


DependentBirth rate in such populations is lower than mortality. Can exist for a long time only if there is an influx of migrants from other ¬
populations


Pseudopopulations ¬
Formed by groups of individuals that do not have the opportunity to reproduce due to migration from other populations


Periodic populations Appear outside the species' range or in new biotopes and exist only
if there are favorable conditions. If conditions deteriorate, they disappear, but
can form again when the situation improves


Functional significance of populations in ecosystems Populations are part of ecosystems and perform the function of individual components in them. It is thanks to the functioning of populations that conditions favorable for life on our planet are created. Populations occupy a certain space, build shelters, move, use certain types of food and thereby influence the surrounding nature. The cycle of substances, energy exchange between living and non-living nature depend on populations. The joint activity of populations determines many important properties of biotic communities and ecological systems.


Spatial population structureThe spatial structure of a population is understood as the nature of the distribution of individuals within the territory of residence. It can be different (Fig. 27.4). A uniform structure is observed in populations of organisms whose individuals are distributed evenly throughout the range. But such a structure occurs quite rarely and mainly in microorganisms. In most cases, individuals of a population are distributed unevenly across the territory of residence. They form clusters in places most favorable for habitation, and are rarely found in other areas of the range. A uniform population structure is also often used in ecosystems of artificial origin (agrocenoses). Such a distribution of individuals can be observed in forest plantations, on agricultural fields


102. Ecology


Fig. 27.4. Uniform, random and aggregated (in groups) distribution of individuals of a population
in the space of


Podar crops, in greenhouses, in places where apiaries are located near the field. The main reason for this is technological. To ensure the normal functioning of populations in agrocenoses, a person must regularly care for them. And it is most convenient to do this in the case of a uniform spatial distribution of individuals in the population. The spatial structure of a population can change over time. For example, if the river bed changes, it can wash away the banks and form new steep slopes where there were none before. This allows shore swallows to form new colonies and changes the spatial structure of the population of this species. The drying out of a group of trees can create new foci in the populations of wood-destroying fungi and insects that live in dead wood. Over time, the spatial structure of populations also changes in agrocenoses. This can be observed very well in the example of parks or forest plantations. Over the many years of the existence of such agrocenoses, their structure becomes less and less regular as a result of the death of some individuals or human economic activity. Topic 7

Age and sex structure of the population
The ratio of male to female sexes in a population has important ecological significance. It is directly related to its reproductive potential. The sex ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of males to the number of females or the number of males to the total number of males and females. A very important indicator for a population is its age structure. This is the ratio of the number of individuals of different age classes and generations. The population does not necessarily have to consist of individuals of different ages. For example, all individuals in populations of annual plants are the same age. The sex and age structure of a population reflect its ability to reproduce (Fig. 28.1). For example, if the population is dominated by old individuals or very few females, the population will not increase rapidly. The ratio of male to female sexes in a population has important ecological significance, since it is directly related to its reproductive potential, and therefore, its impact on the life of the entire ecosystem. The age structure of populations of different species can differ significantly from each other (Fig. 28.2). This is due to the peculiarities of the life of the species and their reproduction strategy. In species that give birth to a large number of offspring, but almost no

care for them, the largest number of individuals will be young. But at a young age, such species also have the highest chances of death. But after the organism becomes an adult, its chances of death decrease significantly. Such a population structure is characteristic of many species of fish, mollusks, amphibians. In the case when the birth rate is low and care for offspring is significant (elephants, whales,
etc.), the number of young individuals
in the population is small and middle-aged individuals predominate. In species for which the chances of death do not depend on the age of the animal, the number of individuals decreases evenly with age (hydras, cockroaches, bedbugs, etc.).


The number of men in Ukraine as of January 1, 2018 was 19,558.2 thousand people, and women - 22,658.6 thousand. A population structure has formed in Ukraine, which is characterized by a high proportion of older people and a low proportion of younger people. As of January 1, 2018, the number of people aged 0–15 years was 16.3% of the total number of permanent residents ¬
, aged 60 and older - 22.9%, aged 16–59 years - 60.8%. (According to the website ukrstat.org)


Regulation of population density and size


Population size and density are important indicators for their existence. The growth of these indicators indicates the well-being of the population. But unlimited population growth is impossible. After reaching a certain number, the population completely exhausts the resource necessary for its existence. This can be food, drinking water, a nesting site, etc. The depletion of resources increases intraspecific competition and causes an increase in the mortality of individuals. Complete depletion of resources can cause the death of the population. Therefore, in natural populations of organisms there are mechanisms for regulating their number and maintaining it at an optimal level. These mechanisms can be both intraspecific (reduction in fertility due to hormonal changes) and occur at the ecosystem level.


105. Topic 7


Fig. 28.3. Predators and parasites are one of the most effective mechanisms for regulating
population size


At the ecosystem level, population regulation is carried out mainly due to the action of predators and parasites on individuals of the species. The more individuals of a species, the more food for predators and parasites, which stimulates their reproduction. An example of such a regulator is trypanosome, which is a parasite, for example, of ungulates in the southern regions of Africa (Fig. 28.3). Living organisms also use other methods of population regulation (Fig. 28.4). The most common is regulation with the help of other species (primarily predators and parasites). In addition, migration is an effective mechanism, when part of the individuals of the population moves to other areas. In some cases, animals can regulate the number of their populations by cannibalism (eating individuals of their own species). Regulation at the hormonal level is also possible, when instinctive programs for limiting reproduction begin to work and some individuals do not leave descendants due to disturbances in the functioning of the reproductive system of the organism. In some cases, humans are faced with the problem of regulating or controlling the population of organisms that have been artificially introduced into new regions. An example of such situations is the mass reproduction of rabbits and the territory of Australia. They were brought to the new continent in the 19th century. It was planned to use them as an object of hunting. But the lack of natural regulators of the population caused a very intensive reproduction of this species. This caused a significant disruption of local biocenoses and caused significant damage to Australian farms. Mechanical control measures - hunting rabbits and building fences against their penetration - were ineffective. Effective success was achieved only at the expense of natural regulators of the population of these species, which had to be artificially imported. The number of rabbits was reduced by infecting them with the myxomatosis virus. But later they began to develop resistance to this


disease


and


another virus was used to further regulate the number of their population.


Minimum viable population For each species of organisms, there is a certain minimum population size that is capable of maintaining its number at a stable level. A population of this size is called the minimum viable population. For each individual species, the size of such a population is determined individually. The size of such a population is influenced by both the sexual and spatial structure of the species, its ability to migrate and form dense settlements within its range. Determining this indicator is extremely relevant for the protection of endangered species, because it allows for a more realistic calculation of the risks of extinction for specific species. Topic 7


29 Ecosystems


How do living organisms obtain energy for their vital activity? How do the processes of ¬
obtaining energy differ in plants, animals and fungi? What organisms are ¬
called chemoautotrophs and to which domains of cellular organisms can they belong?


The cycle of substances in an ecosystem An ecosystem is a set of living organisms that live in a certain habitat and form a single whole with it. Any ecosystem contains two main components - biotic and abiotic. The biotic component of an ecosystem is all living organisms that are part of it (animals, plants, bacteria, etc.).
And the abiotic component is the components of inanimate nature (stones, water, air,
etc.). Ecosystems are natural (ecosystems of a forest, lake, desert) and artificial (garden, vegetable garden, aquarium). In the biosphere, there is a constant cycle of elements that pass ¬


from organism to organism, into inanimate nature and back to the organism. Elements that are released by microorganisms, for example, during decay, enter the soil and atmosphere, again participating in the cycle of substances in the biosphere, being absorbed by living organisms. For the functioning of ecosystems, the most important are the cycles of elements that are the main components of living organisms - Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Sulfur, Phosphorus.


Properties of ecosystemsThe main properties of ecosystems are integrity, stability, self-reproduction and self-regulation, etc. Integrity - the ability to maintain relationships between ecosystem components and with the natural environment, primarily through the flows of matter and energy. If some substances are removed from the cycle (and the flow of energy is interrupted with them), the integrity of the ecosystem is disrupted and it may die. Ecosystem stability - the ability to maintain its structure and functional features under the influence of external factors (for example, rain or wind do not disrupt the structure and functioning of the ecosystem


108.


Forest ecology). The most stable ecosystems are those that have a rich species composition (for example, the ecosystem of a tropical forest). The least stable are those that are artificially created (for example, garden or aquarium ecosystems); without human support, they cannot exist at all. The self-reproduction of an ecosystem is its ability to exist for a long time, maintaining its composition and functioning. For the long-term existence
of any ecosystem, it is necessary that all
its resources are constantly reproduced in it: organisms, the composition of soil and water, oxygen in the air, etc. In order for organisms to constantly reproduce, conditions for their existence are necessary (food sources, water, solar energy, etc.). Within any ecosystem, for example, old individuals are constantly replaced by young ones, sick ones by healthy ones. All this is possible only if self-reproduction is timely. The self-regulation of an ecosystem means its ability to independently “manage” life within the ecosystem in order to ensure its long-term existence. For example, predators can eat herbivores of a certain species until their number decreases. Then, if there is a diversity of species, they switch to another food source (for example, to another species of herbivore). Thus, they do not completely destroy the species, but only leave it alone until its numbers recover.


An interesting fact happened in Germany. Local residents cut down a forest on one of the slopes ¬
of the Spessart mountain range. And then they decided to restore it. The trees that used to grow there - oaks - for some reason did not take root. Then it turned out that along with the trees, deer were also destroyed, whose droppings played an important role in the forest ecosystem. Organisms that lived in the soil "recycled" it and thereby maintained a certain composition. After the destruction of the forest, the composition of the soil changed, and the trees that were there before could no longer grow there.


Relationships between populations in ecosystemsAccording to the method of obtaining organic substances, living organisms in ecosystems are divided into ecological groups: producers, consumers and decomposers. Producers are autotrophic organisms that produce organic substances (Fig. 29.1, p. 110). These include, for example, trees, algae and other plants. Consumers are heterotrophic organisms in ecosystems that obtain organic substances by feeding on other living organisms (Fig. 29.2, p. 110). They can consume both producers (for example, herbivores) and other consumers (such as predators that eat herbivores). Reducers are heterotrophic organisms of ecosystems that obtain organic substances by feeding on the remains of living organisms or


109
. Topic 7


Fig. 29.1. Producers (moss and blueberries)


products of their vital activity. Reducers convert dead organic matter into simple organic and inorganic substances. Populations of species from different ecological groups can interact with each other in different ways. The main type of relationship between them is trophic (food). Thus, consumers eat producers and sometimes reducers. And reducers use the remains of dead producers and consumers for their nutrition. The remains of organisms converted by reducers into inorganic substances can be used by producers to build their bodies. Competitive relations are also possible between organisms from the same or different groups if they consume the same resources.


Energy transfer and distribution in ecosystemsEating each other, living organisms become links in food chains. A food chain is a relationship between organisms during the transfer of food energy from its source (autotrophic organism) through a series of organisms, which occurs by eating some organisms by others (Fig. 29.3). In a food chain, each species occupies a certain link. The relationships between species in this chain are called trophic, and the links are

Fig. 29.3. Energy in ecosystems passes through food chains


by trophic levels. At the beginning of food chains, as a rule, there are producers, that is, autotrophic organisms that produce organic substances. The following links in the chain are consumers. Depending on the location of the link, consumers of different orders are distinguished. Thus, herbivores that consume producers are consumers of the first order. Predators that eat herbivores are consumers of the second order. And parasites that live in the body of predators are consumers of the third order. Reducers destroy dead remains and waste products of organisms of all trophic levels. Autotrophic organisms store energy in organic matter, which is used by heterotrophs. During the transfer of this energy from link to link of the trophic chain, the majority of it (80–90%) is lost in the form of heat. In any ecosystem, different food chains do not exist separately from each other, but intersect with each other, creating a trophic web. This is because organisms of a certain species can be links of different trophic chains..Topic 7


30Ecological successions


What is a biocenosis? What factors can influence the change in the species composition of an ecosystem? What ecological groups of ¬
organisms are included in ecosystems? How
can living organisms from different ecological groups interact with each other
within a particular ecosystem?


Successions as processes of self-development of ecosystems Ecosystems cannot exist indefinitely. In some cases, their existence can be millions of years, but then environmental conditions inevitably change. Continents move across the surface of the planet. Processes of mountain formation and land subsidence occur. The climate changes, catastrophic events occur (fires, volcanic eruptions, floods, etc.). All this forces ecosystems to change and change the species composition of their biocenoses, forming new ones. The process of gradual, regular and irreversible change of biocenoses in a certain area of the territory is called succession. Succession is a normal process that occurs in natural ecosystems and is associated with changing living conditions. The final stage of any succession is the formation of the so-called climax ecosystem, which is the most optimal for certain environmental conditions. The composition of the climax ecosystem is determined by a combination of many factors, primarily climatic. The development of succession occurs in several stages: the formation of a suitable area of the earth's surface; the settlement of the area by the first species of organisms; the intensification of interspecific competition and the displacement of some species; the growth of biodiversity and the formation of a stable ecosystem. Primary successions Primary successions arise in those areas of the territory where no ecosystems existed before. Their formation occurs in parallel with the process of soil formation and at the first stages with rather low competition between organisms. An example of primary succession is the settlement by organisms of new islands or land areas formed by processes occurring in nature or due to human activity (Fig. 30.1).


112. Ecology


Fig. 30.1. Formation of a place for primary
succession due to the action of natural factors Fig. 30.2. Creation of conditions for secondary succession


Primary successions in modern ecosystems occur infrequently. But each of the modern areas of the earth's surface once went through primary succession.


Secondary successions Secondary succession occurs when soil, seeds of the previous biocenosis and, possibly, microorganisms, larvae, cysts, etc. are preserved on its territory. That is why, already at the first stages of secondary succession, competition between organisms is quite significant. Secondary successions arise in conditions of partial (although possibly very strong) destruction of the previous ecosystem (Fig. 30.2). Such a situation can arise as a result of deforestation, floods, fires, etc. After the exploitation of agricultural lands ceases, secondary succession also occurs on them. Topic 7


31 Agrocenoses


What is a system? Why are both an individual organism and a population ¬
systems? What is an ecosystem? What artificial ecosystems ¬
can humans create? What factors can affect the yield of agricultural crops? How can humans increase their yield?


Structure of agrocenoses
Artificial ecosystems are often considered as a separate type of ecosystem
(agrocenoses). They are created by humans and used by them for economic purposes (Fig. 31.1). Agrocenoses include fields of agricultural crops, vegetable gardens, greenhouses, orchards, sea farms, vineyards, parks, etc. Agrocenoses contain the same ecological groups of organisms as natural ecosystems—producers, consumers, and decomposers. But in them, one species significantly predominates in terms of the number of individuals. Agrocenoses are created for humans to obtain products from this species. Consumers in agrocenoses are represented by humans and pests and pathogens of the species that is the object of cultivation. In fact, pests and pathogens are competitors of humans for the consumption of resources of a certain agrocenose. Features of the functioning of agrocenoses


Such ecosystems cannot exist without human support. Organisms of one species predominate in them, and they are not capable of self-regulation or such ability is weak. The regulation of these systems is carried out by humans. The main method of regulation is the elimination of competing species and the creation of favorable conditions for the growth of useful species. This is achieved


either


by


agrotechnical methods (soil cultivation to preserve moisture,
snow retention, weeding, etc.), or by the use of chemical preparations (herbicides, fungicides, acaricides, rodenticides, etc.). The regulation of processes in agrocenoses is complicated by the fact that the presence of a large number of individuals of one species, also located at high density, creates favorable conditions for the spread of pests and diseases. For representatives of these species, agrocenoses are a huge food resource, the presence of which provides good opportunities for their rapid reproduction. And another factor affects this process. The genetic diversity of cultivated organisms is less than that of wild species. The reason for this is the strict selection for human use of only certain genetic variants. Therefore, it is much easier for any pathogen to adapt to the defense systems of cultivated species.


Increasing the productivity of agrocenoses A person constantly removes substances from agrocenoses (when consuming products grown in them). Therefore, these substances have to be constantly renewed (for example, by applying fertilizers). Without applying fertilizers, the productivity of agrocenoses decreases significantly over several years. Both natural and synthetic fertilizers can be used for agrocenoses. Each of these types of fertilizers has its advantages and disadvantages. In addition to applying fertilizers, there are other ways to increase the productivity of agrocenoses. First of all, this is breeding work, which allows you to obtain plant varieties and animal breeds with significantly higher productivity. In addition, crop rotation technology is of great importance. By alternating different agrocenoses in the same territory, it is possible to maintain the overall productivity of such a system for a long time and with high efficiency..Topic 7

What is an ecosystem? Is the Black Sea an ecosystem?
What are the features of the biospheric level of organization of living things?
Can ecosystems from different parts of the planet interact with each other? What organisms are producers, consumers ¬
and decomposers?


Structure and boundaries of the biosphereAs you already know, the biosphere is one of the shells of the Earth, a global ecosystem that unites all the ecosystems of our planet. The concept of "biosphere" (from the Greek. bios - life) was proposed in 1875 by the Austrian geologist E. Suess. The doctrine of the biosphere as a special part of the Earth inhabited by living organisms was formulated by the Ukrainian scientist V. I. Vernadsky, although the French biologist J.-B. Lamarck. The biosphere does not form a separate shell of the Earth, but is part of the geological shells of the globe inhabited by living organisms. It occupies the upper part of the lithosphere, the entire hydrosphere and the lower layer of the atmosphere. It is the only global ecosystem of the highest order. The biosphere consists of four main components: living matter; biogenic matter; inert matter; bioinert matter. Living matter includes all living organisms (bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, etc.), and biogenic matter includes all matter created or processed by living organisms (coal, peat, oxygen, etc.). Inert matter was formed without the participation of living organisms (basalt, granite, etc.), and bioinert matter is created with the simultaneous participation of living organisms and factors of inanimate nature (soil, silt, etc.).


The main biomes of the Earth The basis of the Earth's biosphere is made up of large associations of ecosystems of its natural and climatic zones, which are called biomes. There are several classifications of biomes. As a rule, aquatic and terrestrial biomes are considered separately (Fig. 32.1).

Classification of terrestrial biomes


BiomeCharacteristics


TundraThe biome of the circumpolar regions is located in the permafrost zone. There are no forests, the vegetation is mainly herbaceous, formed by mosses, lichens ¬
and low-growing grasses and small shrubs.


Coniferous forestsThe biome is formed mainly by coniferous forests without admixtures or with small to large patches of deciduous species. It is located mainly in regions with a temperate or continental climate. A significant part of such forests in some regions of the planet is of ¬
artificial ¬
origin. Deciduous forests The


biome


is formed mainly by deciduous forests that shed their leaves before the onset of the cold season. It is usually located closer to the equator, compared to coniferous forests. Differs from coniferous forests in greater species diversity


Tropical
forests The biome is located in the tropical zone of the planet in places with high humidity and high year-round air temperatures. They have the highest species diversity ¬
among biomes


Steppes The biome of the temperate zone of the northern and southern hemispheres, which is characterized by the dominance of herbaceous vegetation and less precipitation than for forest ¬
biomes


Deserts Biomes with a significant deficit of moisture, inhabited by organisms that have adapted to xerophytic conditions of existence. They are characterized by a very low density of organisms and sparse vegetation cover. The snow deserts of the Arctic and Antarctic are often defined as a separate type of desert


Based on salinity, aquatic biomes are divided into saltwater and freshwater biomes. Among the freshwater biomes, there are still and flowing water biomes (Fig. 32.2, p. 118), and saltwater biomes are divided into coastal and oceanic. An important indicator that determines the characteristics of aquatic biomes is the oxygen saturation of water. The highest oxygen saturation in freshwater biomes is characteristic of shallow rivers with a fast flow. In standing


117. Topic 7


Fig. 32.2. Some freshwater biomes: rivers with a fast and slow flow and a standing reservoir


, the oxygen content is the lowest. Due to the lack of oxygen, a large number of anaerobic microorganisms live in such biomes
. In marine ecosystems, the presence of biomes with a low level of oxygen content is also possible. But it occurs under specific conditions. For example, the deep-water part of the Black Sea is anoxic. Another important indicator for aquatic biomes is the availability of nutrients and minerals. In most cases, they enter ¬
the biome from coastal ecosystems or rise with upwelling currents from deeper areas of the ocean. In those parts of aquatic biomes where such an influx of substances is practically absent, the diversity of living organisms is low, and their number is very small.


Key biogeochemical cycles Like any other ecosystem, the biosphere can exist only due to continuous flows of matter and energy that pass through it and are formed within it. One of the main such flows is the biogeochemical cycles of chemical elements. They are a necessary condition for the existence of the entire biosphere, because the elements of these cycles are part of living organisms. Their continuous use by organisms without the existence of circulation cycles would very quickly exhaust the planet's resources and make life on Earth impossible. The main elements that participate in biogeochemical cycles are Nitrogen, Sulfur, Phosphorus, Carbon, etc. (Fig. 32.3). These cycles are based on the processes of obtaining the necessary elements by living organisms, their use by them, the movement of these elements along trophic chains to reducers, and the return of elements by reducers to non-living components of ecosystems. In all biogeochemical cycles, there are both processes carried out by living organisms and processes of modification and migration of inorganic substances. For example, in the Nitrogen cycle, the main source of

of


its compounds for biocenoses is atmospheric nitrogen. Nitrogen from nitrogen can be converted into a form suitable for consumption by organisms in two ways - due to the activity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms and under the influence of lightning. Carbon dioxide is formed as a result of the respiration of living organisms and during the decomposition of dead organic matter. But it can also enter the atmosphere as part of volcanic gases. Human activity has a significant impact on biogeochemical cycles. Thus, a significant part of Carbon in previous geological eras was removed from the cycle in the form of coal deposits. But man began to actively use these reserves as fuel. This caused intensive emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and, as a result, the inclusion of previously extracted reserves of Carbon in modern biogeochemical processes. Topic 7


V. Vernadsky's teachings
on the biosphere and noosphere


33


How does man affect the biosphere of our planet? Why has man's influence on the biosphere increased significantly over the past few hundred years? How can changes in the biosphere ¬
affect human life? Can domestic animals affect the state of the biosphere?


The concept of the noosphere V. I. Vernadsky predicted in the first half of the 20th century that the biosphere would develop into the noosphere (the term was proposed in 1927 by French scientists E. Leroy and P. T. de Chardin). Initially, V. I. Vernadsky considered the noosphere (from the Greek. noos - mind) as a special "mental" shell of the Earth, developing outside the biosphere. However, he later came to the conclusion that the noosphere is a certain state of the biosphere, in which human mental activity becomes a determining factor in its development. A characteristic feature of the noosphere is the ecologization of all spheres of human life. A person must approach the solution of any problems from the position of ecological thinking, that is, the preservation and improvement of the state of the natural environment.


Application of ecological laws by man Our planet is unique. This imposes a huge responsibility on humanity as a whole. Because careless human activity can destroy those ecosystems that make the existence of our species on the planet possible. In order not to harm the ecosystem with our activities, it is promising to take into account ecological patterns in all spheres of human life. Understanding these patterns is also of great importance for creating principles of rational use of nature. With their help, it is possible to significantly facilitate the cultivation of agricultural products. They are absolutely necessary for creating systems for
the utilization and processing of waste that are formed as a result of
human activity in various spheres. Knowledge of ecological patterns is important during the reclamation procedures after the use of certain areas of the planet's surface by humans. For example, the restoration of ecosystems after the completion of mineral extraction (Fig. 33.1).

Ways to avoid a global ecological crisis Many technologies are used to protect and preserve the biosphere. To this end, at various levels (scientific, legislative, economic, etc.) a whole range of measures is taken to preserve both individual species and entire ecosystems. Active public work is carried out. The so-called Red Books are created. The Red Book is an approved list of rare and endangered species, which contains brief information about their biology, distribution and protection measures taken. And to preserve ecosystems, nature reserves are allocated. A significant trend in human activity that helps to avoid a global environmental crisis is the development of ecological thinking and drawing attention to problems at the level of governments and international organizations. Their cooperation in the field of preserving and restoring ecosystems can solve a large number of environmental problems.. Basic provisions of the topic "Ecology"

for a long time only due to the influx of migrants from other populations


PseudopopulationsFormed ¬
by groups of individuals that are unable to reproduce
due to migration from other populations


Periodic populationsEmerge outside the species' range or in new biotopes and exist only if favorable conditions are present. When conditions deteriorate, such populations disappear, but can form again if the situation improves

34Modern ecological problems


What is a system? How do the Earth's shells (atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere) interact with each other? What does ecology study? What sections is ecology divided into? What environmental factors can act on living organisms?


Planet Earth is a single large ecosystem Planet Earth has several shells located on its surface. These are the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere. These shells do not exist separately from each other. They closely interact, and processes in one affect the state of the others. A volcanic eruption causes the release of gases and solids (dust) into the atmosphere. From there, together with precipitation, they fall into the hydrosphere and onto land, where they affect organisms that are components of the biosphere. All components of the upper layers of the planet gradually mix and exchange substances and energy with each other. Coal, which millions of years ago formed from dead trees and became part of the lithosphere, is mined by man, that is, it ends up on the surface. Coal burns and forms carbon dioxide, which enters the atmosphere, and then it is again absorbed by plants. Therefore, the consequences of any significant event that occurs on the surface of the planet will sooner or later reach all its corners and will affect the state of the environment. Throwing away a plastic bottle or bag, a person does not think that this can create a big problem. But plastic ends up in rivers, and from them - in the seas and oceans (Fig. 34.1). In the Pacific Ocean,

Environmental problems at different levels An environmental problem is a situation caused by a change in the natural environment, and the consequence is a disruption in the structure and functioning of a natural ecosystem. Their causes can be the action of abiogenic, biogenic and anthropogenic factors. Abiogenic factors that create environmental problems are, for example, volcanic eruptions (especially large ones), asteroid impacts, continental drift, and other geological processes, etc. Biogenic factors that affect ecology can be the invasion of species into new territories, the emergence of successful forms of parasites or pathogens, etc. But the most relevant today are environmental problems that arise under the influence of anthropogenic factors. Environmental problems are divided into three large groups by their scale: local, regional, and global. Local problems have local significance and are relevant for a specific settlement or biocenosis. Regional ones concern a separate region or a certain
