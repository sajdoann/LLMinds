Environmental problems of Ukraine In Ukraine, the imbalance in the interaction of man and nature has caused many problems. Among them are global environmental problems that affect Ukraine in the same way as other regions of the planet. And there are environmental problems of the local level, many of which are particularly
relevant only for certain regions.
The problems of all of Ukraine of the global level can be called pollution of water bodies and soils, soil degradation and deforestation. Air pollution is also relevant for the entire territory of Ukraine (as one of the biggest problems), but the degree of this pollution varies significantly in different regions. Of course, the disposal of household waste is another global world problem that the state must solve (Fig. 34.3). The destruction of steppes is one of the problems that is relevant for certain regions. It is the most acute for the southern regions. The consequences of the Chernobyl disaster are primarily a problem for the north of the country ¬
. Dangerous geological processes (for example, subsidence of the surface

Fig. 34.3. Significant environmental problems of Ukraine: destruction of forests, disposal of household ¬
waste, pollution of soils and water bodies, salinization of


soils, landslides, etc.) occur where mineral extraction was carried out or building regulations were violated. Military operations in the East of the country have caused the destruction of the ecosystem in this region and the emergence of a number of environmental problems. In addition to the direct impact on ecosystems (the action of firearms, mines, military equipment), indirect effects are also of great importance. Thus, the decay products of many explosives are toxic, and fuel and lubricants that enter the soil during the operation or destruction of equipment create local areas of pollution. In many cases, it becomes impossible to carry out technical maintenance of economic and industrial facilities. That is why mines are flooded, the groundwater level changes, hydraulic structures fail, etc. Topic 8

Environmental quality. Pollution criteria


What environmental resources does a person consume? What components of the environment are necessary for a person for normal life ¬
? What factors of the natural and anthropogenic environment have a positive effect on a person, and which ones are negative? What negative ¬
factors does a person create himself?


Environmental qualityEvery person lives in a certain environment. He is a part of it, interacts with its various components, can influence the environment and change it. But the environment also influences a person. And it is very important that this influence is favorable. And it will be favorable if the quality of the environment is high. The Ministry of Health of Ukraine gives the following definition: the quality of the natural environment is the state of natural and human-transformed ecosystems that preserves their ability to constantly exchange substances and energy, as well as reproduce life. It characterizes the suitability of the environment for maintaining human health and is an integrative indicator that summarizes the impact of all possible factors of this environment on a person. If the state of the environment is such that human health is maintained or improved, then this environment is considered healthy or satisfactory. If human health deteriorates because of it, then the state of the environment is characterized as unsatisfactory. And if a person's presence in the environment can lead to serious irreversible consequences, then the state of the environment is considered extreme. In the modern world, the quality of the environment largely depends on the activities of the person himself. Unfortunately, most of the problems that affect human health arise as a result of anthropogenic activity. One of the most dangerous negative factors is environmental pollution by products of human activity.


Environmental pollution
Environmental pollution is the process of changing the composition and properties
of one or more spheres of the Earth (atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere or biosphere) under the influence of a certain factor. Pollution can be natural or anthropogenic. Until the moment when human civilization began to


develop


, environmental pollution was only natural (volcanic eruptions, meteorite falls, the activity of organisms, etc.). But now the largest on the planet is anthropogenic pollution. Anthropogenic pollution is becoming more widespread, covering the entire territory of the planet and affecting everything that it is rich in. It can be both direct (production waste is dumped into a river) and indirect (insecticides get into places where they were not used, through trophic chains).


Pollution criteria In the case of an attempt to assess pollution, the question of criteria arises. What amount of a certain substance is considered pollution? It is clear that a few ammonia molecules in a lake do not create a problem. But how many do? And will it be a problem if the same amount of different substances gets into the water? And what amount will affect different organisms? To solve this issue, the concept of maximum permissible concentration (MPC) was introduced. Maximum permissible concentration is the maximum amount of a harmful substance per unit volume or mass of the environment, which, under the condition of daily exposure for a long time, does not cause changes in the human body, hereditary changes in descendants and does not disrupt the normal reproduction of the main links of a certain ecosystem. The MPC is determined separately for each substance. Its value is established by law and indicated in the relevant standards. MPC are the criteria for pollution. If the content of a harmful substance exceeds the MPC, there is pollution, if not exceeded, there is no pollution..Topic 8

Types of pollution


What are toxic substances? What substances can be toxic to living organisms? How can living organisms avoid poisoning by toxic substances? How can toxic substances be excreted from the human body? What anthropogenic ¬
sources can cause environmental pollution?


Types of environmental pollution Environmental pollution can be very diverse. According to the nature of pollution, three types are distinguished: physical, chemical and biological (Fig. 36.1). What all types have in common is that they change the parameters of the environment. Physical pollution is that which affects the environment by changing its physical parameters. Chemical pollution changes the properties of the environment as a result of the entry into it (into water, soil or air) of various harmful substances (both organic and inorganic nature). Biological pollution occurs in the case

entry into ecosystems of living organisms that are not characteristic of them. Most often, biological pollution is considered to be the introduction of microorganisms (primarily pathogenic) into an ecosystem. But any organisms (in particular, fungi, plants and animals) can negatively affect ecosystems and be biological pollutants. Although some of these types of pollution are not often mentioned in the media, the consequences of their action can be significant. Thus, in the case of thermal pollution of water bodies, the water temperature may increase, which causes its flowering or prevents the spawning of those species of fish that require lower water temperatures during the breeding season. Another problem may arise in those animals in which the sex of the future individual is determined depending on the temperature of embryo development (such as crocodiles). The consequence of thermal pollution of the environment for them is the birth of individuals of only one sex, which poses a threat to the existence of this species. A major problem associated with chemical pollution is the ability of many chemical pollutants to accumulate in organisms and to move over long distances through trophic chains. Therefore, even a small amount of a pollutant in the environment can cause
the death of some organisms due to poisoning.


Sources of environmental pollution As you already know, there are many sources of anthropogenic environmental pollution. They can produce various types of pollution: solid waste, liquid waste, gaseous emissions (Fig. 36.2). Even those power plants that produce electricity from renewable sources are sources of electromagnetic and thermal pollution (although very moderate).


Fig. 36.2. Sources of environmental pollution


131. Topic 8


Fig. 36.3. Electronic device landfill and their organized collection for further recycling


In addition to those sources of pollution that have existed for a very long time (for example, industrial enterprises), new ones are constantly appearing. This is due to the emergence of modern technologies, the development of science and industry. For example, the intensive development of computer technologies quickly makes electronic devices obsolete. And obsolete equipment is disposed of by throwing it into landfills (Fig. 36.3). Due to the presence of harmful substances in such devices, these landfills are often set up in poor countries (for example, African ones), often for a small fee, because this is a cheaper solution than the disposal of obsolete equipment. The disposal of such landfills is usually carried out by incineration, which causes dangerous air and soil pollution. Another big problem is environmental pollution by plastic. Mostly this is disposable tableware and plastic packaging. Plastic is dangerous for the life of many organisms (for example, it
causes the death of whales that swallow it with food). And during
its combustion, very toxic compounds are formed. Significant sources of pollution are settlements. Landfills that are formed near them contain a huge amount of toxic substances that pollute the territory. In some cases, local authorities are trying to solve the problem by exporting household waste abroad to landfills in poor countries. This alleviates the situation in places where garbage is generated, but worsens the state of ecosystems in the countries where it is exported. Everyday life of residents of cities and other settlements requires continuous water supply and, accordingly, the formation of wastewater with a high content of household chemicals. In many countries (especially poor ones) there are problems with systems for treating such wastewater, as a result of which local ecosystems suffer seriously.


132. Sustainable development and rational use of nature


Fig. 36.4. Modern waste processing plants


The need for waste disposal Such a huge production of waste from the level of an ordinary house to the scale of a large industrial complex creates a waste problem. And this waste must be disposed of, because its amount is rapidly increasing. It makes no sense to store it in landfills, because the area for landfills in a short time can exceed the area of the cities near which they are located. The currently widespread practice of burning waste is not the best
option. In the process of its usual
combustion, many toxic substances are formed that pollute the environment and are dangerous to all living things. An effective solution to this problem is modern waste processing plants (Fig. 36.4). Another argument in favor of waste disposal is its value. In fact, from an ecological point of view, there is no waste. There is a huge valuable resource that is not used. Waste contains a large amount of necessary and useful substances. They just need to be removed from there and used again. The most promising would be to create a cycle of substances and energy needed by humans, similar to natural ecosystems, in which substances constantly circulate between individual links, and do not accumulate, forming landfills.

37 Atmospheric pollution and its protection


What substances do plants and animals absorb from the air ¬
and release into it? What pathogens ¬
are transmitted to humans by airborne droplets? Why can the presence of certain substances in the air cause allergies in humans?


Human impact on the atmosphere Atmospheric pollution is one of the largest anthropogenic pollutants. All types of pollutants enter the atmosphere - physical, chemical and biological. The total volume of emissions of all substances annually reaches several billion tons. This often causes a danger to human health. To inform the public about the level of health risk from air pollution, the air quality index (Fig. 37.1) is used. The air quality index is an index that indicates the daily quality of the air. It tells how
clean or polluted the air is and what impact it may
have on health. The degree of danger according to this index is often indicated by a certain color. The main substances that enter the atmosphere in excessive quantities: carbon (IV) oxide CO 2 ; carbon (II) oxide CO ; nitrogen oxides;

134. Sustainable development and rational use of nature


Sulfur oxides; methane; aromatic hydrocarbons; industrial dust, etc.
In addition to emissions of various substances, there is thermal, light
and noise pollution of the atmosphere. The main sources of pollution are industrial production in the field of metallurgy and chemical production, thermal power plants, transport (especially automobile). The atmosphere is significantly polluted by livestock farms (ruminants are one of the largest producers of methane) and landfills (microorganisms in the process of waste processing produce significant amounts of methane, CO 2 and other gases).


You can find out the air quality index anywhere in the world on the website www.airvisual.com. But, unfortunately, information is available from Ukrainian cities only for Kyiv.


Consequences of atmospheric pollution The consequences of atmospheric pollution are very unpleasant. Sulfur and Nitrogen oxides, which enter the atmosphere, interact with water vapor in the air and form acids. This causes the appearance of acid rain (Fig. 37.2). Precipitation with increased acidity worsens the state of ecosystems, results in the degradation of forests and destroys artificial structures (in particular, historical monuments, old houses, etc.).

Another extremely negative consequence of atmospheric pollution is an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in it. The molecules of these gases retain the energy of sunlight, which is reflected from the surface of the planet (Fig. 37.3, p. 135). At high concentrations, heat begins to accumulate in the atmosphere, which is one of the main causes of global warming. The most important greenhouse gases are water, carbon dioxide and methane. Another problem with atmospheric pollution is the destruction of the ozone layer. The ozone layer effectively protects the surface of the planet from ultraviolet radiation, and its damage leads to a sharp increase in the risk of skin cancer and a number of mutations. The state of the ozone layer is also negatively affected by emissions of freons (they are used in refrigerators), which interact with ozone, and by jet flights (ozone is destroyed during the combustion of fuel in their engines).


Smog formation One of the most serious consequences of atmospheric pollution is the formation of smog. Smog is an aerosol consisting of smoke, dust and fog and occurs in large cities in calm weather and a large number of atmospheric emissions (Fig. 37.4). Smog can be formed due to the terrain and the features of urban development, which make it difficult for the wind to blow through the streets and contribute to the concentration of pollutants in a certain area. The formation of smog is caused by exhaust gases from transport and dust that rises during its movement, emissions from heating systems and industrial enterprises. Smog is extremely harmful to human health. Under the influence of


smog, the well-being of those with cardiovascular and allergic diseases, asthma, etc. worsens. Many city dwellers


develop


inflammation of the mucous membranes, the eyes suffer greatly. During smog, the mortality rate of vulnerable categories of the population increases sharply. In addition to harming human health, smog can negatively affect buildings and monuments. Aggressive chemicals that are part of the aerosol accelerate the corrosion of metal elements and worsen the condition of other components of buildings and monuments. To reduce the harmful effects of smog on the body, it is advisable to follow some recommendations: avoid walking in the morning, reduce your stay on the street during this period of the day; limit the time spent outdoors during the smog period; protect the respiratory system (respirator, mask, etc.); periodically rinse your nose and throat with water; keep windows and doors closed, insulate them with a damp cloth; in case of allergies or chronic respiratory diseases, it is advisable to leave the city during the smog period.


Atmosphere protection Both technical and legislative measures are necessary to protect the atmosphere. Its main direction is to reduce the scale of pollution. But measures to protect the atmosphere within one country are ineffective, because all efforts will be in vain due to atmospheric pollution in other countries. Therefore, in 1997, the UN General Assembly adopted a corresponding document that defines and coordinates the work of national governments within the framework of a program to maintain a clean ¬
atmosphere. Also in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted - an international document aimed at regulating greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.

38 Pollution of the hydrosphere and its protection


What substances are absorbed from water by plants and animals ¬
? What problems can arise in plants and animals due to a lack of water? What is the hydrosphere? What components are included in the hydrosphere? What vertebrates live ¬
in the water bodies of your region?


Human impact on the hydrosphere Pollution of the hydrosphere is occurring on an ever-increasing scale (Fig. 38.1). All types of pollution enter the hydrosphere as pollutants - physical, chemical and biological. Depending on the place of pollution, groundwater pollution, freshwater pollution and ocean pollution are distinguished. The main substances that enter the hydrosphere: clay, silt and other substances; petroleum products; salts of heavy metals; surfactants; pesticides; microorganisms (from food production and wastewater); radionuclides; household waste, polyethylene, etc. But human impact on the hydrosphere is not limited to pollution alone. The construction of hydroelectric power plants, canals and dams has caused a sharp change in the water regime of many rivers. The creation of reservoirs


Fig. 38.1. Emissions into reservoirs


138
. Sustainable development and rational use of nature


and drainage of agricultural lands have led to changes in the groundwater level.


Consequences of hydrosphere pollution. Water resource shortage The consequences of human influence on the hydrosphere have affected the state of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. A large number of pollutants caused a mass death of organisms in fresh and salt water bodies. Both animals, plants and microorganisms died. In many cases, the species composition of ecosystems changed significantly. Due to the accumulation of harmful substances in the organisms of representatives of aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial animals also suffered. They ate fish and other aquatic inhabitants and were poisoned by the harmful compounds accumulated in them. Thermal pollution of water bodies with water from the cooling systems of power plants and industrial enterprises complicated the reproduction processes of many species and caused an increase in the number of cases and intensity of water blooms. Dams of hydroelectric power plants blocked the way to spawning grounds for migratory fish. Excessive pollution and disruption of the hydrological regime have significantly increased the scale of another problem - the shortage of drinking water. There is a lot of water on our planet. But most of it is salty or contained in glaciers of polar regions and mountainous areas. And for normal life and economic activity, people need fresh water. In many regions of the planet, water has become the most scarce resource. The shortage of water resources in many southern regions makes it impossible to grow crops and breed animals.


Water bloomThe phenomenon of water bloom occurs as a result of rapid excessive reproduction of algae, a large number of which changes the color of the surface


layers of water in water


bodies


(Fig. 38.2, p. 139). This phenomenon itself can occur without human participation, but agricultural and industrial activities rapidly increase the risk of its occurrence. The reason for this effect is a large number of substances that enter water bodies as a result of anthropogenic activity and create good conditions for the growth and reproduction of algae. Such substances include compounds of Phosphorus, Nitrogen and Carbon. The rapid reproduction of algae leads to their high concentration in the surface layers of water. Some algae die and begin to decompose, binding the oxygen dissolved in the water. This results in the death of many aquatic organisms from suffocation. Some algae can also release toxins into the water, which increases the scale of the death of organisms. In addition to the influx of substances necessary for algae, anthropogenic activity causes water blooms through several other factors. Intensive water intakes cause shallowing of water bodies, and the presence of dams of power plants, bridges and various hydraulic structures slows down the flow. All this contributes to the reproduction of algae and increases the risk of water blooms. The effect of water blooms can also occur as a result of the reproduction of algae from different systematic groups. These include prokaryotic cyanobacteria, various unicellular eukaryotic algae (for example, diatoms), and even large multicellular algae. But in each specific case, a certain species or group of algae species predominates. Water blooms can occur in both salt and fresh water bodies. The color of the water in the event of a bloom depends on which algae are multiplying. It can be green, yellow, brown, red (red tides) or even black.

Assessment of the ecological state of water bodies and protection of the hydrosphere Protection of the hydrosphere requires international efforts and the implementation of a number of both technical and legislative measures. In addition, the main efforts are directed at preventing the ingress of pollutants into the aquatic environment. Widespread implementation of waste-free technologies and the construction of modern effluent treatment complexes are necessary (Fig. 38.3). Effective protection of water resources is impossible without an adequate assessment of the state of the reservoir. But there is no special indicator for this, and the assessment is carried out on the basis of an integrated approach using a system of indicators (physical, chemical, microbiological). Fortunately, world experience shows that successful protection and restoration of water resources is possible. An example of such success is the environmental problem of the Rhine River, one of the largest rivers in Europe. In 1987, an accident occurred in Switzerland, the result of which was the release of a large amount of pesticides and mercury into the Rhine. As a result, there was a problem with water supply in many cities located on the banks of the river, and the death of more than half a million fish. In addition, some fish species have disappeared altogether. This ecological disaster drew attention to the ecological state of the river, which was already extremely unsatisfactory. An international action program was soon developed, which provided for improving the ecological state of the Rhine by the year 2000 in such a way that salmon, which are very sensitive to the presence of pollution in the water, returned to it. The result of the implementation of this program was a reduction in the flow of pollutants into the Rhine in the range of 50 to 100% for various compounds. Salmon returned to the Rhine even earlier than planned
— in 1997.

39 Soil pollution and its protection


What substances do plants and animals absorb from the soil ¬
? What problems can arise in plants due to the deterioration of soil quality? Why is it necessary to add fertilizers to the soil in the process of growing cultivated plants? Can autotrophic organisms grow without soil?


Human impact on soils Soil pollution has become a significant problem for many regions of the planet. Due to irrational human economic activity, all types of pollution — physical, chemical (inorganic and organic) and biological — enter the soil (Fig. 39.1). In addition, soil degradation — the phenomenon of deterioration of the useful properties and fertility of the soil (Fig. 39.2) — has become a major problem. It can be the result of both natural processes and anthropogenic impact. Currently, anthropogenic causes of soil degradation prevail. These are: agricultural activities using outdated agricultural
technologies; deforestation; mining; livestock grazing; unsuccessful land reclamation; pollution with solid household waste; spread of invasive species.

Consequences of human impact on soilsThe consequences of human impact on soils are many, and they are mostly very negative. Under the influence of human actions, wind and water erosion of the soil is intensified. The physical, chemical and biological (and, accordingly, economic) properties of soils deteriorate. Vegetation is destroyed and may disappear for a long time. This significantly increases the processes of soil degradation, which causes a deterioration in their fertility, resulting in a decrease in yields and an increase in food shortages in some regions (for example, in some countries in Africa and Asia). Unsuccessful land reclamation often ends in soil salinization (Fig. 39.3, p. 144). Excessive grazing of livestock destroys the grass cover and causes the destruction of the fertile soil layer through erosion. Deforestation creates problems for the entire region even at distances far from the places of felling.


143. Topic 8


Fig. 39.3. Soil salinization as a result of errors in agricultural activitiesFig. 39.4. Using rational crop rotations to preserve soils


A major problem is man-made accidents and disasters. The result of a typical car accident may be the release of a relatively small amount of fuel and lubricants and battery electrolyte into the soil. Unfortunately, there are many such accidents, and their total contribution to soil pollution is quite significant.
Large-scale accidents at enterprises can cause
terrible consequences. The most significant of such accidents in Ukraine was the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. As a result, vast territories were contaminated with radionuclides. The state of the soil is also adversely affected by hostilities. Explosives, which are widely used, enter the soil, because during any explosion, absolutely complete combustion of the explosive does not occur. In many cases, the combustion products of such substances are also quite toxic. In addition, residues of fuels and lubricants and other substances from destroyed equipment enter the soil, and we should not forget about man-made accidents that accompany hostilities.


Soil protection Soil protection requires international efforts, although it can be effective within the borders of one country. But soil degradation in other countries will still affect the situation, because countries with degraded soils will be threatened with famine. To implement soil protection, a number of both technical and legislative measures should be implemented, when the main efforts are aimed at preventing pollution from entering the soil. It is necessary to


144. Sustainable development and rational use of nature


Fig. 39.5. Tuber bacteria on the roots of legumes enrich the soil ¬
with nitrogen compounds


. The introduction of waste-free technologies and the construction of modern complexes for the purification of emissions are important. An important factor that allows you to maintain and even
restore soil fertility is
the observance of correct crop rotation during the cultivation of agricultural crops (Fig. 39.4). The basis of correct crop rotation is the phenomenon of natural restoration of soil fertility. Considering that soil fertility is created to a large extent due to the activity of living organisms, their correct use can restore this fertility. Correct crop rotation involves the alternation of different crops in certain areas. Some of them can enrich the soil with certain substances (for example, legumes enrich the soil with nitrogen compounds due to the activity of symbiotic bacteria) (Fig. 39.5). In addition, periodic breaks in growing crops (keeping the land "under steam") are of great importance. During such periods, soil microbiocenoses can restore its fertility without hindrance. Methods of soil cultivation, for which special equipment and tools are used, can also have a significant impact on the condition of soils. The correct use of fertilizers (both mineral and organic) is also important. Their use creates optimal conditions for the vital activity of soil biocenosis and plant cultivation. Topic 8


40 Biodiversity and its preservation


What are the largest systematic groups among living organisms? What representatives of mammals live in Ukraine? What groups of spore plants are represented in the flora of Ukraine? Why is the diversity of amphibians much greater in tropical regions compared to circumpolar ones?


Human impact on biodiversity
For a significant part of its evolutionary history, humans have been an ordinary link in savanna ecosystems and have influenced the species composition of these biomes no more than other species. But after the development of technology, the manufacture of more advanced tools and methods of collective hunting, man became a very effective predator. And the extinction of many species at the end of the ice age is associated precisely with the successful hunting of people for these species. A much greater human impact on biodiversity began after the emergence of agriculture. Now species that man did not notice were under anthropogenic pressure. But he expanded the areas under crops and destroyed the habitat of many species. After the beginning of the industrial revolution, the impact on biodiversity increased due to the rapid increase in harmful emissions of production waste. And this became another reason for the extinction of species. The extraction of resources (deforestation, mining, etc.) has a very bad effect on biodiversity. Violation of the hydrological


Fig. 40.1. Examples of negative (deforestation) and positive (ensure free migration) human impact on ecosystems


146. Sustainable development and rational use of nature


Fig. 40.2. The extinct thylacine marsupial wolf


The river regime harms river ecosystems, and the created road system harms terrestrial ecosystems. However, humans can also have a beneficial effect on biodiversity (Fig. 40.1). The creation of nature reserves, artificial reproduction of species that are under
threat of extinction, the preservation
of rare animals in zoos and plants in botanical gardens, the creation of environmental legislation - all these measures support and preserve existing biodiversity. Humans also began to actively exterminate species that they considered their competitors. First of all, this applies to predators that hunted or could potentially hunt domesticated animals. Thus, starting with the emergence of agriculture, the range of wolves was constantly shrinking. And after the settlement of the large island of Tasmania by white settlers, it took about a hundred years for the Tasmanian marsupial wolf to be completely exterminated (Fig. 40.2). Farmers believed that it could be a potential threat to sheep. The development of navigation caused significant damage to the biodiversity of many islands. People settled the islands and easily destroyed the small populations of local animal and plant species. Even if the island was not settled, periodic visits by sailors to it caused damage to the ecosystem, because people did not observe any restrictions on the extermination of animals and plants. In the case of settlement of islands, a great threat to local animals became those animals that were brought to the islands by humans (Fig. 40.3).


Fig. 40.3. Animals brought by humans that destroyed island species of organisms: goats, pigs, rats


147. Topic 8


Pigs, cats, dogs, rats destroyed bird nests, caught and ate adult animals of all local species. The islanders simply did not have time to develop ways to protect themselves from new predators and died en masse. It was a bad idea to bring goats to the islands. On uninhabited islands, they were simply released to live and breed there. And sailors who then sailed to such islands hunted them and stocked up on meat. On islands inhabited by people, goats were kept
as pets. But goats are excellent climbers, they climb
trees and eat leaves. Excessive reproduction of this species without controlling predators has turned many islands into bare rocks with almost no vegetation, which led to the devastation and death of other species.


Acclimatization and re-acclimatization of species Human impact on biodiversity can also be indirect. Due to the movement (purposeful or accidental) of species by humans to new regions, problems can arise for native species from invasive species. The settlement of species in new territories is called introduction. During introduction, organisms adapt to the climatic conditions of new regions. This process is called acclimatization. An example of acclimatization is the cultivation of corn and sunflower (plants native to America) and other species in Ukraine (Fig. 40.4). If the organism once lived in this region and its introduction was repeated, then such a process is called reacclimatization. For example, during the Pleistocene extinction of megafauna, musk oxen became extinct in northern Eurasia, but survived in northern North America. This species was reintroduced to Eurasia, and it began to spread through the territories where it lived before.


Fig. 40.4. American species that were acclimatized in Ukraine: sunflower, muskrat, and robinia (white acacia)


148. Sustainable development and rational use of nature


The main reason for reacclimatization is an attempt to restore lost biodiversity. The appearance of reintroduced species allows us to restore lost connections between species in ecosystems. In addition, it can also have an economic effect if such species can be used by humans.


The need to preserve biodiversity Biodiversity is a very valuable resource of our planet. The presence of a large number of species makes connections in ecosystems more diverse. Diverse connections and branched trophic webs increase the resistance of ecosystems to external influences. Therefore, the preservation of individual species increases the resistance of the entire ecosystem, and their extinction, on the contrary, reduces this resistance. In addition, many organisms can produce substances important to humans, the value of which is still unknown, but may become necessary for future generations. For example, substances obtained from the ginkgo tree are now widely used in pharmacological preparations. But this plant once almost completely died out and has survived only in artificial cultivation. If ginkgo had not been grown as an ornamental plant in ancient times, we would not have received a whole range of useful medicinal products.


The Mauritian dodo (or dodo) was first described in 1598 on the island of Mauritius ¬
. It took less than a hundred years to exterminate it. This large (up to 20 kg) flightless representative of the pigeon family was hunted for meat. And the bird's nests were destroyed by pigs and dogs that were brought to the island. Topic 8


41 Nature Conservation in Ukraine


What species of animals and plants listed in the Red Book of ¬
Ukraine are in your region? What measures should be taken to protect these species? What environmental problems are most relevant for your region and how can they be solved?


Ecological state of the territory of Ukraine
The ecological state of the territory of Ukraine is characterized by the presence of
both common problems for the entire territory and a large number of regional features. The problems of the entire territory of the country are significant anthropogenic load, insufficient number and quality of treatment facilities, irrational use of nature in many sectors of the economy, etc. Specific regional problems include pollution with certain harmful substances (they are different for different regions). Thus, the area around the Chernobyl accident site is characterized by contamination with radionuclides, and regions with a high concentration of industrial production (Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia) - with heavy metals. The Carpathian region suffers from excessive deforestation of mountain forests and, accordingly, increased erosion processes and floods. The southern regions have a problem of water resource shortage. In the east of the country, military operations pose a serious environmental danger.


Nature protection areas The main direction of nature protection in Ukraine, as in the whole world, remains the maximum possible preservation of natural ecosystems, protection of biodiversity, and reduction of the level of anthropogenic impact on nature. Promising directions are the creation of waste-free production, waste recycling and rational use of nature. And another relevant direction is the use of alternative energy sources. Modern nature protection is built on an integrated approach, when all components of the environment are protected. Hunting for a certain species of animal can be banned. But this will not make sense if


150. Sustainable development and rational use of nature


habitats of this species are destroyed. It will still become extinct, but a little later. If you preserve the habitats, but destroy the species that this animal feeds on, or bring emissions into the water it drinks to a toxic level,
the result will be the same - extinction.


Environmental legislation In Ukraine, a system of laws and regulations has been created that ensure the protection of nature. The use of natural resources is subject to state protection and regulation. At the legislative level, activities that may adversely affect the condition of soils, air, water bodies or destroy animals and plants or valuable natural objects are prohibited. Ukraine has also concluded a number of international agreements in the field of environmental protection. To preserve biodiversity, nature conservation areas (reserves, natural parks, nature reserves, natural monuments, etc.) have been created and several state documents have been approved. One of such documents is the Red Book of Ukraine - an official list of species and subspecies of organisms that are under threat of extinction in the territory of Ukraine. Another list has also been created - the Green Book of Ukraine. It contains a list of rare and typical natural plant groups (over 120) that require protection in the territory of Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is also a so-called "black" list of species. This is a list of species of organisms that have become extinct in our time (starting from 1600). Currently, more than 800 species are included in this list.


The first Red Book in Ukraine was published in 1980 (Red Book of the Ukrainian ¬
SSR). In 1994, the Red Book of Ukraine was published. The next edition was published in 2009. It included 542 species of animals and 826 species of plants and fungi..Topic 8


42The concept of sustainable development


What are the global environmental problems? Why are the efforts of ¬
individual countries insufficient to solve global problems? Why can deforestation of the Amazon in
Brazil affect the environmental situation in ¬
Europe?


Sustainable development Throughout its history, the development of mankind has occurred mainly in an extensive way due to the expansion of areas of residence and economic activity and an increase in the amount of resources consumed. But now the usual type of development has become impossible due to the limitations of many of our planet's resources. There is a need to transition to sustainable development. Sustainable development is the development of mankind, which takes into account a large number of factors that affect both society and nature. The use of modern information technologies and process modeling allows us to predict the consequences of decisions made with sufficient accuracy. This makes such development manageable and allows for effective planning of human activities.


The concept of sustainable development The concept of sustainable development was formulated in the decisions of the UN Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992). At this conference, the heads of 179 states adopted an action plan for sustainable development, which was called the "Agenda for the 21st Century". It was adopted in connection with the rapid deterioration of the environmental situation and the forecast of a possible global catastrophe in the 21st century, which could lead to the death of all living things on the planet. Humanity faced an acute contradiction between constantly growing human needs and the inability of the biosphere to provide them. The concept of sustainable development provides for a positive synthesis and a systematic solution to the environmental, economic, social and cultural problems of our time. The main idea of the Concept was that development should meet the needs of the present generation without harming future generations.


152. Sustainable development and rational use of nature


Nature use is considered within the framework of the Concept as a process that cannot but take place. And this is logical, because for its existence, man must use natural resources. But the planet's resources are limited, and they should be used in such a way as to maintain balance and be able to restore them. After all, we cannot leave future generations without any resources for life.


Implementation of the concept of sustainable development The concept of sustainable development is being actively implemented. There are quite a few examples of the implementation of its components and basic approaches. It is implemented in the spheres of economy, society, transport, management, energy conservation, emission control, waste processing, etc. (Fig. 42.1). Thus, during the construction of roads in many countries, according to the Concept, additional green spaces are planted. Thus, the withdrawal of part of the ecosystem territory for human needs is compensated and the state of the environment is preserved. Another important point is the cultivation of grain crops. In traditional agriculture, grain cultivation is accompanied by significant soil depletion. To prevent this, the latest agricultural technologies are used. Thus, the yield is slightly reduced, and soil fertility is gradually restored. In addition to modern methods of soil cultivation, the latest agricultural technologies provide for rational irrigation (for example, drip irrigation). Such irrigation allows you to significantly save water resources, the deficit of which is becoming increasingly large. Another important component is the rational use of fertilizers. It is impossible to do without fertilizers in agrocenoses, because part of the resources

is annually removed from a certain biocenosis along with the harvest. But the ways of applying fertilizers can be different. And the effectiveness
of the application can be different. If too little fertilizer is applied, the yield will decrease, if
too much, there will be a threat of soil and water pollution. Modern agricultural ¬
technologies make it possible to prevent the emergence of such problems.


Sustainable development is a common problem One of the most important ways to implement the Sustainable Development Concept is to change the attitude of the population to the problems that this Concept is trying to solve. The Concept cannot be implemented without understanding that all ideas will not work without their acceptance by the population. It is impossible to force people to sort garbage if they do not understand the need for it. It is impossible to implement energy-saving technologies if voters do not support those politicians who want to adopt the relevant laws. It is impossible to preserve biodiversity if society does not condemn those who destroy it. Every person on the planet must understand that without their specific small contribution, it will be extremely difficult, or perhaps even impossible, to implement this Concept in life. The implementation of sustainable development tasks can be carried out at different levels. But all these levels require close cooperation between different people. Only the scale of this cooperation differs. The simplest cooperation takes place at the family level, when people jointly make decisions about separate garbage collection or insulation of their own home. Although even at this level mutual understanding and the ability to act together are required. Solving problems for the implementation of the Concept of Sustainable Development at the level of local communities, individual houses or settlements is more difficult. In this case, success is impossible without the participation of local governments and the interaction of a large number of people. But the results will also be more extensive. It already becomes possible when


Fig. 42.2. Implementation of the concept of sustainable development at the local level


154. Sustainable development and rational use of nature


making decisions on the processing of household waste, construction of treatment
facilities, educational work in the field of ecology, etc. (Fig. 42.2). At the level of individual states or large regions of the state, information analysis and decision-making occurs through legislative and executive authorities. And direct influence on them by the population is possible through the mechanism of elections and the system of public relations. At this stage, the role of experts in the field of ecology increases significantly, because not always existing problems have a simple and obvious solution. At the international level, cooperation to implement the Concept of Sustainable Development is needed for the implementation of large projects, such as cleaning large rivers, economic and environmental policies within the continent and the entire planet, etc. At this level, making important decisions without high-quality environmental expertise by several groups of different specialists is deadly dangerous.


State standards A modern example of the implementation of the Concept of Sustainable Development at the state level can be the issue of adopting environmental standards that regulate the content of harmful substances in exhaust gases. Such standards have been in force in European countries since 1988. The latest adopted standard is Euro-6, which came into force in 2015. According to this standard, carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars should not exceed 130 g per kilometer. Such requirements of the standard force car manufacturers to change their design, improve the fuel efficiency of engines, and search for new types of fuel and principles of engine operation. Such solutions not only improve the environmental situation in the country, but also stimulate the development of modern technologies..Topic 8


43 Ecological thinking


What is rational use of nature? Why is ¬
the possibility of further existence of humanity often associated
with the Concept of Sustainable Development? What are the negative ¬
consequences of human influence on nature? Can human knowledge influence human behavior in relation to nature?


The need for ecological knowledge The phrase “Ignorance of the law does not exempt from responsibility” is particularly relevant when considering ecological knowledge. It is possible not to know the laws of ecology and the peculiarities of interactions in ecosystems, but then one should be prepared for a situation when action without taking such a law into account will cause catastrophic consequences. There are many examples of this in the history of mankind. For example, in the middle of the 20th century, the prevailing opinion in the Soviet Union was that birds of prey prevented hunters from hunting game en masse. Therefore, a campaign was launched under the slogan “Kill the Birds of Prey.” But environmental laws cannot be canceled by political decree. The destruction of birds of prey caused the massive reproduction of rodents, the number of which they controlled. As a result, enormous crop losses and a new campaign under the slogan “Take care of the Birds of Prey.” An equally large-scale mistake was the importation of prickly pear cactus to Australia to create hedges. Without control of its numbers by natural regulators, the species began to grow massively and transformed


the country's fields into cactus thickets (


Fig


. 43.1). Even tractors got stuck in these thickets. The problem was solved only by importing from America a natural regulator of the number
of prickly pears - the cactus moth. The larvae of this insect
feed


on prickly pear tissues and can control its spread. An interesting problem associated with ¬


ignorance of some ecological aspects arose during the settlement of Australia. To better feed the imported livestock, Australian farmers began to sow clover. But the clover in their fields did not want to reproduce, although it grew well. The reason for this was the absence of bumblebees. Only bumblebees had a long enough proboscis to be able to reach the nectaries of clover flowers and pollinate them (Fig. 43.2). Bees could not do this. Bumblebees also had to be imported to Australia. This made it possible to solve such an important agricultural problem. The lack of ecological knowledge often causes the appearance of so-called alien species (invasive species). Such species are often imported for economic purposes, but once in new conditions, they begin to multiply without limit and become the cause of the extinction of local species. This happened, for example, with one of the American species of crayfish. It was brought to Europe because of its resistance to diseases and rapid growth. However, this crayfish created a serious problem not only for the local broad-toothed crayfish, but also for the species it hunts.


Ecological thinking Therefore, without comprehensive knowledge of ecology, human interaction with natural ecosystems can cause real ecological disasters. The result is the extermination of living organisms, disruption of the relationships between components in ecosystems, and a threat to human health and life. In order to take into account the laws of ecology, a person in the modern world should develop his ecological thinking. Ecological thinking is the consideration
of phenomena and events and decision-making taking into account the interactions of man
and humanity with the natural environment based on diverse and deep knowledge about the environment and a responsible attitude to nature and human health.


157. Topic 8


Ecological thinking allows us to understand that all organisms and processes on our planet are interconnected. Accordingly, the need for international cooperation to solve environmental problems becomes clear, because it is impossible to do this alone. Ecological thinking is necessary for critical perception of information. It allows us to draw the right conclusions and make adequate decisions. This encourages a person to preserve both his life and health and the life and health of other people.


Practical application of ecological thinking Modern mass media provide a large amount of information, including that related to environmental issues. But such information is often aimed at achieving a certain goal - political or economic. After all, in this way it is possible to influence consumer decision-making. Ecological thinking allows you to critically perceive information and make the right decisions. A good example of the possibility of applying ecological thinking is the analysis of various myths that are spread through television and the Internet. For example, it is quite common to hear that a person is capable of destroying all life on Earth. This point of view does not agree with reality. Even under the worst conditions of a nuclear war, ecosystems will remain on the planet that are capable of existing relatively independently for a long time. These are ecosystems of large caves, underwater ecosystems formed around “black fires”, the producers of which are chemoautotrophs, ecosystems of groundwater, etc. All of them have a fairly high chance of survival under the worst conditions. However, ecosystems that are comfortable for humanity to live in
can be destroyed quite easily by humans themselves. Therefore, it is more correct to say that
humans can destroy humanity in general and the conditions for their existence on Earth in particular. An equally popular myth is the statement that everything of natural origin is good. In fact, nature produces a large number of products dangerous to human health and life (toxins of bacteria and fungi, alkaloids of plants, products of decay of dead organic matter, etc.). Therefore, natural products and materials should be treated with caution. At one time, the lack of ecological thinking caused a large number of problems during the construction of the Dnieper cascade of power plants. The dams built blocked the Dnieper riverbed, hid the Dnieper rapids and provided many metallurgical enterprises with electricity (Fig. 43.3). But the consequence of this was


the


flooding


of ¬
large areas with fertile soils, the need to resettle a large number of settlements, the difficulty of the Dnieper self-purification processes and obstacles to fish spawning in the upper reaches of the river. Perhaps other options for building hydroelectric power plants on the Dnieper would have caused less harm to local ecosystems. But correcting such mistakes also requires the use of ecological thinking. Because thoughtlessness in this case can cause
great harm. Yes, if all the dams
of power plants are eliminated at the same time now, nothing good will happen to local ecosystems. Local ecosystems have long adapted to the existing groundwater level. After the dams are destroyed, this level will drop significantly. The result will be a massive drying out of forests throughout the Dnieper basin, because the trees simply will not have time to rebuild their root system to the new location of the water horizons. Accordingly, forest animals will also suffer, and the ecological catastrophe will be large-scale.


A classic example of the implementation of ecological thinking was the understanding of the role of refrigerators in the emergence of the problem of the ozone layer of the atmosphere. The use of freon as a coolant turned out to be a very convenient technological solution. But after the refrigerators were no longer in operation, freon would enter the atmosphere and destroy the ozone layer. And this created a direct threat to the health of the population of all countries. The solution was found by replacing Freon with other coolants..Main provisions of the topic "Sustainable development

animals are bred on farms in your area?


Breeding as a science Breeding is the science of methods for creating new and improving existing varieties of plants, breeds of animals and strains of microorganisms. Thanks to selection, it was possible to obtain a great variety of forms of domesticated living organisms. Selection arose a long time ago, back in the period when man had just begun to master agriculture and animal husbandry. At the first stages of selection, scientific methods were not used, but this was compensated by the rich practical experience of people who had been engaged in this all their lives, and the considerable duration of the selection process. Gradually, certain rules and techniques of selection were formed. Thus, already in the times of Ancient Phoenicia (more than three thousand years ago), methods of artificial pollination of date palms were used (Fig. 44.1). Until the 19th century, the practice of selection included, in particular, compiling pedigrees of animals of valuable breeds and planning pairs for crossing. The intensity of the work of breeders increased significantly after the emergence of genetics. It was then that selection received a theoretical basis for its work. The nature of inheritance of ba

first objects of selection


for many traits in cultivated plants and domestic animals.
Induced mutagenesis began to be practiced when
plants or animals were exposed to chemical or radiation mutagens, obtaining a large number of new forms among their descendants. And after establishing the structure of DNA, the era of molecular biological methods in selection began. Depending on the objects with which breeders work, several branches of selection are distinguished: animals, plants, microorganisms, etc.


Selection tasks Selection studies are aimed at meeting the needs of ¬


human life: obtaining high-quality agricultural products, in particular food products and industrial crops. The main tasks of selection are: breeding plant varieties with high yields; breeding animal breeds with high productivity; breeding plant and animal forms resistant to diseases and adverse factors; ensuring the adaptation of varieties and breeds to the conditions of modern agricultural production; reducing the costs of growing plants and animals. Achievements of selection The results of the work of breeders have become a guarantee of increasing the efficiency of agriculture. If in the 19th century the average yield of wheat was no more than 5–8 centners per hectare, then at the beginning of the 21st century in the EU countries it reached 55 centners per hectare. It was thanks to painstaking selection work in the middle of the 20th century that the “Green Revolution” was achieved in world agriculture, the result of which was a significant increase in the world's agricultural production. At that time, without such a revolution, it would have been impossible to provide the planet's population (which was growing rapidly)
with a sufficient amount of food.
The result of selection work was the creation of thousands of varieties of cultivated plants and dozens and hundreds of breeds of domestic animals. 163
