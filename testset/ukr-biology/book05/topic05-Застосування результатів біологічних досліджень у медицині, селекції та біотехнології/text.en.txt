Visual evidence of the effective work of breeders is the increase in the average yield of agricultural crops in different countries (Fig. 44.2, 44.3). Wheat had two periods of sharp growth - in the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries. Potatoes and corn also had significant increases in yield in the 1940s–1960s. This was a consequence of the Green Revolution and is a very good indication of the success of breeding work based on classical genetics technologies.

Fig. 44.4. Wild banana fruits contain many seeds, are smaller in size and not as tasty


Another achievement of selection is the improvement of the quality indicators of domesticated species (Fig. 44.4). For example, if we compare the watermelons depicted in the 17th century painting (Fig. 44.5) with modern watermelons, we can see that four hundred years ago there was very little edible pulp in watermelons. They had a thick skin and many seeds. Modern watermelons are much more pleasant and convenient to eat thanks to the hard work of breeders.


Today, potatoes and sunflowers are important food plants. But at the time when they came to Europe from America, they were not used for food. Both of these crops were originally ornamental plants.


The first domesticated pigs came to Europe from the Middle East and originated in Asia. But within about 500 years, these pigs were displaced by domesticated forms
of the European wild boar. And by the beginning of our era, all pigs in Europe were already of local
origin. Only 300–400 years ago, pigs from Asia began to be imported to Europe again and used for crossing with local breeds. Breeding in Ukraine

Modern methods of selection

Why is there still a need to breed new varieties of plants ¬
and animal breeds, although there is a great diversity of them? What factors increase the number of mutations in living organisms ¬
? What is natural selection? What factors of natural selection are considered in modern evolutionary theory?


Variety of selection methods Methods of selection of plants, animals and microorganisms are quite diverse, and they are used taking into account the peculiarities of the biology of each of these groups. Therefore, the technologies of selection research for all these organisms are somewhat different. Selection methods can be divided into classical methods and methods using modern biotechnology. It should be noted that classical methods in modern breeding continue to be widely used. The emergence of molecular biological methods has only expanded the possibilities of breeding work.

Some breeding methods using modern biotechnology Rapid microclonal propagation method One of the most promising modern breeding methods is the rapid microclonal propagation method. It consists in growing a culture of plant cells on nutrient media (Fig. 45.1). For this, pieces of callus (undifferentiated) plant tissue are placed on a nutrient medium, where, under the influence of added phytohormones, cell differentiation occurs and the root and shoot of a new plant are formed. The method was called microclonal because of the very small size of tissue samples (in raspberries - 2 mm, in hops - 0.1 mm, etc.) required for growing a new plant. The main advantages of the method are the ability to conduct research (or grow new organisms) throughout the year, regardless of external conditions, and this requires a small area. In addition, this technology allows for rapid propagation of woody plants, which under normal conditions require many years to reproduce. The advantages of the method include
the possibility of rapid propagation
of plants that reproduce poorly vegetatively or are not capable of this type of reproduction at all. In this way, it is possible to propagate, for example, coniferous plants, the cuttings of which in nature take root extremely slowly (more than a year). This technology also greatly facilitates the propagation of interesting genetic forms for breeding work. From one unique plant specimen, several thousand specimens can be grown without changing the unique genotype in the process of sexual reproduction.

Somatic hybridization method Another very promising method that is actively used in breeding is somatic hybridization. It occurs by fusing somatic cells. In this way, it is possible to obtain even hybrids between organisms that are incapable of interbreeding (rat and mouse, oats and corn, etc.), or between cells of different tissues of representatives of the same species. One of the promising directions of somatic hybridization is the production of hybridomas (hybrid cells created by the fusion of lymphocytes and cancer cells). Hybridomas are used in the field of biotechnology when creating highly efficient cell lines for the production of valuable drugs used for the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases (oncological diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma, etc.). Hybridomas combine the ability of a lymphocyte to form the necessary antibodies (of one type, the so-called monoclonal antibodies) and the ability of tumor cells to multiply indefinitely in artificial ¬
media. With the help of hybridomas, it is possible to obtain antibodies of the required type in unlimited quantities (Fig. 45.2).


Application of breeding methods on the example of citrus *Citrus is a large group of plants from the Rutaceae family, the most famous representatives of which belong to the genus Citrus (Citrus). Lemons, tangerines, grapefruits, oranges are all well-known representatives
of this genus of plants.
Citrus originated in Southeast Asia and were domesticated in the same region. The main breeding methods in this group were hybridization and selection of mutant variants of mainly somatic origin. In addition to species from the genus Citrus, representatives of other genera from the citrus group, such as kumquat or micrantha (some researchers also refer these plants to the genus Citrus), were involved in the breeding of domestic plants of this group.

The initial forms for citrus breeding were three species: citron ( Citrus medica ), tangerine ( Citrus reticulata ) and pomelo ( Citrus maxima ). Most cultivated citrus fruits (lemons, grapefruits, oranges, etc.) are hybrids of these three species. They hybridized in different sequences and in different directions and contain different percentages of genes from each species (Fig. 45.3). Some citrus fruits are hybrids of two species. Thus, orange is a hybrid of pomelo and tangerine, red lemon - of tangerine and citron, calamondin - of kumquat and tangerine. The history of the creation of different varieties of orange is interesting. They originate from a single hybrid of mandarin, pomelo and citron, but were formed as a result of various somatic mutations
that could occur in a certain part of the tree or even in a separate branch.
And grapefruit was formed as a result of hybridization of orange and pomelo. The genetic history of mandarins turned out to be quite confusing. They can be divided into three groups. The first of them is formed by Tachibana mandarin and several Chinese varieties. Its representatives are the initial form for citrus fruits and do not have signs of crossing with other species. The second and third groups of mandarin varieties arose as a result of hybridization of mandarins of the first group with pomelo. They differ in the content of pomelo genes. In mandarins of the second group, such genes are up to 10%, and in mandarins of the third - from 12 to 38%..Topic 9

Fig. 46.1. Manifestation of the heterosis effect and its ¬
gradual disappearance in corn hybrids


What is heterosis People have long noticed one interesting pattern. If you cross different breeds of animals or varieties of plants, you can get offspring that will exceed both of their parents in certain characteristics. But for a long time it was not possible to predict such results, because sometimes the effect was observed, and sometimes not. The situation was changed only with the beginning of the scientific organization of the selection process. It was then that it was proven that the first generation of hybrids obtained as a result of unrelated crossing has a number of valuable indicators, by which it significantly exceeds both of its parents. Such indicators were viability, productivity, growth, resistance to diseases, etc. To describe this effect, the American geneticist G. Schell proposed the term “heterosis” (1914). A characteristic feature of heterosis was that it was most pronounced in the first generation of hybrids. In subsequent generations (second, third, etc.), the manifestation of heterosis gradually decreased, and then disappeared altogether (Fig. 46.1). In plants, three main types of heterosis are distinguished according
to those indicators that are most observed ¬
in ¬a particular hybrid
: reproductive, somatic, and adaptive. Reproductive heterosis is manifested in an increase in seed production and yield. Plants with somatic heterosis have significantly greater


vegetative mass and larger linear dimensions. Adaptive heterosis is manifested in an increase in the resistance of plants to the action of adverse environmental factors (both physical and biological).


Genetic


bases
of


heterosis


To
explain


the


phenomenon


of


heterosis,


two main hypotheses were proposed, which, by the way, did not exclude each other


(


Fig. 46.2). The first of them is the dominance hypothesis. Its main idea is to block the action of recessive alleles of genes that cause an adverse effect by dominant alleles of the same gene. The hypothesis was based on the fact that in the two parental lines in the homozygous state for the recessive allele there will be different genes. And after crossing, most genes will have at least one dominant allele, which will not allow the negative effect of the recessive allele to manifest itself. This hypothesis well explained the fact that the effect of heterosis began to decrease sharply in the second generation of hybrids and disappeared altogether after a few generations. The second was the hypothesis of superiority (overdominance). It stated that the advantage of heterosis hybrids is given by unique combinations of alleles that were formed as a result of such crossing, that is, the heterozygote Aa gives a greater effect than the homozygotes AA or aa. This hypothesis also adequately explained the decrease in the effect of heterosis in subsequent generations of hybrids. Long-term studies have revealed some advantage of the dominance hypothesis. But the advantage hypothesis has also received several experimental confirmations in its favor. And already in the 21st century, data appeared that indicate a significant contribution to this phenomenon of epigenetic mechanisms.


Practical significance of heterosis
The phenomenon of heterosis is widely used in agricultural practice. It is used when growing corn, rice, sugar beets and other cereals and vegetables. Almost all corn,

Fig. 46.3. The scheme of production of hybrids of corn based on inbred lines


which is now grown in the world is heterosis. A significant part of rice which is grown in China and India is also hybrid. To obtain hybrid plants in seed farms special so-called inbred lines of plants are grown in which by means of constant self-pollination a high level of homozygosity is maintained (Fig. 46.3). To obtain seeds of heterosis hybrids, different inbred lines are crossed with each other every year, and the seeds formed
as a result of crossing are
used to obtain high yields. The phenomenon of heterosis is also used in animal husbandry. It gives a good effect for some hybrids of cattle and pigs (Fig. 46.4). Heterosis hybrids are also used on poultry farms to obtain hybrids of chickens. An interesting study of dog hybrids was conducted some time ago. In its Fig. 46.4. Heterosis hybrids of dairy cows

process it was found that hybrid dog breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds.

varieties of the same plant species or breeds of the same animal species can give
different effects of heterosis during crossings. In some crosses, hybrids will be
larger, in others - greater resistance to diseases or high yield. And in some cases, after crossings, the effect of heterosis may not manifest itself..Topic 9


Homologous series of hereditary variability. The origin of cultivated plants


47


When did humanity begin to transition to agriculture ¬
and a sedentary lifestyle? In which regions and when did this process occur? What is heredity? What is variability ¬
? What types of variability exist? On what factors does the yield of agricultural plants depend?


The phenomenon of homologous series of hereditary variability At the beginning of the 20th century, M. I. Vavilov studied the variability of traits in several genera of cereals. He drew attention to the fact that in representatives of different genera, the variability of traits occurs in a similar way. If there are dwarf forms or forms with a long spine in one genus, then these same variants can be found in other genera (Fig. 47.1). There were many such signs, and they formed entire sequences of identical variants of variability. In fact, this phenomenon was already known at that time. For example, it was described in his work by C. Darwin, referring to earlier studies by other scientists. But M. I. Vavilov first formulated it as a separate law of homologous series of variability and gave a genetic explanation for this phenomenon. The formulation of this law is as follows: “Genetically close genera and species have similar series of hereditary variability. Knowing what forms exist in one species, one can predict the existence of the same forms in other species and genera related to it.” He believed that the presence of such series of variability in related genera is a consequence of their descent ¬from a common ancestor. This ancestor
passed on to its descendants very similar sets of genes, each of which can


vary only within certain limits. Therefore, the variability in related systematic groups is similar.


And the greater the kinship, the more similar


the variability series. M. I. Vavilov proposed using the presence of such a pattern in


the practical


work of breeders. Knowing what variants occur ¬
in close genera, it was possible to purposefully search for the necessary forms in the species with which the selection work was carried out. He managed to use the knowledge of this law to analyze the processes of domestication of cultivated plants and establish the centers of their origin.


Domestication of cultivated plantsDomestication is the process of changing plant or animal populations, due to which they become adapted to being kept in captivity and
used by humans. Domestication occurs with the aim of obtaining
food, industrial products (leather, fiber, etc.) from plants and animals, or for other purposes (transport, protection, etc.) (Fig. 47.2). Most species were domesticated between 2 and 12 thousand years ago. Domestication of plants by humans occurred independently in different regions of our planet. And all these regions had certain characteristics. In addition to favorable climatic conditions, the presence of some plant species with sufficiently large fruits and a sufficient number of people and certain social conditions were also required for the formation of settled settlements. For example, the climate of certain regions of Australia is very favorable for growing cereals. But all Australian cereal species have very small seeds. And it makes no sense to grow them for grain. But after the introduction of cereal grains from Europe to this country, the situation changed, and Australia became one of the world leaders in grain production. Therefore, there were only a few centers of origin of plants. These centers were discovered by the outstanding scientist, geneticist and breeder M. I. Vavilov.


Centers of origin of cultivated plantsThe oldest center of origin of cultivated plants is considered to be the region of the “Fertile Crescent”, named so for the silhouette of this region

The number of domesticated species was of great importance for the development of civilizations in the regions of the centers of origin of cultivated plants. The greater the number of species that were domesticated, the more diverse and


balanced


the


nutrition of the population became. Accordingly, the health of the population was better, and its number increased at a rapid pace.
It should be noted that the centers of origin of cultivated plants
coincide with the centers of origin of domestic animals (Fig. 47.5). Although not all centers of plant origin domestication of animals occurred. This was due to the presence in the region of plant domestication of those species of animals that could be domesticated. These two processes occurred in parallel and influenced each other. For example, the domestication of cattle and horses in Eurasia made it possible to create a system of tillage with a plow or a plow, which could be pulled by oxen or horses. In America, there were no such animals, and growing cereals there required large amounts of manual labor. Topic 9


Genetic and Cellular Engineering in Modern Breeding


48


What cells are called stem cells? How do stem ¬
cells differ from ordinary cells of the human body? How do viruses penetrate the cells of living organisms? Why are some viruses embedded in the DNA of the host cell?


Cell engineeringCell engineering is a branch of biotechnology that develops and uses technologies for cultivating cells and tissues outside the body in artificial conditions. In addition, cell hybridization technologies are developed and used within the framework of cell engineering. One of the areas of cell engineering is the cloning of animals and plants (Fig. 48.1). Plant cloning, for example, allows for very rapid reproduction of the most valuable plant individuals, which are characterized by high yield, increased resistance to diseases, or other qualities. Cloning is often used to reproduce unique decorative forms of plants. One of the achievements of cell engineering was the development of methods for using
stem cells in human treatment (Fig. 48.2). The ability
to unlimited division and to transform into different cell types (so-called


pluripotency )


makes


them ideal material for transplantation ¬
therapy


.


Adult


stem


cells are considered


the most accessible. However,


their


real potential


for
differentiation


is


still


poorly understood. Human embryonic stem cells are extremely attractive for use in medicine: they can be used to obtain any type of cell in the body. Once in the body during transplantation, stem cells continue to divide and find a place where their help is most needed. This ability of stem cells is called homing.


Genetic engineering Genetic (gene) engineering is a branch of biotechnology that develops ¬


and uses technologies for isolating genes from organisms and individual
cells, modifying them and introducing them into other cells or organisms. The essence of genetic engineering is to artificially create genes with the desired properties and introduce them into the appropriate cell. Gene transfer is carried out by a vector (recombinant DNA) - a special DNA molecule, constructed on the basis of viral DNA or plasmids, which contains the desired gene and is able to transport it to the cell and ensure its integration into its genetic apparatus. Genetic engineering is widely used both in scientific research and in the latest breeding methods. The use of genetic engineering in the field of breeding has caused active controversy. Various scientists and activists of public organizations have presented arguments both "for" and "against" the use of this technology. Among the positive arguments are increased yield, environmental benefits, protection from pests. On the other hand, some consumers are unsure about the safety of new technologies. Theoretically, the negative impact of, for example, plants obtained using genetic engineering technology on other organisms is possible due to the presence of biologically active substances (insecticides, fungicides, etc.) in the plant organism. The impact of these substances can be direct or indirect through trophic chains. However, to date, no reliable experimental data on the negative impact of such organisms on non-target species have been obtained.


181. Topic 9


In Europe, the use of genetically engineered soybean and corn plants for the production of food products has been permitted since 1997, and food enzymes and additives obtained as a result of genetic engineering have been used for over twenty years. However, in many European countries, food legislation contains requirements for the safety of products of this origin.


Genetically modified organisms Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms
whose genotype has been changed using genetic engineering methods using
recombinant DNA technology. Another name for genetically modified organisms is transgenic organisms. To create genetically modified organisms, such methods of gene transfer as creating a vector based on a bacterial plasmid and bombarding cells with a gene gun are often used (Fig. 48.3). As you already know, a vector is a DNA molecule that is capable of being integrated into the genome of a cell and contains a gene that is foreign to this cell. Such vectors can be created on the basis of bacterial plasmids of bacteria of the genus Agrobacterium. This is due to the fact that such bacteria in natural conditions have developed the ability to actively carry out horizontal ¬
gene transfer between their cells and the cells of the plant on which they parasitize (Fig. 48.4). If bacteria and plant cells are placed in one culture, then vectors based on bacterial plasmids will transfer the gene into the genome of plant cells. A gene gun uses very small particles of heavy metals (gold, silver, tungsten) to introduce into the genome of cells, on which

DNA is applied. These particles are shot at a cell culture using compressed air. In this case, some of the cells die, but some remain alive and receive a foreign gene.

Use of GMOs Such organisms can be of great importance for increasing the efficiency of agriculture and during research in the field of molecular biology. The first genetically modified organisms obtained using molecular biology methods appeared in the world only in the 80s of the 20th century. Currently, genetically modified organisms belonging to microorganisms, animals and plants are widely used in various branches of the economy. Microorganisms are used for the synthesis of human proteins (insulin, growth hormone, etc.), which are used in medicine. Examples of genetically modified animals are salmon (the gene built into the genome ensured a high growth rate of the fish) and goats (the new gene ensures that its mammary glands produce milk with substances valuable for health). Genetically modified plants (soybean, corn, etc.) have increased resistance to pests, diseases, and adverse weather conditions. Topic 9


Human Genetic Engineering. Bioethical Issues

What are hereditary diseases? What hereditary ¬
human diseases do you know? Can they be treated? How can you prevent ¬
the birth of a child with a hereditary disease? What are somatic cells? What is a vector? How do gene mutations differ from chromosomal and genomic mutations?


Using human genetic engineering technologies Genetic (gene) engineering is extremely widely used in modern biology and medicine. In scientific research, genetic engineering allows you to purposefully "turn off" or "turn on" the necessary genes. This helps to study their functions. Genetic engineering technologies are actively used for the diagnosis of diseases. Infectious, hereditary diseases, as well as various forms of cancer can be diagnosed in this way. This diagnosis is based on the recognition of specific sections of nucleic acids - DNA or RNA. This method has very high sensitivity and high reliability. For example, it takes several days to determine a specific pathogen of angina using traditional methods, because the bacterial culture must first be grown and only then determined. And using DNA analysis, the pathogen can be determined on the day the sample is taken.


Gene therapy The logical development of human genetic engineering technologies was the creation of a new direction in medicine - gene therapy. Gene therapy is a set of technologies that provides changes in the genetic apparatus of human somatic cells. Its main purpose is the treatment of hereditary diseases and diseases associated with impaired gene regulation (for example, cancer). New research directions are constantly emerging in this field, and their total number increases every year (Fig. 49.1


). The main idea underlying gene therapy technologies is the replacement of
a defective gene in cells with a normal one. There are two main methods used for this. The first is the introduction of a gene into
the


desired cells directly in the body using a vector. The second is the introduction of a


gene into cells that


are previously isolated from the body and then reintroduced back into the body (Fig. 49.2). Gene


therapy already


has examples of successful application, but so far all these


studies


are experimental (only on volunteers). After all, the technology is complex and requires a detailed study of possible risks and negative consequences.


CRISPR technology
One of the newest methods of gene therapy is CRISPR technology (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats). This system was discovered in 2012. It is used by bacteria to protect themselves from bacteriophage viruses. The principle of operation of this system is as follows. The bacterium incorporates a small piece of viral DNA into its DNA and creates a complex

protein complex containing this sequence. Using such a marker sequence, the protein complex easily identifies the DNA of a virus that can penetrate the cell and neutralizes it. The main advantage of such a system is the ability to identify a very small section of DNA. Therefore, gene therapy methods created on the basis of this technology have the ability to find a specific section of a certain gene in the cell's genome and cut it out or replace it with another. The CRISPR system
has become a very precise tool that can work with both individual
genes and their sections. In recent years, several articles have been published about the successful use of this method. For example, scientists from the United States managed to successfully correct a defective gene at the stage of one-cell human embryos. This was done in 42 embryos out of 58.


Production of drugs Another area of use of genetic engineering technologies has become the production of drugs for therapeutic treatment. Some of the modern drugs simply cannot be obtained in any other way. Such drugs have been used for quite some time. Since 1982, the mass use of insulin produced by genetically modified bacteria (Fig. 49.3) has begun. The human insulin gene was artificially transferred to the mentioned bacteria. Before that, insulin from pigs and calves was used in the treatment of diabetes, which often caused complications and allergic reactions. In addition to insulin, genetically modified organisms are used to produce growth hormone, interferon, drugs for the treatment of myocardial infarction, cystic fibrosis, a number of forms of cancer and other diseases.

Bioethical problems of modern medicine Modern biotechnologies are widely used in medicine. Thanks to them, it has become possible to transplant tissues and organs, obtain stem cells, and treat a large number of diseases that were considered incurable until recently. But all these areas of modern medicine make the problem of bioethics - the moral aspects of the use of these technologies - relevant. The main problems of bioethics today are: taking material for organ and tissue transplantation; use of human embryos in research; use of human embryos as a source of stem cells;
interference with the genetic apparatus of unborn children;
human cloning; surrogate motherhood. The basic principles of bioethics, which it is desirable to adhere to in order to avoid ethical problems, were proposed by American scientists T. L. Beauchamp and J. F. Childress (1985). Principles of bioethics: the principle of autonomy (an individual has the right to manage his or her own health); the principle of "do no harm" (requires minimizing harm from medical intervention); the principle of beneficence (a doctor is obliged to take actions aimed at improving the patient's condition); the principle of justice (requires equal treatment of all patients and equal access to resources for medical care)..Topic 9

Biotechnology and its directionsBiotechnology is a set of industrial methods used to produce various substances using living organisms, biological processes or phenomena. The term "biotechnology" itself appeared in the 70s of the 20th century. But in fact, people developed biotechnological principles a long time ago. A number of food products were produced with the help of microorganisms back in Ancient Egypt. Biotechnology is closely related to other sciences. It develops on the basis of the achievements of many scientific fields and itself contributes to their development (Fig. 50.1). Modern biotechnology is widely used in various fields:
medicine, production of various food and non-food products,
for environmental protection and within the framework of the concept of rational use of nature, etc. (Fig. 50.2).

Fig. 50.2. Fields of application of biotechnology


Traditional fields of application of microorganisms are currently expanding. With the help of microorganisms, medicines are obtained (for example, hormonal drugs, drugs for the treatment of heart attacks and hereditary diseases, etc.). All citric acid sold in our stores is produced by microorganisms. In the same way, monosodium glutamate is also obtained, which is a flavor enhancer and is widely used as a food additive. Living organisms are also used as means of combating pests
and plant diseases. The use of natural pathogens of
pest diseases is much safer than treatment with pesticides. Although this method has its drawbacks - slow action, for example. And another new industry is the production of enzymes for household chemicals. Every time you buy, say, a washing powder with enzymes, you use biotechnology products. Biotechnology is also actively used in the field of environmental protection. A significant part of modern water purification systems includes biological purification complexes, in which microorganisms neutralize harmful substances. Higher aquatic vegetation is often used for this purpose (bio plateau technology). Planting forests is one of the ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which can reduce the rate of global warming.

Biotechnological methods are widely used in such branches of medicine as reproductive medicine and transplantology. Reproductive medicine deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility in humans. This problem has become relevant due to the increase in the number of cases of infertility due to the constant impact on populations of anthropogenic factors, primarily physical, chemical and biological pollution of the environment ¬


. It is based on the use of the latest developments in endocrinology, surgery, genetic engineering and other fields. Well-proven and popular technologies of reproductive medicine are artificial insemination technologies - in vitro (outside the woman's body) and intracorporeal (in the woman's body) fertilization (Fig. 50.3). To do this, a large number of problems had to be solved, including the problems of obtaining human germ cells, assessing their condition, long-term storage and correction of existing genetic defects (if necessary). Transplantation is the transplantation of an organ or tissue that was taken from the donor's body to the recipient. Transplanted organs and tissues are called grafts. Both the body's own organs (for example, skin) and the organs and tissues of other people or even some animals can be used for transplantation. The main problem of transplantation is overcoming the immune barrier. The body's immune system recognizes any foreign organs and tissues and begins to attack them, trying to destroy foreign cells. This causes
the death and rejection of transplants. To prevent
this process, doctors have to suppress the patient's immune system with special drugs. But the reverse effect of such suppression is an increase in the risk of developing infectious and oncological diseases. To avoid the problem of the immune barrier, the creation of new organs using the patient's own stem cells by 3D printing could potentially be the best transplantation technology.

Successes in creating genetically modified organismsGenetically modified organs ¬


Fig. 50.4. "Golden rice"


The science has become the successful basis for many projects related to solving food and medical problems. The first major success was the creation of genetically modified bacteria that produced human insulin. Before that, diabetics had to take injections of insulin, which was extracted from the pancreases of pigs and calves. And it could often cause allergic reactions. A significant achievement was the creation of a genetically modified variety of rice, known as "golden rice" (Fig. 50.4). Thanks to genes from daffodils and the bacterium Erwinia, this rice gained the ability to produce beta-carotene and became an excellent source of vitamin A. Every year, 1 to 2 million
people die in the world due to a deficiency of this vitamin in food. This variety of rice got its name from the golden color
of its seeds. Genetically modified animals are used no less actively than plants. Thus, in 2009, the use of drugs produced from the milk of genetically modified goats was approved. The milk of these goats contains a substance that is an anticoagulant and reduces the risk of blood clots during and after surgical operations..Topic 9


Biological Hazard and Biological Protection

What dangerous animals and plants are found in your region? Why are they dangerous to humans? What diseases ¬
can humans get from animals? How do the pathogens of these diseases enter the human body? What multicellular ¬
animals can be pathogens of human diseases?


Biological Hazard


Fig. 51.1. Official sign of biological hazard


Biological Hazard Unfortunately, the interaction of living organisms with humans can have not only a positive effect. Therefore, the concept of biological hazard was proposed - the negative effect of biological objects, which creates insecurity in the medical and social, technological, agricultural or communal spheres (Fig. 51.1). The source of biological hazard can be representatives of any
group of living organisms (Fig. 51.2). First of all, these are, of course,
pathogenic microorganisms - viruses, bacteria, parasitic fungi and unicellular eukaryotes. They can be the cause of epidemics and, possibly, the death of a large number of people. It should be noted that non-pathogenic microorganisms can also create a significant biological hazard. For example, clostridia, which produce botulinum toxin, are not parasites. They feed on dead organic matter, and the poison is secreted so that competitors do not prevent them from eating it. But canned food is also dead organic matter, bacteria can settle in them and produce botulinum toxin, which causes botulism. Biological hazard can also occur as a side effect of the vital activity of microorganisms, with which humans do not even compete. Thus, the "blooming" of water as a result of the mass reproduction of microscopic algae negatively affects the health of people who are at such a moment near a reservoir. The reason for this is not only toxic substances secreted by algae, but also the decay products of the bodies of organisms that died as a result of the "blooming" of water.

poison and with the ability to sometimes accumulate toxins (for example, in completely edible filter-feeding mollusks)


193. Topic 9


Biological terrorism Biological terrorism is a type of terrorism in which biological weapons are used against the population. Usually, pathogens of dangerous infections or toxins produced by them are used as biological weapons. Bioterrorism can attack either directly the population (using pathogens of diseases such as anthrax, plague, smallpox, etc.) or the economy of a certain region. In the latter case, not pathogens of human diseases are used, but organisms that affect farm animals or cultivated plants. This option acts more slowly, but is safer for the terrorists themselves. In recent years, several terrorist attacks using biological weapons have been carried out: 1972 - USA, Chicago. Attempt to infect the city's water ¬


supply system with pathogens of typhoid fever. The terrorists were arrested before the terrorist attack began, there were no victims. 1984 - USA, Oregon. Infection with salmonella in bars, restaurants and shops. 751 people fell ill. There were no deaths. 1993 — Japan, Tokyo. Attempt to infect crowded places with anthrax pathogens. No victims. 2001 — USA. Mailing of letters with anthrax pathogens. 5 people died.


Biological protection and biological safety
To prevent the negative consequences of biological hazards and biological terrorism, biological protection systems are created. Bio


Fig. 51.4. Quarantine and vaccination are important components of the biological protection system


194. Application of the results of biological research


logical protection is a system of complex measures aimed at timely detection of biological hazards and ensuring protection of the population from them in the relevant territories (Fig. 51.4). Biological protection involves the implementation of administrative and economic, regime-restrictive and special anti-epidemic and medical measures. In most countries, modern health care systems create fairly reliable biological protection complexes. Surveillance systems for the spread of dangerous infections allow for timely detection of disease cases and limiting their spread. And notification through the media contributes to the correct actions of the population in conditions of danger. Depending on the type of biological hazard, actions to reduce its impact on people will be different. Thus, the spread of respiratory infections requires the widespread use of respirators or other means of respiratory protection. And infections that enter the body with food require control of food products and compliance with personal hygiene rules. A mandatory component of biological protection of the population is systematic and timely vaccination of the population. It is mass vaccination that prevents the spread of infections. Therefore, timely vaccination is very important for preserving the life and health of the population. Another important concept is the concept of biological safety. Biological safety is a state of the human living environment in which there is no harmful effect of environmental factors on the person himself and his future descendants. In such an environment ¬
, there is also no negative impact on biological objects of the natural
(organisms of natural ecosystems) and artificial (domestic animals, cultivated plants) environment. The main provisions of the topic "Application of

Biology and global problems of mankind


52


What sciences are included in biology? What research methods ¬
does biology use? What problems does ecology study? Why are environmental problems very relevant in the modern world ¬
? Why are environmental problems associated with the production and operation of motor vehicles global?


Global problems of modernity Modern society is forced to solve various problems. But some of these problems have become global and cover the entire planet. These are, for example, food shortages, human disturbance of ecosystems, environmental pollution by products of activity, and climate change. Unfortunately, it is impossible to objectively assess how these problems affect human development. And not all problems can be solved with a reliable algorithm. But in many cases, biology can come to the aid of a person. Living organisms have existed on our planet for several
billion years, and all this time they have been looking for ways to solve a
huge number of issues. Living nature has a great potential that can be used to solve problematic issues. Already now, living organisms play an important role in the purification of wastewater and a renewable source of energy by producing biogas by microorganisms (Fig. 52.1).


Food problem The problem of food shortage concerns primarily humans and is not very closely related to the existence of the biosphere. But it should be taken into account that humanity takes resources for obtaining food from the biosphere. There are practically no free places left on the planet suitable for increasing the area of agricultural production. Therefore, it is impossible to further increase food production by expanding agricultural land. In addition, another important task related to the food problem is to ensure adequate nutrition, that is, the food products of each person should be diverse and contain all the necessary substances. Biology has already solved such a problem once. In the middle


of the


20th century, the "green revolution" made it possible to eliminate the threat of hunger by significantly increasing the yield of cultivated plants. This was achieved using methods of classical selection and chemicalization of agriculture. Today, a sharp increase in the productivity of cultivated plants is possible provided that molecular biology technologies are introduced, in particular, the creation of genetically modified organisms.


Disruption of ecosystems Population growth and increased industrial production are perhaps the main factors in increasing human pressure on natural ecosystems.
The consequence of such pressure was the extinction of many species of organisms,
the disruption of trophic relationships in ecosystems and an increased risk of destruction and disappearance of individual ecosystems (Fig. 52.2).

SOURCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION


Household waste


Water pollution


Fig. 52.3. Sources of environmental pollution


A possible solution to this problem is the introduction of
rational ¬nature management and the expansion of the network of nature
conservation areas. Such areas will become a place for preserving biodiversity and a source of restoration of natural ecosystems in the event of restoration measures being implemented in areas that may be withdrawn from operation. Such options for solving the problem of ecosystem disruption optimally fit into the program for implementing the Concept of Sustainable Development.


Environmental pollution Another consequence of the intensive development of industry was a sharp increase in environmental pollution by products of human activity. These are production waste, garbage, and the results of accidents and disasters (Fig. 52.3). Today, a significant part of these products is not processed or is processed by living organisms very slowly. However, the prospects for the development of molecular biology and genetic engineering methods give hope that it will be possible to create organisms that could quickly and effectively process this garbage.


A feature of the climate change process is that it is accelerating. An increase in temperature causes glaciers to melt. Accordingly, a smaller area of glaciers reflects less sunlight into space. These rays heat ¬
the soil surface and increase its temperature even more. Therefore, those glaciers that still remain are melting faster. And this process is accelerating.


Climate change Another major problem of modern humanity is climate change. And although it is clear that man has made his contribution to this process, the specific magnitude of this contribution is still actively discussed.


200. Biology and global problems of mankind


Fig. 52.4. Consequences of global climate change


The consequences of climate change have been the massive melting of glaciers, the age of which ranges from hundreds of thousands to several million years. This, in turn, causes a number of significant ecological changes. The melting of glaciers saturates the ocean with a large amount of water. Accordingly, the ocean level rises, and coastal areas are flooded. And in the potential flood zone are located many large cities and an even greater number of small settlements. The result of rising sea levels will be the forced displacement of hundreds of millions of people and the loss of part of agricultural areas. Some inland water bodies (for example, the Aral Sea) have also been severely affected by climate change, which are drying up due to a lack of moisture (Fig. 52.4), which, as a result, affects the surrounding agricultural lands and causes soil degradation over vast areas. To solve this problem, the main task remains the utilization of excess greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide and methane. Scientists are currently actively searching for organisms that could do this with high efficiency..Laboratory
